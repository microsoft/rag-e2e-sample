    "This notebook demonstrates how we can generate a set of Questions and Answers based on chunks from a database. Documents chunked before insertion to a database and saved to `.csv` for MSFT transcripts sample. It is beneficial to generate questions and answers at this stage, as doing a search from a database has an added cost. Randomly picking chunks for specified filter parameters ensures diversity of the questions and answers. "
