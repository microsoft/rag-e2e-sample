Use “raise” as instructed.,
Use ""rise” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words12,"


Raise means ""lift"" and is a transitive verb, meaning it needs a subject and an object (i.e. subject + “raise” + object).

Be familiar with symptoms of going too fast.",How to Increase the Intensity of Any Exercise," Walking on a regular basis is a great low-impact exercise. It comes with many of the same benefits as jogging or running but without the hit to your knees and hips.Leisurely walking is great, but increase the intensity of your walks by:


Carry a 10–15 pound backpack while you walk. The extra weight makes your body work harder and increases the intensity of your walk.Avoid ankle or wrist weights, as these can lead to injury — remember that by weighting the end of a long lever (your wrist or ankle) you are putting a great load on the pivot (the shoulder, elbow, hip or knee joints). If you wish to use them, only wear them for the first five minutes of your walk, then put them in a backpack.
Increasing the incline on your treadmill during your walk. Or, if you walk outside, find a route that has a significant amount of hills.The hills will work your legs much harder than walking on a flat surface.
Walking on the sand if you live near a beach. It's difficult to push off in the sand and makes your feet and legs work significantly harder while you're walking.Racewalking. This is a type of very fast paced walking (about 6 to 8 mph or 9.6 to 12.9 km/h). You're working out on a level close to jogging or running.;
, Increasing the intensity of your regular runs or jogs can help you increase your overall speed and endurance.Try the following to increase the intensity of your runs:


Run hills or stairs. Find a new, hilly route or increase the incline on the treadmill; however, an even better way to increase intensity is by running stairs. Find a stadium with bleachers or a park with stairs.Include intervals of sprints and moderate-paced runs. Alternating your pace back and forth increases your heart rate significantly and can also help increase speed long-term.Increase the distance of your run by 1/4 of a mile each week. The longer you go the better trained your cardiovascular system will be.If you only run three times a week, try incorporating another day or two of running. This will help give your body extra conditioning., Getting in the pool for exercise is a great way to be active. It's low-impact and high resistance.You can up the intensity of your swim by:


Doing interval training. It's recommended to increase your speed every 50–100 meters until you reach your max effort. This can help increase your speed and performance.
Also try timed sets. Complete a certain amount of laps or strokes in a shorter period of time to force yourself to go faster.

, Cycling is a great aerobic exercise. Plus, there are a lot of things you can do to increase the intensity. Try:


Taking a spin class. These classes are naturally high in intensity and cause you to work very hard.
Build your own intervals by cycling on hilly terrain, alternating between high and low speeds or using an indoor bike and increasing the resistance.
If you train outside, use slightly deflated tires which will make the bike slower and force you to work harder.Avoid cycling in the city where there is traffic, lights and stop signs. Train in an area where you can go at high speeds for long distances without having to stop.

, Unlike aerobic exercises, weightlifting activities are used to build more muscle and strength; however, there are plenty of ways you can increase the intensity of these types of exercises as well. Try:


Alternate between upper and lower body parts between each set, or pause to do some jumping jacks.
An easy way to increase the intensity of a weightlifting routine is by doing more sets or adding more reps per set.Another way to increase the intensity of your exercises is by taking longer when you're lowering a weight (for example, when you're lowering your arms back to the starting position after a bicep curl). This helps draw out the exercise and how long your muscles are working., If you're interested in just choosing a higher intensity workout or incorporating more high-intensity exercises to your workout routine, consider doing one or two HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts a week.


HIIT is a specific type of training that focuses on working you up to very high intensities.Typical HIIT workouts are short in length and alternate between short bursts of very, very high-intensity exercises with short ""rest"" periods of moderate-intensity exercises.HIIT workouts burn more calories from fat and push your body into the anaerobic zone which helps you improve speed and endurance.HIIT workouts can be done with any exercise — running, cycling or swimming. For example, alternate between one minute full sprint with three minutes of a moderate jog. Repeat this cycle a few times or until you cannot continue.

, Both cardio and strength training routines are made more difficult when you combine them. Both have unique training benefits and, when paired together, can increase the intensity of your workouts.


Cardio intensity can be boosted by adding exercises like lunges, push-ups or squats. And strength training routines can be made more difficult by adding in jumping jacks or knee raises in between sets.
Combining these two types of exercises helps increase metabolism and keeps your heart rate elevated during exercise and after the exercise has been completed.This can result in increased calorie burn and helps build more muscle mass., A way to increase the intensity of both weightlifting and cardio routines is to include some explosive movements and work until ""muscle failure.""


Explosive movements are those like box jumps or Olympic lifts. These moves engage more of your muscle fibers, which can increase strength and endurance.Only add more explosive moves to one to two days of your workout routine. This helps prevent injury.
Work to ""muscle failure."" When you feel like you can't do another repetition or run a step further, force yourself to go a little further or do another rep at a lower intensity. This helps increase how hard your muscles work., Before starting any new workout or increasing the intensity or difficulty of your exercise routine, make sure you consult your doctor.


Your doctor will be able to tell you whether increasing intensity or difficulty is safe and appropriate for you.
Some higher-intensity exercises may not be appropriate for everyone at every fitness level. Discuss this with your physician.
It is normal to experience some discomfort or shortness of breath when increasing the intensity of your workout, but it's important you listen to your body and always keep your exercise intensity within a safe zone. Overdoing any activity can be harmful, and you need to be realistic and aware of your own limits.

, When you're trying to increase the intensity of your workout, there's most likely a goal behind this desire. You might want to run faster, lift more weight or cycle for a longer time. Make an exercise calendar to help you. Use a physical calendar you can write on or your smartphone or an app to help.


It's important to go slowly when first increasing the intensity and difficulty of your exercise. You can cause injury quickly if you do not proceed slowly and with caution.
Lay out a calendar for your exercise routine. Note what you're doing each week and how you're increasing the intensity by small increments each week.
Also note if you have an event, race or competition coming up. If you want to increase your pace over the course of six months before your next 10K race, it's important to plan your weekly workouts and how you're going to gradually increase the intensity.

, When you're trying to increase the intensity of your workouts, you should get familiar with tracking your heart rate and perceived exertion so you can monitor your intensity during any workout.


RPE is a scale that allows you to assess your level of exertion while exercising — by paying attention to how you feel, you can make sure your workout is safe but challenging. The scale is as follows:1: Very light exertion — Hardly any activity, but not sleeping
2 – 3: Light activity — Easy to maintain your pace and you can breathe normally. You can easily carry on a conversation.
4 – 6: Moderate activity — Noticeably more challenging. Breathing heavily, can only hold a short conversation.
7 – 8: Vigorous activity — You can only speak about one sentence. Shortness of breath, and on the verge of uncomfortable.
9: Very hard activity — Very challenging and difficult to keep up this intensity. Hard to breathe and you can only speak a word or two.
10: Maximum effort activity — Feels almost impossible; you can only do the activity for a few seconds at this intensity and you cannot even get a word out.


Track your RPE during one of your typical workouts. For example, you estimate your morning jogs to be at a five or six. Aim to increase your exertion by one or two points — jog at a seven or eight on the scale.
You can also track your heart rate. Your target heart rate is based on your age and encompasses a range of heart rates that are safe and will give you the best results. You can find charts or calculators online to give you an idea of what your target heart rate should be during exercise.
Working on the upper end of your target heart rate range means you're working out at a moderate- to high-intensity.

, Although increased intensity of physical activity is associated with many benefits, doing too much or going too hard can be dangerous.Some studies showed that continued high-intensity exercise may lead to more heart problems long-term.It's beneficial to do high intensity exercises, but alternate them with low or moderate intensity activities as well.
If you notice any acute pain in your joints, muscles or chest after doing high intensity exercise, discontinue immediately.
If you're feeling sore or have muscle fatigue, make sure to take a day of rest before starting another workout.

Assess her mood and body language signals.,
Watch what she does with her eyes.,
Look for clues in her fashion sense.",How to Tell if Another Woman is Bisexual3," Recognize that men are often more overt about expressing their interest in someone romantically. Women often hint.What’s her mood like when she sees you? If she becomes giddy, extra happy to see you, and full of smiles, that’s a good sign. Does she ever show jealousy? If she shows jealousy, such as when you spend time with another friend, that could be a sign she’s interested.
Is she trying to get you alone or does she only hang out with you when other friends are along? If she’s always trying to get you alone, it might mean she wants to hook up with you.
Does she have open body language (body facing toward the woman, palms up, feet pointing toward the woman) or closed (arms crossed over her chest, palms down, body facing away, etc.)

, If you catch her making eye contact with you (you’re a woman interested in her) or if you catch her making eye contact with another woman (if you’re a guy or a female friend of hers), she may be bisexual.


Persistent eye contact can be a way of creating intimate connection and to flirt. Also, you should pay attention to the amount of personal space she leaves between herself and other women. Is she trying to create a zone of intimacy?Looking someone in the eyes and then glancing away is a sign of flirtation in many cases. People don’t usually lock eyes with people they only consider friends., Avoid stereotyping people. That being said, sometimes you can pick up clues from how she dresses her body.If she goes for an androgynous look, or something like a suit-and tie combo, she might have a bisexual vibe. Other clothing that might provide a clue would be low-slung pants, Calvin Klein briefs, and trendy fitted blazers.
Keep an eye out for rainbow accessories or pins that show she’s out. Some hairstyles are more associated with being a lesbian than others, such as a barber’s cut or military cut. Short fingernails could also be a giveaway. However, absolutely none of these clues is surefire. There are many bisexual women who dress differently. It’s all individual.

You can choose whatever type feels best to you.Whatever material or level of firmness you choose, your mattress should feel supportive but comfortable so that you wake up feeling rested.


If you feel stiff or have aches upon waking, it can be a sign that a different mattress would help you sleep better.
Look for a mattress that provides adequate support for your back and neck in particular.Cover your mattress with whatever sheets and bedding you find comfortable. Change them in different seasons so that you stay warm or cool as needed.
Most mattresses last about eight years, so think about replacing yours if it is old and uncomfortable.
If your mattress is uncomfortable and you cannot replace it, you can make things better by using pillows properly.;
, Select a pillow that feels comfortable to you, no matter whether it is soft or firm.You can also use several pillows if you like, but make sure that they do not push your head up at a sharp angle. Whatever position you sleep in, your pillow(s) should keep your head held supported between your shoulders—in the same position it would be in if you were standing up., Make sure to wash your bedding as frequently as you are able to, and any time it becomes especially dirty.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for washing your sheets.
If you have a mattress cover, wash it in hot water.
You can dust your mattress with baking soda, then vacuum it up a day later. This will draw out moisture.
Pillows can be washed or put in your dryer at a high temperature to clean them and kill dust mites.

, Also, make sure your bedroom itself is as clean and orderly as possible. Some evidence shows that a clean and orderly bed and bedroom can help you sleep more comfortably, perhaps because of a psychological effect., A cool room (around 65 degrees Fahrenheit) is best for getting comfortable, sound sleep because it conforms to your body’s natural temperature fluctuations.Use a thermostat, fan, or window to help cool the air in your room if it is too hot/cool for comfortable sleep.

, Choose comfortable clothes to sleep in. Loose-fitting clothes that are cool in warm seasons and warm in cool seasons will feel best. If you are too warm, remove clothing or bedding. If you are too cold, add a layer of clothing or bedding.

, Most people sleep best when their environment is quiet and free from distractions.


Keep televisions, radios, and other devices turned off or at a low volume.
Keep windows closed if outside noise such as traffic disturbs you.
Some people find it helpful to use aids to lessen outside distractions, like ear plugs or the white noise of a small fan.

, If you are having trouble sleeping comfortably, you might benefit from trying a different position. Sleep positions normally fall into one of three categories: back, side or stomach.Sleeping on your side is most recommended for comfort and to reduce the chances of interrupting your sleep.


When sleeping on your side, bend your knees slightly toward your chest (similar to the “fetal position”).
If you have back trouble, consider placing a pillow between your knees. This alleviates pressure on your hips and lower back, making sleep more comfortable.

, However, sleeping on your back may increase your chances of lower back pain. Doing so may also cause cases of apnea, which can interrupt your sleep.If you do choose to sleep on your back, try placing a rolled up towel or pillow under your knees to encourage the natural curve of your spine.

, Some feel that sleeping on the stomach is most comfortable. However, doing so can cause pain in the lower back and neck. Sleeping on your stomach may also cause you to toss and turn in discomfort.If you sleep on your stomach, use a soft pillow or none at all to reduce the risk of causing neck pain.
If you have underlying sleep problems, it is generally recommended that you do not sleep on your stomach.

, If you trying to go to sleep soundly, avoid coffee and other caffeinated products, nicotine, and other stimulants. Their effects can last for hours, making it hard to go to sleep comfortably.And while depressants like alcohol can initially make you feel sleepy, they can actually disturb your sleep., The food and drink you consume, and when you have it, can impact your sleep.Large meals shortly before bedtime can cause indigestion.Your last meal should be no less than 2 or 3 hours before your bedtime.Small, healthy snacks make the best choices if you need something before sleep., Your body naturally responds to lighting conditions and will adjust sleep accordingly. This means that getting plenty of light in the morning and during the day, then keeping the lights dim at night will help you sleep soundly.Wearing sunglasses later in the day dims light, which can help you become sleepy.Avoid making television, computers, tablets, smartphones and similar devices part of your pre-sleep routine, as the light from electronic screens disrupts the body’s inclination to sleep.Moreover, some research suggests that the distractions of screen-time interaction have a similar effect., Getting regular physical activity is good for your health and may help you sleep at night. Exercise has a stimulating effect, however, so if you exercise too close to your bedtime, you may have trouble falling asleep or sleeping soundly.Exercise no later than two or three hours before your bedtime. However, light stretching can be helpful and relaxing right before you go to sleep.

, Naps can help if you are tired, but you should avoid long naps (longer than a half-hour), and naps near your bedtime. Otherwise, you may have trouble sleeping comfortably.For best results, if you are trying to sleep comfortably at night, avoid naps after 3 p.m., If you get yourself used to falling asleep and waking up on a regular schedule, you will sleep better overall.Be especially aware of when you're waking up and going to sleep during weekends and holidays. Try to stay within 1-2 hours of your normal bedtime. Fixing your sleep schedule can take some time and persistence, but you will sleep more comfortably once you do.

, Get your body and mind ready for sleep by doing the same things each night before you go to sleep.Do whatever relaxes you: read a book, take a bath or shower, listen to relaxing music, etc.


Your pre-sleep routine could incorporate a bath, reading a book, relaxing music, and other things that help you unwind.Many people find that warm drinks or tea can help them become comfortable and sleepy (just stay away from caffeinated beverages). Chamomile tea is a good choice because it has a calming effect.Meditation and/or breathing exercises are also recognized as calming techniques.A simple breathing exercise is to inhale for a count of 3 or 4, then exhale for a count of six or eight.A few repetitions of this can be very helpful when trying to calm down and prepare for a good night's sleep.

, If you don’t fall asleep after fifteen minutes, do something else. If you are trying to fall asleep and still haven’t after a quarter of an hour, get up and do something that relaxes you until you feel tired again.Tossing and turning while you’re not tired or have something on your mind will not get you to sleep.


Many busy people find they have a ""to do"" list that keeps them from falling asleep. To combat this, keep a notepad next to your bed and jot your thoughts or ideas down, so you no longer worry about them and can rest.

, If you have tried to make your sleep more comfortable and can’t, feel constantly fatigued, or have other concerns about your sleep, seek expert medical advice.If you have any of the following symptoms, you should also seek help:


Excessive or loud snoring
Feeling tired after 8 hours of sleep
Symptoms that occur only at night, such as a cough, sore throat, or heart burn

Take note of where the scene takes place, both in terms of the place and the time.",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film2," In particular, note when the scene occurs within the timeline of the movie and whether the scene depicts events out of order.


Many movies have scenes that occur out of order, such as when the character is remembering or relaying events that happened at another time (a flashback) or because the director has made the creative choice to show events out of order. Usually, even though the events are out of order, the story itself is told in a straightforward manner from the first scene to the last scene.
As it relates to the story, ask yourself why the scene is taking place where it is and whether it helps to tell the story or distracts from it.
The setting may have been chosen by the director for reasons other than telling the story. Try to determine if the setting is important to the story or just interesting to the director.

If you plan to meet at the party, you might be stranded alone at the party for an hour or more.Be aware that if you bring an outgoing friend, they may want to be more social than you want to be. On the other hand, if you opt for someone who's less outgoing than you are, you may be tempted to hide out in a corner together and not socialize with other people.;
, Don’t be shy and knock on the door. Once you’re in the party, make sure to greet the host, if there is a clear host. Near the beginning of arriving at a house party, you should scan the rooms and see if you recognize anyone. Go through each room and scout the area for any friends or acquaintances you have.


Introduce yourself by saying, ""Hi, my name is Jill. How's it going?"" Just be yourself and people will respond positively.
If you are not close with someone, but you’ve chatted before, this is a good person to talk to. Try not to interrupt anyone who’s engaged in a conversation.
If none of your friends have arrived, try to play it cool by not seeming too desperate for conversation or attention. One way teens cope with this awkwardness is by smoking, but you should skip smoking. It's bad for your health, and you could start a bad habit that could last for years. Instead, check your cell phone for articles to read., Don’t feel embarrassed if you don’t know anyone at the party. Scan the party for somebody who doesn’t seem too preoccupied by a conversation. By finding someone who is free and seems to be in a similar situation, you have an opportunity to create a conversation. Once you create an interesting conversation, other partygoers might notice you.


Start simply by introducing yourself and tell this person how you recognize them. Then you can move into a discussion on the mutual topic that connects you.You can spice up the conversation by asking questions about their past. You can ask questions like: “Have you ever lived somewhere else?,” or “What did you do last weekend?”

, One of the easiest ways to socialize at a house party is to hang out with your friends. This is a good strategy because other partygoers will frequently enter your circle of friends. When other people come into your circle of friends, you can introduce yourself.


Follow your friend group, but don’t feel inclined to follow them throughout the entire night. A fun thing to do at house parties is to venture off alone.

, Sometimes it can be helpful to make it your goal to get somebody's phone number. Many people do this for dating purposes, but you can also make the same goal for gaining a friend. Once you meet somebody, keep asking questions until you both realize you enjoy each other's company.


Socializing doesn't come easily for everyone and that is fine. Making goals can sometimes improve your ability to socialize.
One way of getting somebody's phone number is by asking them if they'd like to hang out a different time. You could say, ""Hey, do you want to go to the Cubs game with me?""

Get a transparent glass ""pebble"" or ""gem"".,

Get a photo a section of which can be cut out to be seen through the pebble.,

Lay the glass pebble on the photo, flat side down, to see that it fits over a part you'd like to use for this craft.,

Trace around the pebble and cut out the picture.,

Before you glue your picture on, look at the picture.,

Put a pea-sized blob of glue that dries clear on the flat side of the pebble.,

Put the picture face-down on top of the pebble and press down.,

Turn over the pebble so its weight is on the picture.
,

Put the pebble on a surface it won't stick to so that it can dry.,

Say voila!",How to Make a Picture Pebble," These are blobs of glass flat on one side and curved on the other, often sold for houseplant decorating and floral arranging. Some are pretty big, up to two inches wide. Bigger is better, within reason.
, A small print from a digital photo is perfect. Don't use an old, big or otherwise hard to replace photo!, For instance, a friend's face., Cut inside the line, so the picture will not stick out past the edge of the pebble., When you look in it it's magnified., Use a glue that dries clear, such as Elmer's (which is nontoxic, too), or silicone (which is stronger and dries faster)., Squeeze the glue out thin. The glue will spread on the whole picture.,, A ceramic plate would be good. Let it dry for a few days. If it looks milky, it's not dry., One magnified picture pebble. ENJOY!"

Shorten your stirrups and reins.,
Assume the 3-point position.,
Grasp a handful of mane.,
Straighten your back.,
Keep your feet in line with your back.,
Direct your horse forward with your legs.,
Steer with your legs.,
Move back to three-point when necessary.",How to Ride in 2 Point Position," If your stirrups are too long, maintaining the 2-point position will be exhausting. Since 2-point is used primarily for jumping and the hand gallop, you'll want a slightly shorter stirrup. Shorten the reins as well to retain contact with the horse's mouth.;
, This is your ""normal"" riding position, with both legs and seat fully on the horse. Sink as much weight into your heels as possible. Do not continue until you feel stable and comfortable.

, Take a handful of mane in one hand, about a handspan in front of the pommel (5–6 inches / 13–15cm).


This step helps you balance. It is not preferred to hold onto any parts of the tack because if the tack falls off you will probably fall off too.

, Push your rear and hips upward, slightly above the saddle. This motion will also help you straighten your back, aligning your heels, hips, and shoulders. Your center of balance should be slightly forward of where it was in 3-point. Steady yourself on the horse's neck until you find your balance point.


Resist the impulse to squeeze your knees as you lift yourself up.

, Your ankles should be under your hips. If your feet are too far back, you may fall forward. If your feet are too far forward, you may fall back.

Do not straighten your legs. Your knees should be bent forward, so they can flex along with the horse's motion.

, When you feel comfortably balanced, squeeze your horse forward with your legs. Congratulations! You are now riding in a correct, clean 2-point position.

, If you want to go left, press against the horse with your right leg and ""open the door"" with your left hand, loosening the reins on that side and pulling outward. To direct the horse right, use the mirror image of these motions.


Do not steer with the reins except for the motion described. Pulling against the reins too hard may cause you to lose your balance. Use your leg to guide the horse.

, You'll probably start feeling uncomfortable or sore quickly the first few times you try this. If you ever feel like you're about to lose your balance, or if you're having trouble directing the horse, return to three-point position. Once you've readjusted your seating or handled a difficult situation, you can return to the two-point position."

If you have diabetes, ask if you can take insulin or oral blood sugar medications before the test.Tell your doctor if you have a history of asthma, kidney or bleeding problems. Special precautions may be needed if you have one of these conditions.
You may be asked not to take aspirin (including other products that contain aspirin) or prescription blood thinners for several days before the test. Discuss with your doctor when you can resume these medications.;
, Pregnant women need to be cautious about doing certain things to avoid harming the fetus. If you are or might be pregnant, or if you just had a baby, discuss these details with your doctor so that you can decide on the best course of action.It is extremely important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant because an angiogram is needed to detect a potential coronary artery blockage. This may result in the need for reperfusion stenting to restore blood flow to the heart.
Use formula for one to two days after your angiogram if you are breast-feeding until the dye has passed through your body.

, Your doctor will determine what testing you need to undergo before your angiogram. Make sure you follow your doctor’s directions and complete any recommended testing.You may need to have blood taken or an electrocardiogram done before the angiogram.

, Iodine dye is usually used in the cardiac catheterization test. Your doctor will need to know if you possess such an allergy so you can explore other treatment options.Other possible dyes can cause a reaction in those allergic to shellfish.

, Most angiograms are planned for the morning hours, so this shouldn’t be a huge inconvenience. But it is an important part of preparing for your angiogram.If your test is scheduled for later in the day, do not consume any food or drink for 4-8 hours before the test.

, In the hours preceding your procedure, especially the 24 hours ahead of time, you should avoid alcohol and tobacco products. These can inhibit your behavior, alter test results, and cause other complications during the procedure.If you are given a sedative during the procedure, this could intensify the effects of any alcohol in your system.

, It is important to tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including prescription, over-the-counter, herbs, and supplements. Bring them in their original bottles. This will help you remember to tell the doctor about the medications you are on.Remember to also notify the doctor about any medications you might be allergic to.

, Even though the angiogram is a simple procedure, you will need to come to the hospital ready for a surgery. Some ways to prepare yourself include:Following your doctor’s instructions on what to eat/drink in the 24 hours leading up to your procedure, which may include not eating or drinking anything in the six to eight hours leading up to your procedure.
Removing your contact lenses, eyeglasses, hair clips, nail polish, and jewelry before the test (leave your jewelry at home, if possible).
Emptying your bladder before the test because it can take several hours.

, At the hospital you’ll need to check in and meet with your medical team to discuss exactly what will happen during the procedure so that you feel prepared. They will let you know about any possible complications or risks.


You’ll be taken to a room where you can change into a hospital gown before the procedure begins.

, After most angiograms, patients stay at the facility for 4-6 hours after the procedure. This is so that the staff can observe you and make sure there are no postoperative complications.During this time, try to relax. Don’t let yourself stress about the results. Just enjoy taking a break while the doctors are there to watch you.

, You may be given a sedative during the angiogram procedure or immediately before it. This sedative will impair your ability to function and to operate a motor vehicle.


You’ll need someone to give you a ride home and help you get settled in after your procedure. Try to find someone you trust who can stay with you for a couple hours (preferably overnight) after you get home in case you need help with anything.
Most medical facilities will refuse to perform an angiogram on you if you do not have a responsible adult with you who has agreed to take you home.

, One of the best ways to help your body recover from any kind of procedure is to get as much rest as possible. This will help your body heal and avoid any potential complications. After the procedure, you’ll probably feel a little discomfort in your groin area. Bed rest will help you avoid moving that area so it can heal properly.


You should probably plan on staying home for a few days after the procedure to help you take it easy.

, Talk to your doctor about any questions or other concerns about the procedure. Tell them how you’re feeling and about any problems you may have encountered.


Ask your doctor about the outcome of the test and what the results mean for you moving forward. Are more tests required? Do you need an operation? Should you change some aspect of your lifestyle?

Pay your initial fees.",How to Sign a Timeshare Contract," Before you decide to buy a timeshare, you should have a good idea of how far in advance you're comfortable planning your vacations and what you enjoy.A timeshare tends to be a better option for families accustomed to planning their vacations well in advance. Regardless of the type of timeshare you choose, there will be stiff competition to book time during the prime vacation months.
If your idea of an ideal vacation is a week at the beach, and you don't care about exploring different places or having adventures, a timeshare can easily fit those desires and expectations.
Keep in mind that a timeshare is an investment in your future vacations and the time you'll spend with your family – not a real estate investment. Accordingly, the timeshare you buy should reflect the type of vacation you and your family will enjoy for years to come.;
, A prioritized list of your desires in a vacation property can help you compare available units.


For example, you may enjoy spending your days at the beach and not care about any other amenities, or you may prefer to stay at a resort with a spa, fitness center, and other amenities such as pools and tennis courts.
If you plan on vacationing with your family, keep in mind the things others like to do on vacation. Children, for example, may prefer a location with playgrounds or other activities designed for them.
You also should consider whether you prefer a property that is in close proximity to restaurants and shops, or whether you want the seclusion and peacefulness of something more off the beaten path.
Don't neglect the characteristics of the unit itself, in terms of the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you want, its overall layout, and features.
For example, if you know most of your vacations will be working vacations in which you'll have to spend some time checking in with your office or working for clients, you may need something with a private or secluded workspace and available Wi-Fi.

, With a deeded timeshare, you actually own a portion of the property and are responsible for the mortgage.Whether a deeded timeshare is right for you depends to some extent on how you plan to spend your vacation time in the coming years. If you like to go to a different place every year, you may want to look at an exchange system rather than a traditional deeded timeshare in which you're basically locked in to a week at the same place.
On the other hand, if you have always imagined having a vacation home, and prefer to spend your vacation in a relatively familiar spot where you can relax, a deeded timeshare can provide you with the comfort and consistency of knowing what to expect.
As a practical matter, there's not much difference between a deeded or a non-deeded timeshare, except that deeded timeshares can be more difficult to sell or transfer once you decide you no longer want the property.

, Depending on what you want out of your timeshare property, a points-based plan or floating time system may be a better option for you.For example, exchange companies such as RCI or Intervals International allow you to easily swap a week at your ""home"" property for a week in one of the other properties affiliated with the company.
Keep in mind that to keep the same rate you typically must book your vacation at a unit of the same size as the one you purchased, in a location with similar amenities, and during a similar time of year.
For example, if you bought a week during peak months, you typically must exchange it for another peak week – although keep in mind the time of year that is considered ""peak season"" may differ depending on the location of the resort and the amenities it offers. Peak season for a ski resort might be the winter months, while a beach property's peak would be in the summer.
Another option is to buy into a point system, in which what you're actually purchasing is a set number of points that you can redeem for accommodations or sell to other time-sharers.
A point system may be a better option if you prefer the flexibility to vacation in multiple places, or if you don't always plan your vacation at the same time every year.

, Although the specifics vary among companies, to buy a timeshare you must meet the company's age and income requirements.Some timeshare companies may be restricted to retirees and older couples, while others are geared towards young families.
All timeshare companies have minimum income requirements, and may run a credit check before they consider your application.

, Even if you've decided on an exchange program or a points system, you still want to visit the property and evaluate its maintenance and operations.Take a tour of the property and pay attention to the upkeep of the resort as a whole and its amenities.
You also should tour one or more units, even if you're not staying there during your visit. Evaluate the general upkeep and cleanliness of the unit just as you'd evaluate such things if you were renting an apartment or purchasing a home.
You also should feel comfortable with the staff of the resort and the management. If you have any problems during your stay, you'll have to work with them.
Ask for information regarding the property's ownership and financial history, including the property's maintenance budget. You should research the track record for both the developer and the management company to make sure they're legitimate and have experience with vacation properties.

, Make sure you understand your ownership rights and responsibilities as laid out in the timeshare agreement.Take care not to confuse marketing terms with standard legal definitions. When you're trying to understand your agreement, you should be more concerned with your benefits and obligations under the contract than what the timeshare company calls something.
If you see terms you don't understand, ask the timeshare representative to explain to you what they mean.
If the contract as a whole seems confusing, you may want to have a licensed real estate attorney give it a look and explain it to you. Don't let the timeshare representative rush you into signing an agreement you don't fully understand.

, If it isn't included in the agreement, ask for an itemized list of the fees and other expenses you'll be required to pay each year for your timeshare.Almost all timeshares include monthly or yearly maintenance fees, and also may include homeowners' fees, rental fees, trading fees, or property taxes. In general, you should expect these fees to be somewhere between $500 and $700 each year.Some of these fees won't necessarily be mentioned in the sales presentation for the timeshare, but will be included in your contract. This is why it's important to read that contract carefully and make sure you know what you're getting into.
Although many timeshare companies require annual fees be paid in a single lump-sum payment, some companies offer financing through which you would pay a portion of the fees each month. Check with your timeshare company to find out what financing options are available to you., Once you have a breakdown of the annual costs, fit those amounts into your budget and make sure you and your family can afford the timeshare.Don't forget to include the cost of traveling to your destination, as well as any other expenses. For example, if your timeshare is only a three-hour drive from your house, your travel expenses might not be that big of a deal. It's a different story, however, if you have to fly cross country to get to your timeshare property, then rent a car once you get there.

, When you sign the agreement you typically must pay a significant amount in deposits and fees up front.Typically you'll be required to pay a deposit up front, as well as your first year's maintenance fees.
If you've signed on with an exchange or points program, you also may have to pay membership fees or dues to join that club.

, Look at the 'New' and 'Hot' list and try to make your outfit a bit different. Make sure you plan it. For example, a popular look is Doc Martins, shorts, knee-highs and a shirt. You could change it to a completely casual upper-top, then some smart heels or brogues to make it that bit unique.

, It could be in a beautiful forest, in front of an old cottage etc. Don't have people walking in the background. If you can't go anywhere quiet to do your shoot, then do it in your own home, against a plainly coloured wall. It is good if you have a friend to shoot your looks, or a tripod and self-timer on your camera.

, Try different poses but try to make sure your feet/ shoes are in the picture. Lots of Look bookers only hype if the shoes are shown. Try a collage look, and have your shoes in a separate photo if you can't have a head-to-toe photo. Make sure it goes by the rules too. Only edit your photo if you really have to, but it is best if you don't so you can see the colours properly.

, A good time for this is midday to evening time. As there are people from all over the world on it, it will get seen by someone. Also try to have a good, interesting title and add a descriptive piece on why you chose the outfit or what made you choose it.

, Don't worry if you don't get any hypes within the first few minutes. It will take time to get popular. Just keep trying. Good Luck :)

Wait for a rainy fall day.,
Watch your step.,
Look on the ground.",How to Find Worms1," You can find worms at any time, but it will be easiest when it's just rained. The water drives the worms out of the ground into the open air. They'll head for dry land: sidewalks, roads, driveways, and patios.Look for worms on a humid day before it rains, or during a rain-shower. Try hunting on a cool and moist autumn day or evening.


If you are trying to sample worms for a study, fall is the best time to start looking. Most worms are sexually mature by the time fall rolls around, which makes it easier to tell them apart.
If it isn't a rainy season, consider watering the ground where you suspect there are worms. Make sure that the earth is thoroughly saturated. Then, wait a few hours and wait for the worms to come out – ideally, in the evening.;
, Walk delicately, and try to be patient. Worms can feel the vibration of your footsteps through the soil, and the concussive effect may drive them further underground. If there are a lot of worms out, make sure that you don't accidentally crush them under your feet!

, Check garden soil, fields, pastures, lawns, parks – anywhere with loose soil. Look under rocks, logs, and other objects that create shelter in the soil. Don't be afraid to dig deeper if you suspect that there are worms about.


Check your footprints. The pressure from your footstep will often bring curious worms to the surface."

Pick a clematis cultivar.,

Keep clematis well watered.,
Provide a support for the clematis.,
Fertilize the clematis.,
Prune dead or damaged stems at any time.,
Prune away the oldest stems.,
Perform annual pruning according to the cultivar's requirements.",How to Plant Clematis," Clematis flowers come in an enormous range of shapes and colors, from pink blooms that span 6 inches across to drooping blue bells to starry white flowers. They've grown in popularity in recent years, so many nurseries offer dozens of varieties to choose from. When you decide which cultivar to buy, take the color, shape, potential side and sun requirements into account. Clematis often take several years to flower, so look for a potted plant that's already a year or two old. Here are the most common clematis cultivars:Nelly Moser: Has large, pink flowers and is one of the most common types of clematis. It's hardy and easy to establish.

Ernest Markham: Has stunning magenta flowers and grows vigorously on trellises and arbors.

Niobe: Has red flowers and is a suitable choice for growing in a pot, since it doesn't get very large.

Princess Diana: Has pale pink, bell-shaped flowers and does particularly well in very hot climates.

Jackmanii: Has deep purple blooms and grows vigorously; a widely available favorite.

Venosa Violacea: Has abundant blue-violet blooms.

Apple Blossom: Has small white blooms; grows as an evergreen.;
, Clematis may come in an amazing range of shapes and sizes, but they have similar needs when it comes to sun and temperature. They are hardy plants that require at least 6 hours of full sun per day.Clematis are hardy from growing zone 3 to zone 9.A few varieties of clematis will grow in partial shade, but they won't reach their full potential unless they have full sun for 6 hours per day.
Look for a spot with low-growing perennials and groundcover that will shade the roots of the clematis but allow it to grow into full sun about 3 or 4 inches off of the ground. Clematis need cool roots and full sun on the vine and flowers. If you can't find a spot with groundcover, you can plant it later or mulch around the clematis to keep the roots cool.
You can also plant clematis near the base of a shrub or small tree. The clematis will grow up the branches without harming the ""companion"" shrub or tree., The location shouldn't be so dry that it doesn't retain moisture, but it should drain well enough that standing water doesn't sit around the roots of the clematis. To test whether the soil in an area drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water drains immediately, the soil is on the sandy side. If the water stands in the hole, the soil has too much clay, and doesn't drain fast enough. If the water slowly but steadily seeps into the soil, it's just right for clematis.

, Clematis prefer the soil to be neutral or alkaline over acidic. If you conduct a test and determine that the pH is a little too acidic, sweeten the soil by mixing in limestone or wood ash., Dig a hole several inches deeper than the pot the clematis came in, so that when you plant it the soil comes right up to the first set of leaves. Before you plant the clematis, amend the soil by working in compost and granular organic fertilizer.This will ensure that the plant has enough nutrients to establish itself in the first few months after planting.


If you're working with soil that tends to be clay heavy (slow to drain), dig the hole a few inches deeper than you normally would. If your soil is sandy (quick to drain), a slightly shallower hole will be better for the plant's roots, so they're close enough to the surface to get plenty of water., Very gently remove the clematis from the pot it came in, taking care not to rip or break the fragile roots and shoots. Set the root ball into the hole and pat the soil around its base stem. The soil should come up to the first set of leaves; if it doesn't, lift out the root ball and dig the hole a bit deeper. Leave the stake in place so that the young clematis has something to grow against for the first year.

, Place 4 inches of straw or another type of mulch around the base of the clematis to keep the roots cool. You can also plant or encourage the growth of low-growing perennials whose leaves will shade the roots of the clematis throughout the summer., Give the clematis long, deep drinks of water whenever the soil seems dry. To test whether it is dry, stick your finger in the soil, then pull it out. If you didn't hit wet soil, it's time to water the clematis.


Don't water the clematis too often, though; since the roots are shaded, water may tend to sit for a longer period of time before it evaporates.
Water in the morning, rather than in the evening, so that the water has time to dry and be absorbed before night falls.

, Clematis will not grow unless they have a vertical structure to climb. During the first year, the support that came with the clematis will be sufficient for the plant's needs, but after that you'll need to provide a larger support, like a trellis or arbor, to encourage it to grow bigger.


Clematis grows by twisting its leaf stems around slender supports like twine, fishing line, thin branches, or screens. Be sure the support you provide isn't too wide for the leaf stems to reach around. It should be less than .5 inches (1.27 centimeters) in diameter.
If you have a trellis or arbor made with wide pieces of wood, line it with a screen or attach some fishing line to provide a support thin enough for the clematis to wrap around.
As the clematis grows larger and reaches around the support, you can help it stay in place by ""trussing"" it: loosely tying it to to the structure with fishing line., Every 4 to 6 weeks, feed the clematis with 10-10-10 fertilizer or side dress it with compost by spreading it around the plant's base. Clematis requires plenty of nutrients to grow strong and produce abundant flowers., While clematis aren't prone to being affected by pests, they can get a fungal disease that can cause the entire plant to turn black and die. If you see a dead or wilting stem on the clematis, use a clean pair of pruning shears to trim it away at the base. Disinfect the shears in a bleach solution between cuts so you don't spread the disease to other parts of the plant.

, Since flowering becomes less abundant on stems over 4 years old, you can cut off the oldest stems to encourage new ones to grow. Wait until after the first bloom of the season, then use a pair of clean pruning shears to remove the stems at the base stem., Clematis does well with an annual pruning to encourage fresh growth. However, different cultivars require pruning at different times of year. It's important to know exactly when to prune your specific cultivar, since you can damage the plant if you prune it at the wrong time of year.



Plants that bloom on old wood, meaning the flowers appear on last year's stems, require no pruning except to cut back their size a bit and keep them contained. After they flower, prune back to a pair of healthy buds. (Apple Blossom is in this group.)

Plants that bloom first on old wood and again on new wood, meaning the flowers appear on last year's stems and new spring stems, need to be pruned to remove weak growth. Prune them in early spring, before they bloom, to remove weaker stems, then again after they bloom to improve their shape. (Nelly Moser and Ernest Markham are in this group.)

Plants that bloom on new wood, meaning the flowers appear only on new spring stems, should be cut back to 12 inches at the beginning of spring. (This includes Niobe, Princess Diana, Jackmanii, and Venosa Violacea.)

, You'll need one cable to connect the modem to the router, and another to connect the router to your computer during setup. after setup, you can connect your computer wirelessly if it has a wireless network adapter. Your router or modem may have come with an Ethernet cable. If your computer was previously connected directly to the modem, you can use that Ethernet cable.

, This is the Ethernet port closes to the power connector on the back of the router. It has a different color than the four LAN ports. Leave the router's power supply unplugged for the moment.

, You can usually find your computer's Ethernet port along the back. Some laptops may not have an Ethernet port, but nearly every desktop computer should have one.

, Turn the modem's power back on or plug it back in. Wait about 30-60 seconds for the modem to boot up.

, Connect the router's power supply on the back and plug it into the wall. It will take about 30 seconds to boot up.

, If your computer isn't turned on, turn it on now. Make sure that you aren't connected to any other networks, such as another wireless network.

, You should see the Power light, the WAN light, and the LAN light for the LAN port your computer is connected to.


If you don't see the WAN light, make sure that your modem is powered on and connected to the WAN port on the router.
If you don't see the LAN light, make sure that your computer is connected via Ethernet to one of the LAN ports on the router, and that it is turned on.

, You can configure your router using any web browser on the computer that's connected to the router.

, When you load this address, you should be prompted for your router login information. This is the default address for the D-Link WBR-2310 wireless router.


If this doesn't load the router's configuration page, check that your computer is just connected to the router and not to another network as well.
If you still can't load the configuration page, the router was likely used by someone else and the default address was changed. Press and hold the Reset button on the back of the router for about ten seconds. This will reset the router to its default settings. Once the router resets, you should be able to access the configuration page at 192.168.0.1.

, This is the default login information for your router. If this login information doesn't work, it means that someone else has changed the login details. you can reset the router by pressing and holding the Reset button on the back for about ten seconds. After resetting, you should be able to login with the default login information., If you just want to get your router up and running, click the ""Setup Wizard"" button that appears when you log in for the first time. This will get your network configured and secured in just a few minutes. If you don't see the button, click the ""Setup"" tab.


If you're logging in to change your settings after already setting up the router, skip down to the Adjusting Settings section. You'll find details on how to find the settings you need.

, This will start the setup process for your router's internet connection and administrator account. Click ""Next"" to continue when prompted.

, Remember how there wasn't a password when you logged in for the first time? You don't want to keep it this way, especially if you are setting up a wireless network. Create a new administrator password when prompted, and make sure you write it down or commit it to memory. You'll have to reset your router if you forget your password.

, You'll need to indicate your current timezone for accurate logs and time-based router settings. Select the correct timezone from the drop-down menu.

, Most home users who connect via cable or DSL will select the first option (""DHCP Connection""). Contact your internet service provider if you are unsure.

, For most users, this field will already be filled. Only click this if the MAC Address field is empty. Most users can ignore the host name field unless specified by their ISP.

, Click the ""Connect"" button to save your settings. your router will reboot, which may take one to two minutes.

, Open your web browser and see if you can load web pages. It may take a few tries before the first web page loads. This is normal behavior. Once you've verified that web pages are loading, you can move on to creating your wireless network., Enter 192.168.0.1 into the browser window of a computer connected to the router via Ethernet. Enter in the password that you created in the previous section when prompted to log in. The User Name is still ""admin"".

, This will open the setup wizards.

, This will open a new page allowing you to setup your wireless network.

, This will turn on the wireless network once you save your settings.

, Give your network a name, but make sure that it doesn't include any personal information. This network name will be publicly visible.

, This is the most secure method of wireless transmission, and requires no extra effort on your part over the outdated WEP. A strong WPA2 password is virtually impossible to crack, while a WEP password can be cracked in less than thirty minutes.


Only select WPA or WEP if you have older devices that only support these protocols.

, Anyone that can connect to your wireless network can potentially cause some serious damage, especially if your devices are not secure. Make sure that you create a strong but memorable password. You'll be giving the password to guests, so you don't want it to be too unwieldy. See How to Create a Password You Can Remember for tips on creating a good password.

, Your wireless settings will be saved, and the wireless network will be enabled. This may take about thirty seconds to a minute. Once the router has saved the changes, you can connect your devices to the network wirelessly.

, Now that the wireless network is active, you can connect your devices to it. The process varies depending on the device, but generally you'll select your wireless name from the list of available networks and then enter the password you created. For most devices, this is all you need to do to connect to the wireless network.


For more detailed instructions on connecting devices to a wireless network, see How to Connect to a Wireless Internet Connection.

, If you need to change the settings for your wireless network, you can do so from the ""Wireless Settings"" section of the ""Setup"" tab. The basics are outlined in the section above, but you can also adjust the channel if you're getting a lot of interference, enable ""Extended Range Mode"", and more.

, If you need to setup port forwarding for a program on your computer, you can do so from the ""Port Forwarding"" section of the ""Advanced"" tab. When forwarding ports, you'll be creating ""rules"" for each application. Enter the IP address of the computer you are setting up port forwarding for, and then enter in the range of ports you want to open. For more details on forwarding ports, see How to Set Up Port Fowarding on a Router.

, You can setup your router to block access to specific sites. Open the ""Advanced"" tab in the router configuration page and select ""Website Filter"". Enter the websites that you want to block access to, and then enable the filter. Note that this will affect all devices on the network.

, If you are using your router to play console games, enabling Gaming Mode may improve your connection and allow you to find more matches. In the ""Advanced"" tab, select ""Advanced Network"". Check the ""Enable Gaming Mode"" box, and then save your changes. This will reroute gaming traffic to improve performance. It is recommended that you disable this when you are not gaming.

Assess the hazard.,
Assess the manager's condition.,
Consider your position and options.,
Recognize the dynamics.,
Publicize the SOB Syndrome.",How to Deal With an Abusive Boss With the SOB Syndrome," Many people are difficult to work for, but are not included in the scope of discussion. These people achieve excellent results while being difficult to work with; Dr. Michael DeBakey and Admiral Hyman Rickover are extreme examples of demanding bosses that achieve world-class results. If you cannot keep up with them, that is your problem. This topic examines the abusive, pointless, wasteful behavior by managers that harms the workers and the goals of the organization.;
, The worst cases of bullying behavior seem to originate within a narrow profile of easily recognizable managerial behavior, but only if you know what to look for. This type behavior is sometimes identified as the ""SOB Syndrome"". ""SOB boss"" symptoms include:


Expresses a very negative view of himself, referring explicitly to himself as ""a tough son-of-a-bitch"" or ""a tough little bastard"" when in fact he hardly gets tough, productive results. SOB yes, tough no. Female managers in the pattern may refer to themselves as a ""tough bitch"". This signature statement, ""I am a tough SOB,"" is a dead giveaway of the SOB personality, but is usually not spoken in the presence of upper management.
Acts respectfully toward upper management, and has all the requisite qualifications for his position: experience, education, certifications, etc.
Is abusive, dishonest, and erratic in dealing with subordinates. Subordinates see both sides of the SOB's personality and that is why subordinates may think the SOB is ""crazy,"" but upper management sees the SOB only at his best behavior and may consider him ""outstanding.""
The SOB's erratic behavior may include a lack of emotional control around subordinates, resulting in temper tantrums, profane outbursts, and occasional violence.

, If your abusive manager meets all the criteria of the SOB Syndrome, you are in a precarious position, subject to stress-related illnesses, termination, demotion, or transfer. You are advised to leave, if you are able. In fact, the SOB's situation is no less precarious. SOBs are known to suffer career and personality meltdowns, after they have done much damage to the organization and to the workers. The SOB targets his more capable subordinates because he finds them threatening to his position. The SOB manager presides over a very unhealthy working environment.

, The personality of the SOB creates a very sick workplace culture. An SOB should not be in a management position. SOB's conditions are infectious. When you have an SOB in charge of an organization, clusters of emotional illnesses, productivity problems, and high personnel turnover are the norm, at great expense to the organization.


These problems commonly disappear, or are re-located, with a change of managers or a change of jobs for the SOB manager.
While you can sympathize with the SOB's problems, that does not justify the damage he does to the workers and to the organization. Some SOBs are known to have been severely abused in childhood, and this may well be a factor in other SOB personalities; something surely disturbed the SOB's personality development.
The substance-abusing personality is a close parallel to the SOB personality, but the SOB is found more frequently and creates greater costs and damages. Substance abusers are subject to management and HR scrutiny, and the incidence of substance abuse constantly receives attention and correction. Both the bully boss and the SOB receive much attention, but little effort is made to correct their behavior. The SOB personality is not generally recognized as a medical or psychological problem. There is little effort to correct the SOB's behavior because management cannot identify the nature of the problem.

, The problem of the bully boss/SOB personality will be corrected when it is properly recognized, costs are acknowledged, and demand for correction is voiced. This will have to be done from bottom up, as the SOB takes pains to conceal his abusive treatment of subordinates from management. HR or other professionals may help alert management of the problem, as it may be easier to educate HR than to educate management.

Wash and dry your hair.,

You are basically going to make 5 twists.,

Make the top front one first.,

The twisting technique is rather like making a bun, except this is a very long, skinny one.,

You'll end up with a twisty, coil-like protrusion sticking out of the top of your head!
,

Now take out the back ponytail, divide your hair into two (vertically down the back of your head) and put one side into a bunch to keep it out of the way.
,

Divide the other side into two by drawing a line with your comb from your ear across your head horizontally to meet the vertical parting you've just made.,

Take out the bunch on the other side, divide and twist as in previous step.
,

Now you should have five funny-looking twists sticking out of your head.,

Leave for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
,

In the morning take out the twists one by one, starting with the lower ones.,

When all twists are out, bend over and give it another careful comb (not too much).,
At this stage it may look VERY big.,
Finished.

",How to Curl Hair with Twists," Don't use a conditioner unless it's a very light one and/or your hair really needs it.
, One at the top front (centrally)and then two on each side, one above the other., Divide the hair with a central parting. Then section off from the parting down to the ear on each side. Put those two sections together to make one front section. Tie back the rest of your hair into a rear ponytail - it will make it easier to create your first twist., Keep twisting your hair over and over very tightly until it eventually bends on itself. Then, continue twisting and winding the section of hair around itself, back towards your head. Secure it in the same way you do a bun, with a mini-scrunchie around the base.,,, Twist each section of hair as described above.,, Believe me, it's worth it.,, Remove the band, untwist it a little and comb out your curls with a wide toothed comb., Spray with a strong hairspray. Flip your hair up and part it/arrange it. Then give it another good spray, lifting sections to really get a hold and volume., This is good, it will settle and look great all day.,"

, Breaking them up, you can create a number of different shapes and increase the reflective surface of the disc. Snap the CD into multiple shards and glue onto a surface for a striking mosaic.


If you're breaking CDs, keep the sharp edges in mind. Be careful when you're snapping the discs. Use a hammer to break up smaller pieces and pick up broken sharps gently, as if they were glass.

, They will bear the heat and save your kitchen surfaces from damage. You can paint or draw on the discs to give them some ornamental appeal as well.

, If you snap a CD in half, you'll have a nice decoration to line a flowerbed with. Due to the likelihood that you'll have a lot of CDs to go through, you shouldn't be surprised if you're able to transform your entire garden in this manner.

, If you have enough CDs, you can conceivably cover a wall in this way. Chain links through the CDs and secure the highest CD of each row to the wall by looping the highest link through a nail to the wall.


You can create holes in the CDs by using a drill. Drill it with an old piece of wood underneath.

Choose a school.",How to Choose the Right Online Real Estate School," Real estate licensing happens at the state level.


Some smaller states do not accept licensing courses from online schools. If this is the case, you may have to enroll at a local college or university instead. It’s possible that you can complete some or all of your coursework online through these institutions.
The real estate commission website for your state will likely have a list of approved schools.;
, You can usually find this information on a school's website. If an online real estate school is not accredited by a qualified accrediting agency such as The Association of Real Estate License Law Officials (ARELLO), find another school. Why? Accreditation is your assurance that the course you're taking will lead to a viable certificate or diploma. It tells future employers that your courses were legitimate. Accreditation means that the school


operates on a sound financial basis,
has an approved study program,
employs qualified instructors,
follows approved recruitment and admissions policies, and
advertises its courses factually. , Schools that have been in business for longer will likely run more smoothly. They may be more familiar with state and federal regulations. At the same time, older schools may be more likely to use outdated instructional platforms, so be sure that your school is using the latest technology., If the school’s prices are much higher or much lower than others, this should be a red flag. If you cannot pay for the entire course upfront, look into the school’s options for paying in installments. Some schools that offer payment plans charge an extra fee for this service. Narrow your search down to schools whose prices and payment plans work for you.

, What do former students have to say about the course? Check to see if anyone has complained about the school to the Better Business Bureau., Check exam pass rates. Ultimately, the real test of how effective your school is will be whether you pass your licensing exam or not. The percentage of students who pass their exams will give you a good idea of how good a school is. Also check on course completion rates. Low completion rates may indicate that the school does not offer adequate student support. , You did your research, but how do you know if the course you purchased is really worth it? Some online real estate schools have a money-back guarantee that allows you to return the course materials within a specific timeframe. Take the time to understand how these guarantees work and take careful note of deadlines.

, Make a list of questions about the course, and call the number provided on the school's website. If you reach a computerized answering service, try to select an option to speak to an actual human. If there is no option to reach someone who works there, consider that you may not get the support that you need from this school.

, There are dozens of online real estate schools out there. A spreadsheet will help you keep track of which ones meet your personal criteria. Use your spreadsheet to help you eliminate schools that won’t work for you as a learner. You may want to include categories for


Your finances. How much can you afford to pay for real estate school right now? Will you need to seek out a program that offers a payment plan?
Your schedule. If you have a lot of work and family obligations that fluctuate from week to week, you may need to select a school that has flexible due dates.
Your learning style. Consider how you have learned best in the past. Do you need visuals? Do you require a lot of contact with your instructors?

, A student support department should help your online experience run smoothly. Make sure your online school's support department is staffed by more than one person. Ideally, they should have multiple contact options including email, phone, and fax.

, Educational support staff ensure that you're never left floundering because you don’t understand the material. The school should employ experts who know the ins and outs of real estate laws and procedures. If you’re struggling with the escrow process discussed in chapter six, an online school's educational support department will walk you through the steps.


If the school offers no educational support or does not staff experts, you may want to reconsider the school.

, You don’t want to miss a deadline because of a glitchy website. Your online school should offer a tech support department that quickly answers your questions and remedies your computer frustrations via phone, email, or fax. Check to see whether this department has limited hours or is available 24/7. A school where the tech support is slow to respond or unhelpful when they do respond is probably not the best choice for distance learning.

, Many online real estate schools have videos or “quick tours” that show you how their courses work. This can be a great way to weed out the schools that aren’t right for you. If there isn't a demo class, call or email the school and ask if there is another way to preview a course before you sign on.

, Compare your findings to the priorities you listed on your spreadsheet. Try to find out


To what extent will the courses feel like in-person courses? Are there instructional videos?
Can you interact with professionals who lead the courses? Are they available by email and phone? Do they hold office hours?
Can you access the course from a tablet or phone, or is it restricted to computers?
Can you work at your own pace, or are there strict deadlines?
Are there student study groups that you can join?
Are there quizzes throughout the course to ensure that you are staying up to speed?
Will you need to purchase a textbook? If so, is the format an ebook or a physical textbook?
Can you take practice exams?

, Does the school offer both general real estate courses and state-specific content? Be sure to the school offers everything that your state-based licensure will require.

, Pick the one that best meets your personal criteria as a student (affordable, works with your schedule, delivers content in a way that makes sense to you) and offers the content you need for your licensure.

Change up your subjects.",How to Study Efficiently," Researchers have found that the way students approach studying is almost as important as what and how students study.Think positively. Don't let yourself feel overwhelmed or intimidated. Believe in yourself and your ability to meet this challenge.
Don't think about worst-case scenarios. Manage your time, and try to look on the bright side of your study situation, even if it's unpleasant or stressful.
See each obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow.
Don't compare your grades to anyone else's. Competitive thinking will only stress you out further.;
, Staying on schedule can help you manage your time and your workload, and may make it easier to focus on the task at hand.Try entering a ""date"" with yourself to study in your planner or calendar. You may be more likely to take your study sessions as a serious responsibility if they're formal appointments with yourself.

, Studies suggest that alternating where a person studies can actually improve information retention.Know whether you work best in a quiet space or with ambient noise.
Try studying with the windows open (weather permitting). Researchers have found fresh air to be energizing and revitalizing., You shouldn't be so comfortable that you'll fall asleep, but feeling uncomfortable can make it difficult to concentrate. Set up a comfortable atmosphere conducive to studying.


Choose a chair that will be comfortable to sit on for upwards of one hour at a time. Use a desk or table so you can spread out your study materials.Avoid your bed. You might get so comfortable that you don't study. Associating other activities than sleep with your bed can also make it harder for you to sleep well., Turn your cell phone and TV off and resist the urge to check your social media accounts. These kinds of distractions can deter you from work and can make it difficult to retain information you are learning.You may think that you're a good multi-tasker, but st

, Breaking up the material you need to cover into small, manageable chunks is more effective than trying to memorize everything all at once. Cover material in shorter sessions over a period of several days or even weeks for the best results., This will keep you awake and help you focus as you read, study, and prepare for class. Studies have shown that caffeine not only helps you feel alert, it may help improve your memory.Just don't overdo it. Too much caffeine can make you feel jittery, anxious, or stressed-out. Experts recommend that kids and teens limit their consumption of caffeine to 100-200mg per day. That's just 1-2 cups of coffee, 1-3 Red Bulls, or 3-6 colas., Studies show that making cardio workouts a part of your routine can improve memory and overall mental health., Researchers have found that students who study together in groups tend to perform better on tests and quizzes., Ask your instructor's permission before recording any part of your class sessions. With his or her permission, use an audio recording device during class. If you're using a digital recorder, convert the file into an mp3 and listen to your lecture while you're commuting or working out in the morning.

, Write down important ideas, concepts, names, and dates, rather than trying to take down every single word your instructor is saying., This should be done immediately after class, if possible. If you cannot study right after class has ended, studying as soon as possible that day is crucial, as most in-class information is forgotten after 24 hours.Read through each line of notes slowly and carefully.
Ask your instructor about anything that doesn't make sense or is unclear to you.

, This will allow you to compile the most vital information in one place, and can help you make more sense of the notes you took in class. But don't just copy the material mindlessly! Rephrasing class notes in your own words will also help you understand the material beyond simply re-stating what you've been told., This will help reinforce the things you learned that week, and may help you contextualize each day's lesson better within the framework of the entire week's lesson plan., Color-coding your notes by lesson or topic may be helpful, or try using a series of folders to create an orderly system.Try different organization methods until you find one that works right for you. This may include organizing handouts separate from notes, or organizing everything by date, by chapter, or by topic.

, Flashcards can help you memorize important names, dates, places, events, and concepts. They can be used for nearly every single subject taught in school.Choose the most important names, dates, concepts, etc.
Write the name on one side and the definition on the back. For math formulae, write the equation on one side and the solution on the back.
Quiz yourself. Once you've mastered giving the definition or solution based on the front of the card, try quizzing yourself by going through the cards in reverse - that is, read the definition or solution on the ""back"" of the card and challenge yourself to give the correct term or equation written on the ""front"" of the card.
Break your flashcards up into manageable sections. Just as cramming from notes/lesson plans is ill-advised, research has shown that the strategy called ""spacing"" is also more effective than cramming when it comes to flashcards. Don't try to learn more than 10-12 flashcards at a time., Associating names or terms with something simple to remember can make it easier to memorize information from your notes.Don't get too complex with your mnemonic devices. They should be easy to remember and simple to apply on a test.
Song lyrics might be easiest to use. If you get stuck, try humming the song's rhythm to yourself, associating the lyrics with whatever material you're trying to memorize., You don't have to be chained to a desk to study. Use technology to liberate your study sessions so you can study anytime, anywhere.Many mobile apps will allow you to create flashcards. You can review them anywhere, whether you're standing in line at the store or riding the bus.
Try recording your notes in a wiki or blog. You can tag these posts with relevant keywords, making finding your material a snap when it comes time to study. You can also review them anywhere you have an internet connection.

, Look for text written in bold or italics, or off-set in a chart or graph. Also look for sections at the end of each chapter that condenses the key concepts from that unit. Information presented in any of these ways tends to be of the highest importance when teachers prepare a test on that chapter or section.If you're studying a creative work, such as a play or novel, look for patterns and themes. Motifs (elements that carry additional meaning, such as darkness, blood, gold) may repeat across the text, suggesting that they’re important to pay attention to. “Big ideas” are also good to focus on.
If your teacher permits it, you can use a study guide such as Cliffs Notes or Shmoop to help you understand the plot, so that you can focus on more important themes and patterns. Don’t rely on these guides to tell you everything you need to know! Use them only as supplements to other study and reading techniques.

, Now that you've skimmed the chapter and made note of the key concepts, read the whole section at least once, paying attention to details and taking notes along the way. This will allow you to understand the material and contextualize that chapter within the larger unit.

, Active reading, which involves asking questions of the reading and taking notes, is proven to be more effective and efficient than passively reading through just to finish the chapter.Draw a bracket around key concepts in the chapter, and circle any terms or names you're not familiar with.
Write questions in the margins as you read, then find the answers to those questions., This will help you make better sense of the material and will help you remember those concepts more concretely.Remember that restating can also condense and focus. As you restate, make sure you pay attention to what seems most important.
For example, consider this passage: “Students frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes.” Lester, James D. Writing Research Papers. 2nd ed. (1976): 46-47.A restatement of the key concept could look like this: “Take fewer direct quotations in notes bc too many could cause over-quotation in final paper. 10% max quotes in final.”
As you can see, this has captured the most important information from the passage, but it’s in your own words, and it’s much shorter -- meaning it will be easier to remember later.

, Go over your notes and any flashcards you've made. Quiz yourself once you've read through all of your notes several times through. You should be able to recall most of the key concepts, names, and dates. Repeat this review process as often as necessary to keep the information in your mind as you prepare for upcoming quizzes and tests., Studies have found that the most efficient way to study is in short bursts, typically in 1-3 hour increments. Give yourself several days, each with several sessions, to prepare., Research suggests that studying related but varied material in one sitting is more efficient and effective than studying just one subject material in a given session.You can also try to relate material you’re learning to stuff you already know. You can even create connections between new material and pop culture. You’re more likely to remember new material if it’s linked to things you’re already familiar with."

Place a cardboard box inside a larger cardboard box.,
Line the inside of the smaller box with black construction paper, to absorb heat.,
Cover each piece of cardboard with reflective material such as foil.,
Attach each reflector to the top of one side of the box.,
Prop each reflector up at around a 45 degree angle.,
Position the oven in full sun, place food in the smaller box, and wait for it to cook.",How to Make and Use a Solar Oven1," Make sure there is at least an inch of clearance between the sides, and fill the gap with shredded newspaper, which will act as an insulator.;
, Next, cut the flaps from flat cardboard sheets in the shape of slightly flared squares. Since you will be attaching these to the walls of your box, the width of each narrow end of each square should equal the width of the side you’ll be attaching it to; the width of each flared end should be several inches wider than the width of the narrow end.

, Make sure it sits tightly around the reflector, and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. Secure the material with rubber cement or tape on one side of each cardboard piece.

, You can glue, staple, or thread them as necessary, allowing them to flop over for now.

, The easiest, most secure way to do this is to connect the reflectors together at the flared top corners (ex. by piercing adjacent corners and tying them together with thread, then untying them for disassembly). You can also stick rods in the ground underneath the reflectors, stack something underneath each reflector, or use any other method that will hold them securely in place. If it’s a windy day, make sure your reflectors won’t blow over.


If using rods, glue the reflectors to the rods to add more stability.

, It is best to cook the food in jars or on a small, dark baking pan. Experiment with cooking times and how and where you place the box. You may need to reposition your box several times during cooking to catch the sun.

Get a debit card instead of a credit card.,
Think carefully before making a purchase with your credit card.,
Create a rainy-day fund.Set aside some of your monthly income for financial emergencies.,
Identify signs you might be a spendthrift.,
Find help for your spending habit.",How to Avoid Credit Card Debt1," If you are tired of the inconvenience of paying cash, but don’t want to rack up credit card debt, using a debit card is the perfect third way. A debit card works just like a credit card: with an easy swipe of the card, you can make purchases almost anywhere. However, while a credit card basically operates as a loan-making tool, a debit card lets you tap directly into your bank account. This way, you won’t end up having to pay the credit card company back when making a purchase.


Be careful. Practice responsible buying with your debit card just as you would with your credit cards.;
, Before buying anything, always ask yourself: “Do I need this?” If you think the purchase is worthy, follow up with the question “Can I pay cash? Or do I need to charge this to my credit card?”


If you do choose to purchase luxury items with your credit card, give yourself a waiting period before deciding to do so. When you see something in a store or online that you want to purchase, freeze your credit card in a plastic pitcher of water. Place the pitcher in the fridge after it is completely frozen. If you still believe that making the purchase would be a wise investment after the card has been unfrozen, and you’ve consulted your partner about it, make the purchase.
Do not use your credit card on things like cars and clothes. Luxury items like home gym equipment and new TVs, similarly, should be purchased with cash. Finally, avoid getting disposable goods like groceries and toiletries on credit.If you carry a balance, you’ll be paying interest on things which potentially don’t even exist anymore. This is not wise use of your money.
Good investments with a credit card include educational or business expenses. Emergencies, especially medical emergencies, might also require use of credit cards.
Try living without your credit card for thirty days. When you use only cash, you are much more likely to notice where your money is going and how often you’re running out.Perhaps you withdraw $200 thinking you’re covered for the week, but end up needing $300. Thinking about the difference between the expectations you have of your spending and the actual way you spend your money can shock you into being more thoughtful with your finances, and ultimately change the way you spend when you go back to using credit cards at the end of thirty days.

, If you lose your job or need to invest in something expensive like surgery, you’ll be glad you have that money. Another equally important use you might be able to put the money to is credit card debt. If you sense your debt is beginning to spiral out of control (accruing a lot of fees and high interest), dip into this fund to pay down your debt.

, If you are a spendthrift, you will purchase things you do not really need on a regular basis. Your spending habits will be so rash and reckless that it may seem as if your money is evaporating into thin air.Other signs you’re a spendthrift include feeling a rush of excitement while shopping and making the purchase, but feeling guilty after getting home or being confronted by your spouse or partner about what you’ve purchased.
You might also have many items in your home with their price tags still attached.
If you find yourself lying to your spouse or partner about how much you’ve spent, or it seems you two are constantly fighting about your spending habits, you may be a spendthrift.

, Being a spendthrift is not a permanent state. The first step toward changing is admitting that you have a spending habit and want to stop. Ask your spouse, partner, or friends to reign you in if they see you consider making large, unnecessary purchases. Talk to a therapist about your behavior to see if you can identify the root cause(s) which drive you to spend money so recklessly.Alternately, talk to a financial advisor about how to budget your money and find areas where you can cut expenses.

Notice any ear sensitivity.,
Look for excessive scratching.,
Check for any discharge.,
Look for problems walking.,
Check for any redness and swelling.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ear Infections in Cats1," Ear infections can make your cat’s ears sensitive to touch. You may notice this when you pet your cat’s head. They may shy away from you or react negatively if you touch their ears.You may try to massage near the base of the cat’s ear. If they have an ear infection, they will feel discomfort.;
, Ear infections can cause a lot of itching and discomfort. Due to this, your cat may scratch at their ears or rub them against the floor or soft objects. Watch your cat for targeted scratching around their ears.Due to this scratching, the ears or head may end up with wounds or trauma.
Your cat may also shake their head a lot.

, Another common symptom that occurs with ear infections is discharge. This may be debris around the opening of the ear canal or inside of the ear, or it may be wet pus. This discharge may have a bad odor.The discharge may be yellow, dark brown, or black in color. It may be crusty on the ear or be thick and oozing.

, Some infections deep in the ear can cause your cat to walk awkwardly. They may tilt their head to one side as they walk, or they may have balance problems and lack coordination.Your cat may also walk around in circles as they tilt their head.

, Your cat’s ear may be red due to the infection or constant scratching and rubbing. The skin inside the ear and around the ear canal may also be irritated and red. The skin of the ear may also be swollen.Check for any red nodules or blood-filled pockets inside the ear.

Go high- or low-maintenance.,
Know how to style a mohawk.",How to Make Your Hair Punk3," Punk hairstyles can run the gamut from carefully constructed liberty spikes to dreadlocks. Evaluate how much time you're willing to invest in doing your hair every day, and style accordingly. Browse the internet for some styles that might interest you.

, A mohawk is an iconic punk style. Here's how to make one.


Blow dry hair with a paddle brush. Hang your head upside down, and blast hair with a blow dyer on high heat.
Apply fixative. Rub the necessary amount of gel, glue, gelatin, hair wax or other fixative on your hands. With your head still upside down, put your hands together with your hair in the middle and pull downward to create spikes.
Use a flat iron. Go over your mohawk with a thin flat iron, head still upside down. Move in slow strokes. The gel might sizzle on the heat, but your hair won't actually burn if you keep moving the flat iron.
Apply hairspray. Buy the strongest possible hairspray you can (check the bottle for a ""hold"" number) and use it liberally on your mohawk. For extra hold, flat iron again, then spray one last time.

Choose the type of quinoa.,
Purchase dry or pre-cooked quinoa.,
Rinse quinoa before using.,
Store cooked quinoa correctly.",How to Make Healthier Breakfasts Using Quinoa3," Quinoa is now available in most local supermarkets. You don't have to go to a specialty store or health foods store to find this nutritious grain.

When you're looking for quinoa, it will be found in the grain aisle along with rice, couscous and pasta.
There may be more than one type of quinoa available. You may see white, black, red or even tri-colored quinoa.Of all the quinoa colors, white or tan quinoa has the lightest texture and it cooks up slightly fluffier than other types and has the most delicate taste. Black quinoa has a slight earthy flavor while the red quinoa has a richer taste and a bit chewier texture and nutty. These two take slightly longer to cook than the white quinoa.
If you're using quinoa in a breakfast recipe, especially if kids are eating it, you may want to stick with white as it's most similar in color to oats.

, Most of the time, you'll be able to find uncooked quinoa in the grain aisle of the grocery store; however, some stores may have pre-cooked quinoa for you.

Quinoa only takes about 15 minutes to cook from scratch. If you can only find uncooked quinoa, that will work perfectly in many breakfast recipes. Plus its not hard to cook from scratch.
If you are lacking in time or are unsure of how to cook quinoa, some stores sell precooked quinoa. You might find this in the grain aisle, refrigerated section, on the salad bar or even in the frozen section.
Pre-cooked quinoa may be a little bit more convenient and make for a faster breakfast recipe.

, If you haven't cooked quinoa before, there is a little secret trick to make it correctly. You'll need to rinse it first before cooking it.Quinoa has a coating on the outside of the seed that acts as a natural pest repellent. It's called saponin. This is a natural compound that tastes bitter and soapy if not removed from the quinoa.
Place quinoa in a fine mesh strainer or a sieve. Run it under cold water, stirring or shaking it to help get all the seeds washed thoroughly.
Transfer your washed quinoa directly to your pot or pan and begin to cook it.
Note that some boxed quinoa or quinoa mixes are already washed or rinsed. You do not need to repeat this step. Make sure to read the instructions on boxes or packages first.

, Many of the breakfast recipes that do use quinoa, call for cooked quinoa. Making it in advance can help cut down on an extra step and cooking time in the mornings.

Consider taking time on the weekend or a free weeknight to go ahead and cook up a batch of quinoa.
Make sure to review what recipes you'll be making for breakfast and note how much cooked quinoa you'll need for the week.
Dry quinoa usually doubles in volume after cooking. 1/2 cup of uncooked or dry quinoa results in about 1 cup of cooked quinoa.
Store quinoa in a airtight container in the refrigerator for about five to seven days. You can also store it in a freezer container for up to three months.

Wash the zucchini.,
Trim off the ends.,
Remove the seeds.,
Select either a plank grater or a box grater.,
Choose the style of grated zucchini you'd like.,
Hold the utensil firmly in one hand.,
Be careful as you get close to your fingers.,
Set up your food processor.,
Prepare the zucchini.,
Turn the machine on and feed the zucchini into the food chute.",How to Grate Zucchini," Even if there's no visible dirt you should always wash them under fresh running water to rinse them of any pesticides or lingering bacteria. With your hand, gently rub the skin of the zucchini while holding it under water until it no longer feels gritty.;
, Remove both the stem end and the flower end of the zucchini with a sharp paring knife.

, If the zucchini is greater than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter then the seeds may be large and bitter. If this is the case then carefully split the zucchini from end to end, lengthwise.


Hold a spoon firmly in one hand and the zucchini in the other, run the tip of the spoon down the zucchini with gentle pressure to remove the seeds. If your zucchini are smaller then you're ready to grate them.

, Set the grater on a firm surface such as a cutting board. You can either grate the zucchini in a pile straight on the cutting board, or you can place a bowl under the grater to catch the grated zucchini and make your clean-up easier.

, Most graters have both coarse and fine patches of the grating surface. Grate a bit on each to test and see what size looks right for your purposes.

Some graters will have a mandoline-style slit for grating, which will result in thin sliced rounds of zucchini, appropriate for stir-fry, lasagna, or other uses in which you'd like to see the zucchini. This would probably be inappropriate for baking into zucchini bread, however.

, With the other hand, hold the zucchini. Evenly run the zucchini up and down the coarse-holed side of the grater while pressing down firmly.


A box grater will collect the zucchini inside, and you'll need to remove it in order to grate several zucchini. As the zucchini accumulates under the plank grater you can simply scoop it aside to continue grating.

, You'll have to reposition your fingers slightly as you gradually grate up the zucchini. Eventually, there won't be much left to hold. Don't try to grate it until it disappears, because you'll end up with a little fingertip in your cookies if you're not careful.


If you're feeling thrifty, stab the nub of zucchini left with a fork and try to grate as much as possible with that, your fingers safely out of the way.

, Affix the coarsest or largest hole grating attachment, according to your food processor's directions.


Make sure the appliance is clean and assembled properly before starting to grate.

, Depending on the size of your food processor, you might want to chop your larger cleaned zucchini into some smaller pieces before you start feeding it into the food processor.

, When the receiving bowl is full, empty the contents, reattach the bowl and continue grating.

Find the smallest, thinnest surgical tubing you can find.,
If you use rubber bands you will first have to loop the bands together by putting one through another and back through itself before it's pulled tight.,
Once you have the full length you need (about 20 ft.) divide it into 3rds and cut it into separate pieces.,
String one of the hooks along one of the strands until it's next to the knot.

,
Begin to braid the three strands in a common overlap pattern.,
Once you're satisfied with the braided strands, Put the second hook in one of the strands.,
It's ready to use almost anywhere, anytime, without hangers, clothespins or hanging things over the line.

,
Loop each end around some fixtures so the entire line is slightly stretched.,
When you go to hang anything, pull one of the strands away from the other two and place a small corner of the garment through the gap.",How to Make a Clothesline to Use Without Hangers," If not surgical tubing, you can use some form of long rubber band. If you can't find something like these, buy a box of the heavy gauge rubber bands that the post office uses around bundles of mail. You will want about 20 feet (6.1 m) of the item in it's unstretched condition. You will need two small gate hooks from any hardware store, too. (See tips below.);
, By linking these together you will end up with a long stretchy band of continuous rubber bands.

, Tie one end of all three strands into a knot so it ends up looking like three strands of spaghetti hanging from your hand.

,, This is what you may have learned in elementary school. You know, lay them side by side and take the left one over the middle one to become the middle one and then take the right one over the middle one to make a new middle one. Keep repeating this process until the entire length is braided. Don't do it too loose or real tight. You might want to experiment a little before the next step.

, Tie off the final end by wrapping it in strong string, wire, several twist-ties, or something that will keep if from unraveling, or simply tie them in a knot again.

,, It should be about 6 feet (1.8 m). long when up.

, For example you can take the bottom hem of a shirt and put a small part through the braided strands then take another part of the bottom hem on the other side of the shirt and do the same thing further down the line.

You can also do it with a wooden spoon, but it will take longer.For a less sweet cinnamon butter, use 1 cup (225 grams) of butter instead., Use a low-speed setting, and occasionally scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. This will ensure that everything mixes evenly.


For a less sweet cinnamon butter, omit the confectioner's sugar. The extra butter you added earlier will make up for the missing sugar.,, A couple of 4-ounce (120 milliliters) or half-pint (240 milliliters) mason jar would be ideal.Try to use a container made out of glass (as opposed to plastic) to best preserve the flavor.

Use a peroxide rinse.,
Apply one type of vegetable.,
Chew mint leaves.",How to Ease a Toothache1," One of the first things you want to do is make sure that your mouth is clean and that there isn't bits of food bothering the painful spot. Water that is too cold or too hot can hurt your mouth, so definitely go for lukewarm to warm water.Floss gently between your teeth. Flossing gets rid of the food and bacteria still lingering in your mouth, and increases the gum protection against harmful species that can insert in the gum sulcus. Avoid flossing too roughly around the affected area because this could cause it to hurt more and to bleed.;
, Sometimes the best way to deal with the pain is to mask it with pain medication until you can see a dentist. Most over the counter medication will work fine for your toothache and if it's so severe that the medication doesn't work, you should see someone right away.









Aspirin is especially helpful for problems in the joint of the jaw in adults.
Acetaminophen (not aspirin) should be used for children and teenagers.

, This can help to ease the toothache by numbing the pain. Using this in conjunction with over the counter medication can help ease your pain until the painkiller can kick in.








, Saltwater can kill bacteria and make your toothache feel better. It can also ease it so that it doesn't get infected. Mix 1 tsp (5 g) of salt in a medium-sized glass of warm water.








Swirl it around in your mouth for a maximum of five minutes and spit it out. Make sure that you don't swallow!

, Soak a cotton ball in a mixture of a few drops of garlic clove oil and a small amount of olive oil, and apply the cotton ball to the area of pain.







, The natural tannins already in the tea can help to numb the pain. This is particularly good for the swelling or irritation of your gums. Make sure that the teabag isn't too hot otherwise you'll simply hurt the area more.









Constant exposure can stain teeth so use sparingly.

, As with salt water, a peroxide rinse helps remove contaminants and limits the growth of bacteria. It's particularly good for impacted teeth or infections in your mouth and you can use it periodically throughout the day until you can see an emergency dentist.









This should not replace your regular brushing and flossing.
Do not sue a peroxide rinse more than three times in a day for more than five days in a row, otherwise your teeth may get very sensitive.

, There are several types of vegetables that you can cut up and place on the injured area. These can help ease the pain and the chance of infection, but they shouldn't replace actually visiting the dentist if your pain persists.








Place a slice of cool cucumber over the sore area.
Cut up a piece of raw, fresh potato and hold in place on the sore spot in your mouth. Make sure that you've peeled it too.
Hold a slice of freshly cut onion inside your mouth against the injured area. It needs to be freshly cut so that there's a bit of juice.

, You can either chew on fresh mint leaves, or hold some dry mint leaves in place over the sore area. If your tooth hurts too much to chew, then you should place some mashed or dry mint leaves over the infected area.

Empty, drain or cover all things that can and may hold water.,

Clean bird baths weekly.,
Repair or prevent outside leaks.,
Maintain swimming pools with proper care.,
Keep the rain gutters and drains clean.,
Prevent other sources of standing water.",How to Prevent Mosquitoes from Breeding1," Areas of your backyard or porch may have spots where rainwater can pool. Barrels and trash cans tend to collect rainwater extremely well. Old tires, empty bottles, buckets, and other small containers can condense water vapor into tiny pools. Empty and drain all pools of water and cover them up to prevent more water from gathering.;
, When you water your plants, the excess water will run through the soil and collect in a pan. If you have any outdoor plants, these collection pans are a prime location for mosquitoes to breed. Empty and clean the pans at least once a week, preferably more frequently.

, If you have a bird bath outside your house, the stagnant water is a perfect place for mosquitoes to lay eggs. Minimize mosquitoes breeding there by changing the water and scrubbing down the bath at least once a week, preferably more frequently.

, Plumbing that runs outside can be affected by exposure to the weather, resulting in minor leaks. Window air conditioners often drip condensation, which can pool on the ground. Dripping outdoor faucets also pool on the ground. Repair these problems to minimize water collection as much as possible.

, If you have a small plastic pool meant to be used temporarily, make sure you drain all of the water and store it indoors when it's not in use. If you have a backyard swimming pool, monitor the chlorine levels regularly and keep the pool clean.

, If they are filled with debris, they will trap water during the next rainfall instead of letting it drain. Mosquitoes will then breed in this standing water., Standing water is the number one breeding spot for mosquitoes. Sometimes, it is nearly impossible to find all bodies of standing water and draining them. However, there are a few precautions you can take to prevent water from building up. Here are some tips to get you started:Get rid of any unused pots or bins or turn them upside down, so they don't collect water.
Keep trash and recycling bins covered. If you can't, try drilling drain holes into the bottom of them.
Keep a fine-mesh screen over rain barrels, water tanks, and cisterns.
Take a look at your plants. Are any of them collecting water in between the leaves and the stems? If so, consider poking a tiny hole with a pin into those areas to allow for proper drainage."

Add the right amount of detergent to your load based on packaging instructions.,
Use the right type of bleach, or natural alternatives to bleach.,
Consider using a bluing agent to neutralize yellow stains on white fabric.,
Transfer whites from the washing machine to dryer immediately when the washing machine stops.,
Inspect all clothes for remaining stains before placing in the dryer.,
Dry whites accordingly based on care instructions.,
Hang all whites to dry outside in the sun whenever possible.",How to Wash White Clothes," Whites should always be washed separately from colored clothes to avoid colors transferring to and staining white clothes.;
, This helps prevent colors from bleeding onto all-white clothes, despite how small the surface area of color may be. For example, separate a white shirt with bright red stripes from all-white t-shirts.

, This prevents dirt, food, and other debris on soiled white clothes from staining other white clothing. For example, if a white shirt is caked with mud after spending an afternoon gardening, separate that particular shirt from cleaner, brighter-looking whites.

, Tags and clothing labels provide washing instructions for water temperature, washing cycle, and whether or not you can use bleach. For example, place all gentle-cycle clothing in one pile, and regular, permanent-press clothing in another pile., This prevents lint from accumulating and sticking to fabrics from which lint is difficult to remove. For example, wash white towels separately from white pants made from corduroy to prevent lint from sticking to corduroy.

, Hot water is more effective at killing germs and bacteria, and helps keep whites looking white.


Make adjustments to water temperature as needed based on care labels to prevent clothes from shrinking or becoming misshapen. For instance, clothing made from nylon, spandex, lycra, and certain cotton blends may shrink in hot water.Use cool water when washing stained white clothes. Stains from items such as wine, chocolate, and tea come out better in cool water, which also helps prevent stains from bleeding onto other whites.

, The amount of detergent you should use depends on load size, and on the strength level of your detergent brand.


Avoid adding more detergent than recommended by the packaging. Excess detergent can lead to filmy buildup that attracts more dirt and is more noticeable on white clothing.

, Bleach helps whiten clothes, but can be toxic and irritating to sensitive skin. Consider using chlorine bleach to help remove heavy stains, or combine one part bleach and one part baking soda to neutralize the toxicity of pure bleach.


Use bleach as directed on the packaging label to avoid using too much, which can stain your clothes gray or yellow.
Avoid using bleach on delicate clothing, since chlorine- and oxygen-based bleach brands can weaken fabrics and lead to tearing or fraying.
Substitute bleach with household ingredients that have natural bleaching properties, such as lemon juice, white vinegar, baking soda, or hydrogen peroxide. These ingredients make whites whiter without the added risks of toxicity and skin irritation.

, Bluing agent formulas make whites whiter by releasing a small amount of blue dye to the water and removing during the rinse cycle.

, This helps prevent whites from developing mold or mildew as a result from sitting in the washer for too long.

, This prevents dryer heat from setting in stains if stains aren’t completely removed.


Rewash stained clothes in the washing machine as needed before transferring to the dryer.

, Some clothes may instruct you to “lay flat to dry,” or recommend a particular dryer setting. For example, fabrics such as nylon and acrylic may require a lower temperature setting since these fibers tend to absorb less water.

, The sun’s ultraviolet rays have a natural bleaching effect on clothing that helps keep whites white. Allowing clothes to hang-dry is often more cost-effective than using your dryer."

Be quietly confident.,
Remember that every woman/girl is unique.,
Dress appropriately.,
Treat people in the way that you would like people to treat you!",How to Be a Gentleman Towards Girls," When you meet a girl for the first time, be sure make eye contact and maintain it as you introduce yourselves to each other. Don't look at the floor or stare at her body.;
,, As you're talking with each other, don't interrupt her. Ask her questions about herself. Don't get too personal, though. Keep it light at first by asking her about her career, her studies, her hobbies, little things like that. As with step 1, make sure you maintain eye contact as you're talking with her. This shows her that you're paying attention to what she is saying.

, If she's talking about a particular activity that she likes to do, you can say that you like the same activity. But don't try to impress her by bragging about your skill. This is a conversation, not a competition.

, Just because you choose to act like a gentleman doesn't mean that you're not confident in yourself. Part of being a gentleman is not acting arrogantly. It doesn't help being handsome without having confidence in yourself.

, Once you have this in mind life gets easier ... why? If you act like a gentleman and one girl still rejects you, don't let that stop you from acting like a gentleman. Another girl will appreciate your behavior and will be attracted to you. There are more girls in the world than men. Don't forget this.

, Part of being a gentleman is being well-groomed. Make sure you wear clothes you feel comfortable in. They should fit well and make you feel confident. You should also appear and smell clean.

, Ladies expect a gentleman to treat other people with common courtesy. So show how much of a gentleman you can be in dealing with waitstaff at a restaurant or a barista who gets a coffee order wrong.

Buy recycled cartridges.",How to Recycle Empty Ink and Toner Cartridges3," You can recycle ink cartridges on your own through simple reuse. Most office supplies stores will refill old ink or toner cartridges for a small fee. This is usually cheaper than purchasing new cartridges and allows you to cut back on your carbon footprint., You should also work on using less ink and paper in general. This can cut back on waste, and will result in your cartridges lasting longer. Try to read documents on screen. When possible, opt to fill out forms online. Go for electronic tickets when traveling, and have itineraries pulled up on your phone instead of printed on paper.

, You can purchase ink and toner cartridges that have been remanufactured online or at local outlets where they are sold. Many people prefer to buy recycled cartridges to reduce waste, and because they are often cheaper. Usually, recycled cartridges work well. However, make sure to take certain precautions before making a purchase.Read reviews of any company you do business with. It takes some work to repurpose cartridges, and some companies do so better than others.
See if there is a return policy or warranty. Companies invested in quality usually offer returns or warranties upfront.

Emphasize comedy in screenwriting with dialogue.,
Use long-term character development in a comedic novel.,
Surprise the reader in a comedic play.",How to Write a Comedy4," Use dialogue to add humour to a screenplay. Have witty back and forth between characters. Have one character who is full of funny one-liners. Create running jokes that are said throughout the screenplay by different characters. Dialogue gives you a chance to have your characters tell jokes to one another and be witty.For example, you may have one character who uses a signature catch phrase and tone of voice to say their dialogue, creating humor.

, Develop a character over a long period of a time in a novel so they become endearing, witty, and funny to the reader. Give them a funny childhood or a unique sense of humor. Let the character's voice and actions come through as the novel progresses and add in funny or amusing details about the character. The reader will then get a sense of humor from the character.For example, you may have a character who seems minor in the story but always has a funny aside. You may then have them become more important as the novel progresses, putting their humor front and center.

, The element of surprise can be a fun way to jolt your reader and make them laugh. Have a plot twist in the play that you find funny and surprising. Keep the viewer guessing and use the element of suspense to create surprise and laughter.For example, you may have a big reveal 3/4 of the way into the play where a character turns out to be a woman dressed as a man. You may stage the reveal so it is funny and surprising for your audience.

Learn the terms relevant to the game.,
Learn how you win the game.,
Recognize the 10 phases of the game.",How to Play Phase 102," These are necessary to learn before you get started playing. You don’t have to memorize them all immediately, just keep this sheep handy so that you can refer to it as the game goes on. As you continue playing the terms will start to stick in your memory.


A set is 2 or more cards of the same number
A run is 4 or more cards numbered consecutively (e.g. a 1 card, a 2 card, a 3 card, and a 4 card)
A wild card can be used to complete a phase when a player is missing one of the necessary cards
A skip card allows the player who uses it to choose another player to lose their turn

Hitting lets players discard cards they don't want, so long as they play them immediately after a phase has been laid down; an example of this would be adding red cards to an initial play of 7 red cards (which is phase 8 of the game). However, players are only allowed to participate in hitting if they've already played their own phase for that round, and only when it's their turn.

Going out describes the action of a player getting rid of their whole hand in a round, either by hitting or by using all their cards in their phase. As soon as any player goes out, the round ends and all players discard their cards to be shuffled and dealt for a new round.

, The winner of the round is the first one to go out, or use up all their cards. The winner of each round scores a 0. Scoring is one of the most important parts of Phase 10, since the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10 rounds is the winner. Scoring is calculated at the end of each round. The rest of the players gain points for the cards still in their hands. Cards numbered 1 through 9 are worth 5 points
Cards numbered 10 through 12 are worth 10 points
Skip cards are worth 15 points
Wild cards are worth 25 points

, There are at least 10 rounds in Phase 10 and, consequently, 10 phases of play. The phases are listed below. Phase 1 is 2 sets of 3
Phase 2 is 1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4
Phase 3 is 1 set of 4 and 1 run of 4
Phase 4 is 1 run of 7
Phase 5 is 1 run of 8
Phase 6 is 1 run of 9
Phase 7 is 2 sets of 4
Phase 8 is 7 cards of the same color
Phase 9 is 1 set of 5 and 1 set of 2
Phase 10 is 1 set of 5 and 1 set of 3

Avoid chlorinated water.,

Have a soothing saline solution handy.,
Squint, rather than opening your eyes completely.,
Enter the water with your eyes closed.,
Try squinting at first.,
Slowly open your eyes wider.,
Close your eyes as soon as they start to sting.,
If you're having trouble, test your skills in a controlled environment.",How to Open Your Eyes Underwater Without Goggles on and Not Hurt," While you may not always be able to choose where you're going to swim, it is helpful to know which kinds of water cause the most eye pain. For example, chlorinated water (like you will usually find in pools, hot tubs, and so on) tends to hurt more than ordinary water when it gets in your eyes. While it's great for killing waterborne germs, the redness and stinging you can get after a dip in the pool can be seriously annoying.


Chlorine hurts more because it disrupts the eye's natural tear membrane. In some cases, chlorine can also dehydrate the cornea, leading to cloudy, distorted vision for a short time.;
, Another common source of eye irritation while swimming is salt water. Salt naturally draws moisture out of the eyes, dehydrating them and causing a stinging sensation. In addition, the sorts of places where you're likely to swim in salt water (like beaches) can have additional contaminants in the water like biological matter, silt, and pollution.


The eyes are naturally covered with a salty fluid (you are probably aware of this if you've ever tasted your own tears). However, the average salt content of the ocean is usually about three to four times more salty, leading to the imbalance that dehydrates your eyes., Most optometrists (eye doctors) recommend against swimming with your contacts in. Depending on which type of contacts you are wearing, the water can cause the contact to deform and press against the eye, causing pain. Contacts can also trap bacteria and microorganisms from the water against the eye, which (in rare cases) can lead to infections that cause serious vision problems.If you must wear contacts underwater, use single-use disposable contacts and discard them after you swim. This way, you won't need to carefully disinfect them., Saline solutions contain a mix of salt and water that is specially formulated to match your eyes' natural salt levels. Applying a few drops after swimming without goggles is a great way to flush contaminants out of your eyes, soothe stinging, and reduce the risk of infection. You can usually find bottles of saline solution at pharmacies and grocery stores for fairly cheap.In a pinch, you can also splash your eyes with cool, clean fresh water like you'd get from a bottle or the tap.

, The less you expose your eyes to water, the less you'll irritate them. If opening your eyes all the way is too painful, you may be able to get some underwater vision by simply squinting. You won't be able to see as much, but you will still probably be able to make out vague shapes and outlines, which is better than nothing.

, Like any difficult skill, the best way to learn how to open your eyes underwater without pain is through practice. Start by jumping into your preferred body of water. As noted above, clean fresh water is best — chlorine and salt water hurt more. Keep your eyes closed as you enter the water to prevent water from splashing into them.


If you're wearing contacts, don't forget to take them off before you get in the water.

, Once you're underwater, open your eyes ever-so-slightly. Crack your eyelids open just a little bit until you can see the vague outlines of your surroundings. Maintain this for a second or two. If it's not too uncomfortable, proceed to the next step.


If squinting is too painful, you may be swimming in eye-irritating water (or may just naturally have sensitive eyes). Try the ""controlled environment"" step at the end of this section.

, Now, gradually open your eyelids to their natural ""open"" position. It may be hard to get yourself to do this — it often feels ""wrong,"" like swallowing a pill without water or looking over a high ledge if you're afraid of heights. If you're nervous, go extra-slow to keep your anxiety manageable.


Some people find it easier to open their eyes underwater if they look upward. Try experimenting with pointing your eyes in different directions to find a position that feels best for you.

, If you've ever held your eyes open out of water (like for a staring contest), you probably know that they start to sting after a while even without anything irritating them besides the air. When you're underwater, your eyes will start to sting much more quickly and you'll need to hold them closed for longer than normal to get the stinging to go away. As soon as you feel the first twinges of pain, shut your eyes and hold them closed for a second or two. Your eyelids will re-coat your eyes with a protective layer of tears, reducing the pain.


When the stinging goes away, gradually open your eyes again. Repeat this pattern as you swim underwater to keep the pain under control.

, Everyone's eyes are different. Some people will find it easy to open their eyes underwater, while others may struggle. If you can't seem to get your eyes open, try this gentle practice method until you're more comfortable:


Fill a bowl or sink with clean, clear, warm (not hot) water from the tap.
Lower your face into the water with your eyes closed. It should feel nice. If it's too hot or cold, adjust the temperature.
With your face in the water, gradually open your eyes, squinting at first and then opening them fully. Close your eyes again as soon as they start to sting.
Repeat a few times until you can open your eyes confidently before testing your skills in the pool, at the beach, etc.

Currently, feral hogs are most plentiful in the south, but can be found in 35 states. Because they are so prolific, many believe it's only a matter of time until they are in all of the lower 48., When selecting a firearm to hunt hogs, the most important thing to consider is accuracy. Hogs are tough animals, so if you don't hit a vital organ, they are likely to flee.Also important is the caliber of the weapon. Because hogs are tough, guns that fire larger rounds are usually a superior choice.
The minimum caliber for a hog hunting rifle is the .270 Winchester. A better choice is a .30 caliber rifle such as the .308 or the .300 Winchester Magnum.Other good options include the Browning Automatic Rifle, which comes in a special Hog Stalker model just for hog hunters.Other firearms manufactures also offer specialty hog hunting weapons such as the Savage Hog Hunter and the Weatherby Hog Reaper.You may also wish to consider a silencer, as this will make it harder for hogs to locate you after you've fired, and will also dampen the muzzle flash if you are hunting at night., Once you've found a place to hunt hogs, it's a good idea to scout out the land in advance to find the best places on the property to stalk hogs or set up a stand.


Look for hog droppings or signs that hogs have been rooting (digging) in the area. Land that hogs have rooted on generally looks as though it has been plowed.Hogs like to wallow in mud and shallow ponds, making such areas ideal places to hunt.
Placing motion-activated game cameras around the property is another good way to figure out where hogs gather., Especially if the weather is bad, you might want to hunt hogs from a stand or blind. This is basically a small shed, often raised above the ground, in which you can hide while waiting for hogs.While in the stand, you'll need to stay as quiet as possible so that hogs don't know you are hiding there.
Be prepared to log some hours waiting for hogs to come by. Especially if your stand is not well positioned, you may have to wait all day for a hog.
Using game cameras, you can keep of track of any hogs that might be headed your way, so you can be ready for them if they come.
Placing bait near your stand may increase the possibility that hogs will come by., Many hunters find still-hunting and stalking a more exciting way to hunt hogs, because it keeps you more active and you cover more territory.Still-hunting is moving slowly along through likely cover, looking for an animal to shoot. Stalking is creeping up quietly on an animal you've already located.This approach allows you to cover multiple high-potential locations in a day instead of just one location where you have built a stand.
When actively looking for hogs, you will most likely hear them before you see them. Move slowly and stop every few feet to listen for the sound of hogs.Hogs are somewhat nearsighted and tend to get preoccupied when feeding. Hogs that are eating, then, will be easier to sneak up on., In many states, it is legal to use dogs to track and flush out hogs.Some hunters like this method best because the excitement of dogs can be energizing.To hunt hogs with dogs, you'll need at least two dogs. First, you'll need a ""bay dog"" (or several) who's job it is to find a hog and alert you to its presence by barking. You'll also need a ""catch dog,"" who can meet up with the bay dogs once the hog is cornered, and grab it by the face or ear until you arrive to kill the hog.Bay dogs can be any kind of trained dog with a good sense of smell, catch dogs need to be large, powerful dogs, such as a pit bull or American bull dog.Make sure all your dogs are wearing cut vests to protect their necks and vital organs from the hog.
This type of hunting can be dangerous for dogs. it is a good idea to learn dog first aid and carry some supplies for patching your dogs up, should they be injured.

, You can also buy hog calls, either electronic or mouth-blown, which can in some cases attract nearby hogs.Electronic calls that are programmed with the sounds of piglets in distress are often most effective.

, Once you've found a hog, take aim and shoot it. As mentioned before, hogs are tough, so make sure to shoot at their vital organs, otherwise they may flee.


Shoot for the neck. A bullet anywhere between the shoulder and jaw or ear will usually stop a hog in its tracks.Another good area to shoot is right behind the shoulder. Here you can hit the heart or a lung without damaging choice cuts of meat.Try not to hit a hog's shoulder. Aside from the bone, hog shoulders are covered with an extra-tough hide of scar tissue developed from fighting.Hitting a hog in the shoulder may do little more than scare it away.

, Once you've killed a hog, you'll need to remove several of the organs to get at the meat you want.


Always wear latex gloves when dressing a hog. Hogs can carry swine brucellosis, a disease that can be transmitted to humans.Start by rolling the hog over on its back and spreading its hind legs. Then, cut down the center of the belly from the breast bone to the base of the tail, cutting through the hide and belly muscles but not puncturing the stomach or intestines.Then, roll the hog on its side and pull out the stomach and intestines.
Finally, cut around the diaphragm, then sever the esophagus and windpipe and pull out the heart and lungs, and drain any excess blood.
If the stomach or intestines were shot or punctured, wash out the body cavity with water as soon as possible.Get the meat in a cooler as soon as possible to prevent spoilage.

Check if a machine-wash is safe.,
Prep your bear for a safe wash.,
Run the machine.",How to Clean a Teddy Bear3," Inspect the age and quality of your bear. Also check the materials from which it is made, as well as those that adorn it. Since a machine-wash will be much rougher on the toy than a hand-wash, err on the side of caution and hand-wash it if you determine that your bear might not survive the machine. Do not machine-wash the following:Old teddy bears, those that are delicate by design, and those that have become fragile due to lots of use.
Bears that are made of wool, mohair, alpaca fur, or rayon.
Any with attached add-ons like sequins, buttons, or eyes that have been glued on.

, If your bear has any clothes than can be removed, take them off to prevent tangling and to make sure that the bear itself is washed thoroughly. Trim any loose threads and sew up any tears or holes so the problem doesn’t grow any worse during the wash.Give your bear extra protection by closing it within a sealable pillowcase or mesh bag., First, add an appropriate amount of detergent to your washer. Then set the machine’s cycle to “Hand-Wash” or “Delicate.” Finally, select cold or warm water. Then start the wash cycle.Do not use hot water, since this may ruin the bear.
Do not include items that are excessively dirty or whose colors may bleed in the same wash cycle as your bear.

Get classic with a tuna melt.",How to Make Healthier Sandwiches," Your basic sandwich is generally made with bread, on a roll or in a wrap. If you're going to choose one of these items or something similar, boost the nutrition of your sandwich by choosing whole grains.


Whole grains are a more nutrient-dense and healthier option compared to refined grains (like white bread). They're less processed and contain all the parts of the grain.Whole grains are typically much higher in fiber, minerals and even protein compared to refined grains. Breads high in fiber keep you full longer and therefore helps stop snacking. Snacking can result in overeating, which can contribute to obesity.
If you're going to choose an item like bread, a wrap, English muffin, bagel, flatbread or deli thin, go for 100% whole grains.
Look at the food label to make sure your item is 100% whole grain. The ingredient label should list only 100% whole wheat or 100% whole grain flour.;
, If you want to minimize your bread intake or just try something a little different, consider using a tortilla or a wrap. You can wrap up your sandwich fillings for a quick meal.


Both tortillas and wraps are flat and are not as high in carbohydrates or calories compared to many types of bread or rolls. They're also a little bit less filling since they're just less food overall.Again, choose 100% whole grain if you can. Many corn tortillas are automatically whole grain as well.
Be wary of what size wrap you buy. Many come in 6"", 8"" or even 12"". The bigger they are, the more likely it'll count as two servings of grains. Stick to a 6"" wrap to minimize calories and carbohydrates.

, Many bread companies are jumping on the low calorie, low carbohydrate band wagon by developing ""deli or sandwich thins."" These are rolls or bread that are very thin, low in calories and carbohydrates.


These deli thins are a great substitute for regular bread. Many companies make them in 100% whole grain versions, have added fiber and protein.Sandwich thins are also usually low in calorie as well. Some may only have about 100 calories for both pieces. This may be lower than other breads or rolls you've used in the past.
Again, read the ingredient list to make sure that these products are truly 100% whole grain.

, Another way to add more nutrients (and fewer calories) to your sandwich is by using a lettuce wrap. This is a fun twist on a classic sandwich that can also make it healthier.


Lettuce, like other vegetables, is naturally low in calories. Many lettuces, especially dark greens, are also high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.You use a lettuce wrap just like you would a tortilla. You can place your sandwich fillings and toppings in a large lettuce leaf and roll up.
Not all lettuces are great for wraps, but collard greens, Swiss chard, mustard greens, kale, butter lettuce, or iceberg lettuce all have large leaves that can be rolled.

, If you're overly concerned about calories or carbs, there is one additional method for serving your sandwich. You can try a naked or open-faced sandwich instead of the traditional sandwich.


A naked sandwich is one that doesn't have any bread or wrap. It's just the filling.
For example, you could do turkey and cheese roll ups stuffed with sliced raw vegetables.
An open-faced sandwich is one where you only use a single slice of bread. It cuts down on the calories and carbohydrates that you're consuming. These are especially great for hot sandwiches.
For example, you could make an open-faced tuna melt using only one slice of whole wheat bread.

, Most of the time you make a sandwich, you're most likely going to add some type of sauce, dressing or condiment. It adds a little moisture and extra flavor.


Be mindful of what types and how much of these condiments you add. You could start with a fairly nutritious or low-calorie sandwich and send it overboard with high-calorie or high-fat condiments.Try to choose condiments that are a little lower in calorie. Try mustard, salsa, hot sauce, horseradish, relish, hummus, reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil, or a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar.
Make sure to measure out the appropriate portion size as well. Many are only 1 teaspoon or tablespoon per serving.

, Many sandwich fillings contain some sort of protein. Whether it's peanut butter and jelly or a ham and cheese, protein usually plays an important role; however, many protein options for sandwiches are overly high in sodium.Sandwich fillings that are frequently high in sodium include nut butters, deli meat, bacon, sausage, salami, and frozen veggie patties.
A diet high in sodium can increase your risk for high blood pressure and stroke. Sticking to lower sodium items is better for your health.Instead of traditional deli meat items, try the following lower sodium items: roasted turkey or chicken breast, low-sodium deli meat (look for this on the label) or sliced grilled steak.
Add about 3 – 4 oz of lean protein to your sandwich. This is about one serving and will help keep you satisfied.

, A nice slice of cheese really completes a sandwich. Don't skip it in favor of lower calories. Cheese can also add extra nutrients to your sandwich.


Cheese is part of the dairy food group. It contains a decent amount of calcium, Vitamin D and even has some protein.Whether or not you choose fat-free, reduced fat or full fat cheese is up to you. The calorie difference between these options is minimal. Fat-free cheese is more processed than the full fat, so you may enjoy the flavor of the full-fat.
Make sure to measure the appropriate serving of cheese. Only add one slice or about 1-2 ounces per sandwich.

, An easy way to make any sandwich or wrap a bit healthier is by adding vegetables. They can add a whole host of beneficial nutrients to your meal.Vegetables are great to add to sandwiches. They can add flavor and crunch without many added calories.
In addition, vegetables are high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. Adding just a few to your sandwich can really boost the overall nutritional content.
You can add any type of veggie to your sandwich. It can be as simple as lettuce and tomato or you could a little more fancy with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.
One serving of vegetables is about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens. You probably won't be able to get an entire serving on a sandwich, but aim for about 1/2 serving.

, If you enjoy the traditional BLT, you may also love a BALT — or a BLT that has avocado. It's a simple twist on a classic, but something you're bound to love.


Start by toasting two pieces of 100% whole grain bread. You can also use 100% whole wheat wrap as well.
Spread 1 tablespoon of low-fat, olive oil based mayo on one side of the toast or wrap.
Top with three to four slices of cooked bacon (it should be around 3 oz), two to three leaves of romaine lettuce and one to two thick slices of a ripe tomato.
Last, top with 1/2 of a thinly sliced avocado. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and either roll up your wrap or top with the remaining slice of bread.

, If you're looking for a vegetarian based wrap, try this Mediterranean wrap. It's packed full of vegetables and makes for a great, high-fiber meal.


Start with a 8"" 100% whole wheat wrap. Spread on about 3 – 4 tablespoons of your favorite hummus. Evenly spread the hummus over the entire wrap.
Then top with 1/2 of an avocado that's been sliced very thinly. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper to taste.
Then layer on: 1/4 cup of sliced roasted red peppers, 2 tablespoons of diced black olives, 1/4 cup of thinly sliced cucumbers and 2 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese.
Roll up your wrap tightly. Slice in half and enjoy.

, Cut down on your carbohydrate intake by making spicy salmon lettuce cups. Using sweet, cup-shaped butter lettuce is a great substitute for bread in this recipe.


Start by laying out two leaves of butter lettuce. Try to use the bigger, outer leaves. You can also use iceberg lettuce leaves as well.
Fill each lettuce cup with about 1/3 cup of canned salmon (you can also use tuna in the recipe as well).
Lightly drizzle about 1 teaspoon of your favorite hot sauce on top of each salmon cup. You can add more if you like things more spicy.
Also top each of your salmon cups with about 1/4 cup of pico de gallo, 1 teaspoon fresh cilantro chopped and salt and pepper to taste.

, A warm, cheesy tuna melt is a great sandwich. Keep it portion controlled by using whole wheat English muffins instead of traditional sandwich bread.


Start by separating the halves of a whole wheat English muffin. Toast until your desired doneness.
While your English muffin is toasting, mix together a 3.5 oz can of tuna with 2 tablespoons of low-fat mayo with olive oil, 1 tablespoon of relish, and salt and pepper to taste.
Scoop half of the tuna salad onto one side of the English muffin. Repeat with the remaining tuna salad and English muffin half.
Top each half with 1 tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese. Place under the broiler for about 30 – 60 seconds or until the cheese melts.

Connect the new light and slide it into place.,
Screw the ring back into place.",How to Fix a Burned Out Headlight3," Sealed beam style headlights were common in older model vehicles. These headlights are entirely self-contained and tend to be three to five inches in diameter. Because these headlights need to be pulled out, start by removing any parts of the vehicle’s exterior trim that surrounds the headlights.You may not need to remove any trim components depending on the application.

, In some trucks, you will need to remove all or parts of the grill in order to access the headlight screws and connections. Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle to determine what parts, if any, of the grill you’ll need to remove.If you need to remove the grill, it is usually secured with bolts along the top and a series of clips.
You will need to gain access to the screws that hold the headlight in place. Remove anything you need to in order to reach them.

, Sealed beam style headlights are commonly held in place by a metal of plastic ring that is secured with multiple screws or bolts. Use the appropriate hand tool (screw driver or wrench) to remove each of these fasteners and set them aside somewhere safe.You will need to reuse the fasteners, so be careful not to lose them.
If any of the bolts or screws are severely rusted or damaged, be sure to replace them.

, With the ring removed, grip the headlight with your thumbs and fore fingers and pull it toward you, out of the front of the vehicle. Once the headlight slides out, disconnect the wiring going into the back of it.Depending on the vehicle, there may be a wire pigtail with plastic releases you will need to squeeze to release.
Inspect the disconnected wiring for damage.

, Remove the new light from the package and connect the loose wiring you removed from the previous light. Slide the headlight into place where the old one sat and hold it in place until you can replace the ring that secures it.If the wiring connectors are dirty, spray them with electrical cleaner.
You can purchase electrical cleaner from your local auto parts or electronics store.

, Place the metal or plastic ring back over the headlight and use the fasteners you saved to secure it into place. Once done, return any pieces of the trim or grill you needed to remove.Start the vehicle to test the headlight.
If the headlight does not work, check to ensure the wiring is securely connected and free of damage.

The person may think people are plotting troubles or trying to kill him or her. Any risks of suicide should be taken seriously. If the individual has a personal history of suicidal thoughts or a past suicide attempt, the risk of suicide should be taken seriously. Ask if there’s a family history of suicide.If someone is threatening his or her life, seek immediate care. Take the person to the emergency department or call emergency services.
For more information, check out How to Help Someone Who Is Thinking About Committing Suicide.;
, If the individual is overly distrustful of others, there can be a higher risk of violence. People with paranoid personality symptoms are more likely to have violent personal histories and engage in harmful behaviors.If there is a risk of violence, remove any items that can be used as weapons. These include guns, knives, or other dangerous objects from the house.
If safety is a major concern and other people feel unsafe, bring the individual to the emergency department.

, If symptoms are severe, psychiatric hospitalization may be necessary. Hospitalization may be needed if the individual cannot care for himself or herself (such as not taking care of basic hygiene, paying bills, or showing up for work). Hospitalization may also be necessary if the person is a threat to the self or others, such as threatening suicide or homicide.Once major symptoms are treated, the person may be moved to a day treatment program, residential program, or outpatient treatment.

, It’s important to find a treatment team with individuals who all have familiarity with personality disorders. Because personality disorders are ongoing, it’s important to work with several professionals as part of the treatment team. The treatment team can include a primary medical doctor, a therapist/psychologist, psychiatrist, pharmacist, social worker, and family members.Having a treatment team means that all of people work together to provide treatment.
Someone with paranoid personality disorder may become suspicious of working with several professionals. Communicate each person’s role and why it’s important to have a team.

, Psychotherapy is an important part of treating personality disorders.Treatment for paranoid personality disorder can be difficult because the person may be distrustful of others, which can extend to a therapist. However, ongoing treatment can be effective.It’s important that the individual feels comfortable in therapy and does not feel suspicious of the therapist.


Find a therapist who is supportive and that the individual feels he or she can trust. Seek a therapist with a reputation in treating personality disorders.

, People with paranoid personality disorder often quit therapy too early. The person may begin to have suspicions of the therapist and end sessions abruptly.If the person does begin to distrust the therapist, the therapist must be careful in his or her response and not challenge the beliefs harshly. When therapy is abruptly stopped, symptoms can pop up again or may be ongoing.


Create trust and openness in the beginning stages of therapy. A collaborative relationship is important for therapy to be effective., Generally, medications are not recommended as they can encourage suspicions of being poisoned or mind-controlled. If medications are used, they should be brief to manage severe symptoms.It’s important to discuss medication use with the treatment team and to monitor thoughts and feelings around medications.


Sometimes people may be prescribed an antianxiety medication if the paranoia causes severe anxiety and/or agitation. Antipsychotic medications may also be prescribed for treating delusional thoughts that may cause harm to the self or others., A paranoid person is always on guard against perceived danger. This kind of alertness and suspicion can cause extreme distress. While it may be difficult to convince the individual that no danger exists, it’s possible to reduce the distress from the beliefs. Symptoms of distress can include increased irritability, agitation, emotional guardedness, and sometimes hostility.One way to lower stress is to practice relaxation techniques. Relaxation can include progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and deep breathing.
Other ways to reduce stress include exercising and challenging negative thoughts.The person can learn to talk about his or her distress instead of acting out in unhelpful strategies such as shunning others., People with paranoid personality disorder may socially isolate themselves due to their beliefs, inappropriate social interactions, and poor social skills.Isolation can increase symptoms, which is why it’s important for the person to be connected with others. Encourage the person to find a social hobby (such as playing board games or joining a group exercise class) or spend time with family.


If adult interactions are difficult, the person can spend time with nieces and nephews or other family members. Activities can be supervised if necessary.
Adopting a pet is another option, as long as the person can be responsible to care for an animal. Dogs in particular provide companionship, aid in physical health, and help to reduce anxiety., People with paranoid personality disorder may lack social skills and act awkwardly in social situations.They may be so involved in their paranoia that they miss opportunities to converse normally with others. Surround the person with other people who are willing to have normal conversations and approach the person nonjudgmentally.


Therapy can help focus social discussions away from talking about paranoia and into more normal topics of conversation.

, It’s important for the individual to learn to accept and understand his or her own feelings of vulnerability. Provide opportunities for the person to recognize and expand his or her perception of self-worth.These self-awareness techniques can help the person identify his or her own feelings and react to emotional experience differently. If you are a good friend or family member, gently bring the person’s awareness to thoughts and feelings.


Emotional labeling can be helpful. Say, “It seems like you’re feeling sad today” or, “I’m noticing you seem more upset today.”
Therapy can be helpful in raising self-awareness. A therapist can help to build skills in awareness and help the person to practice these skills.

, If you are the caregiver for someone who has PPD, then it is important for you to get the support and care that you need. Caring for a loved one with PPD can be incredibly stressful and time consuming, which may result in you neglecting your own needs. Make your self-care a priority and reach out to other people for help and support.

Talk to friends and family members about your situation and ask for help. This might be in the form of giving you a day off or simply coming over for an hour so you can do self-care activities like taking a bath, styling your hair, or taking a nap.
Look into caregiver support groups. Ask your doctor about support groups for caregivers in your area, or check online to connect with people who are in similar situations.
Find a therapist for yourself. If you are struggling to cope with your emotions or if you just need someone to talk to, then it might be a good idea for you to find a therapist for yourself.

Remember that for better or worse, people tend to judge others based on first impressions.,
Smile and project a positive attitude.,
Quickly choose someone to approach and talk to.,
Start the conversation.,
Keep the conversation going.,
Be a good listener.,
Okay, it's been 60 seconds.",How to Create a Friendship in 60 Seconds," This is just a fact of life.


Pay attention to your personal hygiene (shower, brush your teeth, check your breath) and dress attractively.
You don't have to be fancy or overdressed; just avoid looking too sloppy or unwashed.

,


A smile is kind of a universal sign that you're friendly and your intentions are good. It also suggests that you have a positive personality, which is appealing to most people.
If you have trouble smiling naturally, try thinking of something that makes you happy.

, Be sure not to choose some random stranger, just make sure that you known them the least bit and at least know their name.


Don't agonize over this – the point is to talk to as many people as possible in a social setting to increase your chances of making a new friend.
Don't choose people based on their ""attractiveness,"" or on how ""confident"" they appear. Your new best friend may not fit either of those descriptions, but may still be a fantastic person. So just approach anyone who looks available for a conversation. If the conversation doesn't pan out, you can always move on with no guilt (see below).
Put yourself at ease by remembering that the people around you are probably as interested in making new friends as you are.

, Look, you approached this person, so logically it's up to you to start the ball rolling. Almost any opening remark can start a productive conversation.

If the two of you happen to have anything in common, start with that. For example, ""Hey, I think I've seen you in my biology class – how do you like that teacher?"" Or, ""Do you work at Starbucks? I think I've seen you there.""
Give the person a compliment that leads to a question: ""Wow, that's a really nice bracelet – where did you get it?"" Or maybe, ""Your hair looks amazing – how do you get it to do that?""
Go with the age-old standby – the weather. If it's hot, say you're burning up and you need to sit down for a minute. If it's raining, say you'd been planning to go shopping (or biking, or sightseeing, or something else interesting), but now you might be changing your plans.

, Unless the person is disastrously insecure or just not in the mood to talk (it happens), your opening line will get some kind of response. Be prepared to follow up with additional remarks.


Try to retain interesting bits of information from reading books, magazines and newspapers, watching TV and surfing the Web. These can be life-savers in a conversation.
Talk about yourself and gradually share more information as the conversation progresses.

, This is one of the main things that people respond to when meeting someone new – when you give someone your attention, you make that person feel important and worthwhile.

Make eye contact – the best way to show that you're tuned in. Don't stare into space or look at other people, and definitely don't look at your phone!
When the person makes a statement or relates a story, give a response that expands on the topic or otherwise shows that you understand.

, Did you make a connection?


If no, that's okay. You won't strike gold every time, and people aren't always in the mood to be social, so you shouldn't feel discouraged. All you have to do is politely disengage yourself (""Hey, thanks for chatting. I should get going – talk to you later!"") and then find a new person to approach.
If yes, great! Keep talking for as long as it's comfortable, and then when it's time to go, be sure to exchange phone numbers and/or email addresses so you can stay in touch. Then be sure to follow up. This may not turn into the friendship of a lifetime, but you'll only find out by taking the initiative and contacting the person to talk or hang out again.

Figure out what type of face skin you have.,
Wash your hands first.,
Wash your face twice a day with lukewarm water and a gentle cleanser.Even if your skin looks clean, it’s probably not.,
Find out if exfoliation is right for your skin.,
Rinse your face thoroughly after cleansing or exfoliating.,
Pat your face dry with a clean, soft cloth.Never dry your skin with a dirty hand towel in the bathroom or the same towel you use to dry off your body; you will just transfer new, fresh bacteria onto your clean face.,
Moisturize your face.,
Shower or bathe every day using warm-to-hot water.,
Cleanse your body in the shower or bath safely.,
Exfoliate your body once a week, focusing on acne-prone areas.Since the skin on your body produces more sweat and oil than the skin on your face, you may want to invest in a body scrub to use at least once a week.,
Pat your body dry with a clean towel and apply lotion.,
Wash your hands well and wash them often.,
Use warm water and a mild soap.,
Clean all the surfaces of your hands.,
Pat dry with a clean towel or fresh paper towel.,
Moisturize your hands as needed.",How to Clean Your Skin," Your skin changes as you age, especially during puberty, and looking for products in the skincare aisle at the drugstore can be confusing. There are so many options! Which should you choose? To find the right cleanser for your skin, it is important to first determine your current skin type:Normal skin is not too oily and not too dry, with minimal blemishes and no severe sensitivity to products or weather.
Oily skin often appears shiny or greasy, even if you recently washed your face. Oily skin is also prone to blemishes and larger pores.
Dry skin is often flaky, with more visible lines and some reddish patches of skin.
Sensitive skin is often mistaken for dry skin because it typically appears dry and red; however, the difference is that sensitive skin is often a result of a particular ingredient in a skin care product.
Combination skin is when you have patches of skin that are oily in some areas and dry or normal in others. Combination skin is typically oily around the T-zone (the T-shaped area created by your forehead, nose, and chin) and normal to dry on the rest of the face.;
, Before you start cleansing the skin on your face, be sure to wash your hands with warm water and soap to kill all the germs and remove dirt and grime. You wouldn’t want to rub more germs all over your face, would you?

, It is very important to cleanse your face every morning and every night before bed, especially if you wear makeup or are prone to breakouts. Keep in mind:Don’t use water that is extremely hot or extremely cold since this can damage your skin and trap grease and dirt inside your pores.

Gently massage your face with slow, circular motions. Don't scrub! Scrubbing will cause skin irritation, redness, or breakouts.
Treat the skin around your eyes extra gently, as it is the most delicate, sensitive skin on your face. Plus you don’t want to end up with cleanser in your eyes!
Don’t over-wash your face! Even if you have oily skin, over-washing can cause dryness, and your skin will produce more oil to compensate, which means you could end up with oilier, more blemished skin.

, For some skin types and conditions, exfoliating can be helpful, such as those with sun damage. However, for other skin types, such as those with cystic acne, exfoliating can damage your skin. Check with a dermatologist to be sure if exfoliating is right for you.Choose a scrub that’s designed for your skin type and that is not too harsh. Some varieties include:


Mild scrubs containing beads, sugar, salt or other types of natural exfoliators.
Soft skincare brushes. These can be manual or oscillating brushes that you squeeze your cleanser or a mild scrub into before gently rubbing the brush on your face.
Treatment masks that include mild acids like alpha-hydroxy acid or beta-hydroxy acid to slough off dead skin. Be very careful with this option and be sure to read the directions!

, Using lukewarm water, gently rinse the cleanser from your face either with a clean washcloth or by cupping your hands under the sink and carefully splashing water onto your face.Be sure all of the cleanser is removed, as any remaining cleanser can clog your pores and cause irritation and blemishes., Also, it is important to pat, not rub, your face dry in order to treat the skin as gently as possible.

, Apply moisturizer to your face after you dry it off.Many people skip this step, but applying a moisturizer designed for your particular skin type is very important post-cleansing. Moisturizers seal in the existing water in your skin so it doesn’t evaporate, which dries out your skin. You may need more moisturizer, or a thicker moisturizer, during the winter months.

, In addition to removing dirt and oil that can cause body acne, showering or bathing once a day will help wash away the bacteria that causes body odor.While very hot water should be avoided because it strips the skin of important oils, use warmer water when cleaning your body than you would on your face in order to kill the bacteria.

, As with cleaning your face, it is important that your hands and the products you use to clean your body are hygienic. Bar soap and body wash are sanitary, but loofahs, scrubbers, and washcloths, especially ones that are shared, are not. Be sure every member in your house only uses their own products and wash or replace these regularly!, Using a clean washcloth or loofah, focus your gentle, circular motions on areas that are prone to breakouts, like the chest, neck, and back.


Don't exfoliate too much because this can make body acne worse and irritate your skin., The skin on your body is less delicate than your face, but it is still important to only use a clean towel to dry off. Stay in the humid, steamy bathroom and towel off until you are only a bit damp, and then apply moisturizer to your entire body before exiting.The steam helps with long-lasting hydration because the moisturizer sinks into your pores while they are still open.

, Cleaning the skin on your hands multiple times a day is extremely important for your health and for the health of others. Germs are everywhere, and some can make people very sick so it is important to wash your hands often, but especially:After using the bathroom or changing a diaper
After playing outside
Before and after visiting anyone who is sick
After blowing your nose or coughing, especially if you are sick
Before eating, serving, or helping to make any food
If your hands look dirty

, You can use an antibacterial soap if you prefer, but regular soap will work just as well. Just be sure to use soap every time you wash your hands! Rinsing with water might make your hands look clean, but they will still be covered in germs. This is important to do whether you are in a public restroom or at home, as germs and bacteria are everywhere., Don’t just cup the soap in your hand and pass it back and forth between your palms. To really clean the skin on your hands, it is important to lather the soap onto both sides of the hands, in-between the fingers, under and around the nails, and up onto your wrists. You should do this for at least 20 seconds., If you are at home or a friend’s house, be sure the hand towel is clean. If you are using a public restroom, use the paper towel to dry off your hands and then, still using the towel and not your bare hand, open the door and throw the towel away outside of the bathroom. A shocking number of people don’t wash their hands after using the bathroom, and those handles collect a lot of germs., The skin on your hands might not need to be moisturized after every hand washing, but they can get chapped just like any other type of skin post-cleansing. Try carrying around a small tube of hand-specific moisturizer, which tend to be less greasy and sink in faster than other moisturizers, so you can keep your hands clean and soft.

Take care of your appearance.,
You can't go wrong by wearing jeans.,
Start working out.,
Get some scars.",How to Be Macho4," A macho guy should perform basic grooming on himself without spending too much time or money on his appearance. To look macho, you need to be clean, smell good, and dress appropriately, but not look like you spent more than 5 minutes getting ready in the morning, or that you care about your appearance.

Skip things like manicures and expensive haircuts. Instead, learn to trim your own neckline and beard with a trimmer to keep yourself looking good between basic cuts. Trim and clean your fingernails regularly, but don't worry about your cuticles.






Shower and wear clean clothes that fit appropriately and highlight your masculine physique. There's nothing macho about stinking and wearing the clothes a teenager wears. Learn to dress yourself.







, What does a macho guy wear? The simpler, the better. A basic look that features any style of jeans, a clean white t-shirt, and work boots looked good in the 1950s and it still looks cool today.


Dress appropriately for work. Don't wear flip-flops and board shorts to your job, or you risk looking like a chump. Get a solid pair of shoes or boots and get the job done., A macho guy has a macho physique, probably not from spending time at some expensive gym doing pilates, but from lifting heavy stuff in his garage. Develop a muscle-building routine that you can do at home with materials you already have. You don't need to buy expensive weight equipment or trendy gear. Barbells will do the trick.


Focus on your abs and biceps above all other muscle groups. Do sit-ups of different varieties and at different angles to build your six-pack muscles and perform bicep curls and bench presses to work on your chest and arms.

, A macho guy gets his hands dirty and leads a physical life that will probably result in some dings and dents in the ol' dude. Don't worry about it. Embrace activities that you know you can handle, and be adventurous. You only live once.


This doesn't mean that you should be irresponsible and put yourself at risk. Get scars because you dirt-bike and work on your car, not because you get into bar fights or drive like an idiot.

Pre-planning: Make a “pre-conception” appointment with your OBGYN or Midwife.,
On the first day of your pregnancy cycle, throw out birth control, if applicable.,
On the second day of your pregnancy cycle, start BBT charting.,
On the third day of your pregnancy cycle,if you opted to buy the first response fertility test, this is the day to take it.,
About on the fifth day of your pregnancy cycle, start charting your cervical mucus Do this daily until the doctor confirms conception.,
About on the fourteenth day of your pregnancy cycle, start taking OPKs daily starting on or about the days that FF predicts you are fertile.,
About on the twentieth day of your pregnancy cycle, you likely noticed a slight rise in your temperature around the time of ovulation.,
About on the twenty-eighth day of your pregnancy cycle, expect Aunt Flo any time now.,
In the second cycle of your pregnancy and on this cycle's first day, continue charting menses and BBT, and taking all supplements.",How to Get Pregnant in 90 Days or Less," Check with your doctor to ensure that the following supplements and tools are right for you as you would not want any adverse effects. Ask for a prescription for prenatal vitamins or ask your doctor to recommend a good over the counter brand. Have IUD or other birth control device removed (if applicable, in not continue to cycle day 1).;
, Go shopping for the items listed in ""things you will need."" Start taking all daily supplements immediately (except for Guaifenesin until further notice). Stop all use of caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and non-medically necessary drugs. Time to put away the hot tub, if you have one. It decreases fertility in men and they cannot be used by women during pregnancy anyway.

, Set an alarm and wake up the same time every day and take your temp. Do not move or get out of bed until the thermometer has registered the temp (make sure to get at least 3, but preferably 6 hours of sleep before taking BBT).

, Follow the directions on the packaging.

, (Note: shortly after your period it will be extremely dry or non-existent; more information about charting CM at http://infertility.about.com/od/tryingtoconceive101/a/cervicalmucus.htm)

, Continue to check your cervical mucus. When it is clear and stretches between your fingers (like egg white) it is your most fertile mucus. Be sure to have sex on the days you have EWCM (Egg White Cervical Mucus) as well as on the day you get a positive OPK. Start taking Guaifenesin (200 mg 3x per day), and start doing the horizontal hula (missionary or doggy style positions are best for depositing the sperm closest to the cervix). Avoid using lubricants or saliva as these can both inhibit or kill sperm (if you must use a lubricant try actual egg whites or PreSeed). Also avoid oral sex because of the same issues with saliva. If you can, make sure she orgasms during or after ejaculation, as there is some proof that a woman’s orgasm can help ferry the sperm along through the cervix. Do this daily during suspected fertile days for the first cycle. You should lie down with your hips elevated for at least 20 mins after sex. If conception does not occur during the first cycle try switching to sex every other day, but being careful to have sex on the day of EWCM and positive OPK.

, If the temperature has remained high there is a possibility that you are pregnant, if not there is still a possibility, but you should probably expect to see aunt Flo around her regularly scheduled visitation time.

, If there is no sign of her after your expected cycle days three or four, take a home pregnancy test and hope for the best.

, At end of menses continue steps starting at CD 5 and follow instructions through CD 28. Repeat for cycle 3.

In addition, relevant safety measures should be reviewed before each experiment.If you are unsure about a specific process, ask your teacher so that you will know exactly what to do.;
, Immediately after a spill or breakage occurs, it must be reported to your teacher. No matter how small it may seem, your teacher needs to know so that the proper cleanup procedure can be followed.Broken glass can have sharp edges that can lead to cuts so handle it with care. It must be disposed of in a special broken glass container.
Never try to clean up a chemical spill without consulting your teacher first.

, Do not wear bulky clothing as this will be difficult to manage and may come into contact with a flame or chemicals. Roll up your sleeves and keep long hair tied back. Wear shoes that are closed-toe, low heeled, and cover your entire foot.Wear clothes that cover your whole body, such as long pants or a long skirt.
Jewelry and contacts should not be worn in the lab., When working in a science lab, you must always wear a lab coat, gloves, and protective eyewear. The lab coat will protect you from chemical spills and gloves will protect your hands when handling chemicals or bacteria.Eyewear should cover both your eyes and the sides of your eyes to protect from splashes.
Disposable gloves of latex or nitrile should be used and removed before leaving the lab.

Make sure you're asking for the right reasons.,
Ask.",How to Discreetly Find out if Someone You Know Is Gay3," There are some very valid reasons for wanting know if someone you know is gay, and there are some not-so-valid reasons. If you want to know if that person is gay, then it should be because you are close to that person and want to show that person that you fully support him being gay and that you want to be there for him or her.


If you're not that close to the person and are just curious, then leave it alone.
If you're wondering if your straight friend's significant other is gay, then you should leave it alone, too. It's not any of your business, unless you really have serious reasons to suspect this person is gay and are worried about your friend.
If you genuinely love and care about that person, and consider that person a close and dear friend, then you can ask if you really want to know. But remember that the person just might not be ready to come out -- it has nothing to do with you.

, If you really want to know, find a time when you can be alone with the person, and tell the person that you really care about him no matter what, and ask if he has anything to tell you. If he doesn't, then calmly ask if he might be gay, and say that you only want to know because you want to support him and you want him to be open with you.


Remember that this most likely will not work. The person has good reasons for not coming out to you if he is gay, and it's not likely that you can force someone out of the closet.
If the person does admit that he's gay and just needed help coming out, then continue to tell him how much you care about him and that you're there for him 100%. If you're the first person to make the person acknowledge his sexual orientation, then you've made a big step and better be prepared to stay by your friend's side.

Write down your problem.,
Find the conversion for one unit.,
Multiply your number by the conversion fraction.,
Cancel out your units.,
Multiply with another conversion fraction the same way.,
Cancel units.,
Repeat until the conversion is done.",How to Convert Units2," Figure out exactly what the problem is asking, and write it as a math problem. Here's an example:


If a bicycle is moving 10 miles per hour, how many feet does it travel in one minute?
Write this as ""10 miles / hour = ? feet / minute"" or ""10 miles / h = ? ft / min"".

, Remember, you can only convert between two units that measure the same thing. In our example, we have units that measure length (miles and feet), and units that measure time (hours and minutes). Start with one pair and find the conversion between them.


For example, 1 mile = 5,280 feet.


, Just as describe in the section above, we can write the conversion as a fraction to cancel out units. Make sure to include every unit in your calculations.


10 miles / h) x 5280 ft / mile
= 52800 miles x ft / h x miles

, One of your units should be on the top and the bottom, so you can cancel them. You aren't done yet, but you're getting closer.


52800 miles x ft / h x miles
= 52800 ft / h

, Choose a unit that hasn't been converted, and write down the conversion as a fraction. Remember to arrange the fraction so the units will cancel out during multiplication.


In our example, we still need to convert hours to minutes. 1 hour = 60 minutes.
Right now, we have 52800 ft / h. Since hours (h) is on the bottom, we want our new fraction to have hours on top: 1 hour / 60 minutes.
52800 ft / h x 1 h / 60 min
= 880 ft x h / h x min


, Another unit should cancel out, just as it did before.


880 ft x h / h x min
= 880 ft / min


, If your answer is in the units you were trying to convert to, you're done with the problem. If you're not there yet, convert another unit with the same method.


Once you're used to this method, you can write all the conversions on one line.For example, we could solve our example problem like this:
10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min
=10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min

= 10 x 5280 ft x 1/60 min

= 880 ft / min.

Parents like to see that young adults are approaching their life choices in a mature manner and nothing will do that better than doing your homework.

,
Think about what other careers you may be able to do with acting skills if you don't make it as the kind of actor you wish to be.,
Research what you will need to do to achieve your goal.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Act4,", For example sales, publicity and marketing positions often require the same kinds of skills. Showing your parents you have sensibly considered an ""escape route"" if things don't work out should impress them with your mature sensible nature.

, For example:


Research and price acting schools. Each school will have its own style and, more importantly, its own placement rates in various acting careers. Find and choose the one that is right for you.
Honestly evaluate your talent and find areas you are lacking. Perhaps you need to be a better dancer dancer, or singer, or tell better jokes. If these skills are a part of your plan, figure out how you will learn the skills.

Call 911.",How to Treat a Stingray Sting," Although alarming and quite painful, stingray wounds are rarely fatal.In fact, most fatalities caused by stingrays are not due to venom intoxication but rather from internal organ injury (if stung in the chest or abdomen), excess blood loss, allergic reaction, or secondary infection. These complications can be managed by trained medical personnel if they occur.;
, Take a brief moment to identify what your symptoms are. Common symptoms include:Pain
Swelling
Bleeding
Weakness
Headache
Muscle cramps
Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
Dizziness/Lightheadedness
Palpitations
Difficulty breathing
Fainting

, Medically speaking, certain symptoms are more serious than others. Determine if you are developing an allergic reaction, suffering from excess blood loss, or experiencing venom intoxication. The presence of these symptoms should trigger seeking immediate medical attention.



Allergic reaction: Swelling of tongue, lips, head, neck, or other body parts; difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing; red and/or itchy rash; fainting or loss of consciousness.

Excess blood loss: Dizziness, fainting or loss of consciousness, sweating, elevated heart rate, decreased blood pressure, rapid breathing.

Venom intoxication: Headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, muscle cramps, seizures.

, Depending on the severity of your symptoms, obtain the medical care/supplies that is most appropriate for you. This may range from obtaining a first-aid kit, visiting the local medic unit, or calling 911 for an ambulance.


Whenever in doubt, always choose a higher-level of care (i.e. calling 911).

, While still in the water, irrigate the wound with sea water, removing all debris and foreign bodies from the affected area. Use tweezers from a first-aid kit if necessary. Once the area is thoroughly irrigated and all foreign bodies are removed, come out from the water and dry the area off with a clean towel, taking care not to injure yourself further.



DO NOT remove any penetrating debris from neck, chest, or abdomen.

, Bleeding is common after a sting. As always, the best way to stop bleeding is by applying direct pressure at the source or slightly above the source with one finger for a few minutes. The longer the pressure is held, the more likely the bleeding will subside.


Try using hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with holding pressure to help stop bleeding if you cannot control it with direct pressure alone. Careful, hydrogen peroxide may sting!

, You can combine this step with the previous step of applying direct pressure to control bleeding. Soaking the wound in hot water helps alleviate the pain by denaturing the venom protein complex. Optimal temperature is 45°C (113°F), but be certain not to cause any burns. Leave the wound soaking for 30 – 90 minutes, or until the pain has subsided., Proper wound care includes keeping the area clean by applying soap and rinsing with water as well as keeping the wound dry at all times. Keep the wound uncovered and apply antibiotic ointment daily. Avoid non-antibiotic creams, lotions, and ointments.


Over the next several days, if the area becomes red, tender, itchy, sore, or begins to swell or develop a cloudy discharge, seek medical attention at the local urgent care center or emergency room. You may need antibiotics and/or drainage of an abscess.

, Depending on where you are, a first-aid kit should be easily accessible. Ask someone to grab it for you while you begin identifying your symptoms and treating your wound. Items found in the first-aid kit that will be most useful to you include:Gauze
Wound cleanser (hydrogen peroxide, alcohol wipe, soap)
Tweezers
Pain killer
Antibiotic ointment
Band-aid

, Having a healthcare provider evaluate and treat your wound(s) is not a bad idea. Not only will you be treated by an experienced professional, you will also reduce your chances of infection and other complications. A treatment plan with instructions and recommendations will be provided to you based on the provider's assessment.


If the closest facility requires at least a 10 minute drive, you should first obtain a first-aid kit and control any bleeding before transporting.

, This is your safety net. Call 911 in any of the following situations:


Penetrating wound to head, neck, chest, or abdomen.
No access to a first-aid kit or medic station.
Symptoms of allergic reaction, excess blood loss, or venom intoxication.
History of prior medical conditions and/or medication use that may influence the wound treatment.
When in doubt, confused, inebriated, obtunded, insecure, scared, or anything else you can think of.

Take your cat outside on a leash.,
Give your cat access to a screened in porch.,
Install a cat door.",How to Give Your Cat Space to Sunbathe2," You can also provide your cat with space to sunbathe by taking them outside on a leash. It is relatively easy to leash train a cat. Try tethering your cat to a stationary object, such as a tree in your backyard. Your cat can enjoy sunbathing outside while you complete yard work or relax outside.Do not leave your cat tethered outside unsupervised because they may get caught or tangled.

, Screened porches will allow your cat to experience an outdoor environment in a controlled and safe space. For instance, a screened in porch will have plenty of natural sunlight for your cat to sunbathe. It will also allow your cat to hear and smell the outdoors, which is stimulating., If your cat spends some time outdoors, then you could install a cat door so that your cat can easily leave the house. This will allow your cat to find a space to sunbathe outside, if desired.You could also create a “catio” or cat run in your backyard that is fully enclosed and connected to the house through a cat door.

Mix and match your major and minor pentatonic scales, all in the same key, for the subtle country sound.,
Use both scales simultaneously for the country/western sound.,
Use your ""minor thirds"" to transition from one scale to the other.,
Use mixed notes, like the minor third, to transition between scales.",How to Play Country Lead Guitar1," The pentatonic scales, which remove the 2nd and 5th notes from normal major and minor scales, is tailor-made for the speed and rocking sound found in most forms of popular music. Review these two scales to the point where you can play them up and down, individually, with ease. You'll get to blending later.










A-Major Pentatonic:

e|---------------------5-7-------------|
B|-----------------5-7-----------------
G|-------------4-6---------------------|
D|---------4-7-------------------------|
A|-----4-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-7---------------------------------|



A-Minor Blues Pentatonic:

e|---------------------5-8-------------|
B|-----------------5-8-----------------
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|;
, If you're in the key of A, you want both the A-major pentatonic and the A-minor pentatonic, as the combination leads to country's unique, blues-inspired sound. While the rest of the article concerns how to transition quickly, you should practice on your own with your favorite country song -- how can you use them to get the sound you want?








, This is easiest to see on the 1st string, 8th fret-- the last note of the A-minor pentatonic scale. The next fret after, the 9th, is the exact same note as the 4th note of the major scale -- providing a great transition point. Bending or sliding into it from either direction is a good way to shift into the other scale. You can also play the identical fret on the low-E (6th) string as well to help transition.









There is another minor third on the 3rd string, 5th fret.
These bends like to ""resolve"" on the root note, meaning they finish on the nearest A (for example, the 1st string, 5th fret).

, Use the example in the video above to see this in action. Any notes where the scales overlap, or can be bent or slid into a note in the opposite scale, are fair game. It is these transition-like notes, when used sparingly, that give the country sound.

Take care of yourself.",How to Deal With Your Child Being Expelled From School," Whether you’ve just gotten the news or are about to attend a meeting, remaining calm will help you problem-solve and approach the situation with a clear head. You might instantly take your child’s side or feel like their expulsion is a reflection of you. If you get a phone call or have a meeting with the school, do your best to be calm throughout.If you notice you’re feeling upset and need to calm, take some deep breaths. Breathe from your diaphragm and lengthen each of your breaths until you feel more calm and centered.;
, Start by asking both your child and the school district about what happened. Ask who was involved, what happened, and the timeline of events. Get as much information as you can from as many perspectives as possible. Don't be afraid to ask for a meeting or call back later for more information. This is your child's future.It’s normal for stories to not entirely match up and for blame to be placed, but get as clear of a picture as you can.
Be willing to hear both sides without judgment or interruption. There’s probably at least hints of truth in all stories.

, The school deals with your child as a student, but you deal with them as a parent. While an expulsion is a large academic consequence, you may wish to have consequences for your child’s behavior at home, too. Think about what’s appropriate for your child’s behavior.An expulsion shouldn’t be a holiday for your child. You may want to take away their privileges (like a phone or television) or tighten the reigns on their freedoms with friends.

, You and your child have the right to know why they are being expelled and what they are accused of. You also have the right to know the evidence collected. Both you and your child have the right to be heard.If the expulsion is more than 10 school days, a formal due process must occur with the school board.
At the hearing, your child has the right to tell their side of the story. They also have the right to have the decision made by someone who is impartial and not invested in the outcome., You may seek legal counsel regarding your child’s expulsion. A lawyer can familiarize you and your child with your rights and recommend some directions to take. The lawyer can come with you and advise you and your child during the school board hearing.Having an attorney present at the school board meeting can help you formulate questions and seek fair treatment.

, Your child’s school should give you a date, time, and place of the hearing. You may wish to learn about the process of the hearing and what will happen during it, including who will speak and what will be discussed. You can bring a letter or plan to speak during the hearing.You should be able to review the school records before the hearing.

, You always have the right to appeal. However, appeals are very rarely successful. Make sure you have a very solid reason why you think this is a misunderstanding or an overstep. Otherwise, dragging out the process can be grueling and not lead to anything beneficial.


An appeal would happen at the child’s expulsion hearing or shortly after.

, If your child is expelled and not welcome to return to the same school, you will need to come up with some options for their education. The school district should give you some suggestions on what to do next, but you can also create a plan on your own. Your options include going to a different public school, attending an alternative school, attending a private school, or homeschooling.Private schools might be boarding schools or day schools. This might include military schools, religious schools, or therapeutic schools.Homeschooling can help kids who are having social problems. If your child got mixed in with a questionable crowd, homeschooling can be a good option. Your child can even complete on-line schooling.

, Some schools allow for re-entry after a child has completed steps to readmission. This might include attending anger management or behavior therapy, substance abuse treatment, or completing community service. Someone from the school board may check up on the progress of the re-entry plan every three months.Once the re-entry plan has been completed, your child may go before the board once again. They board will vote whether your child will be re-admitted.

, This is where your role of parent comes in, especially if the problems at school are behavioral. Let your child know when their behavior is inappropriate and that they need to make some changes. It might be helpful for you to enforce some new rules in your home or enforce consequences in a different way if what you’ve been doing hasn’t been working.

Write down your house rules (along with consequences) and put them in a visible place.
For example, have your child tell you each time they spend with friends, where they are going, and who they will be with. If plans change, have them call you on their phone. If they don’t do these things, then you will ground them or take away their computer privileges.

, Your child’s extreme behavior might be a wake-up call for you that they need help or intervention. Therapy can help your child build skills and create positive behaviors. Your child might learn mindfulness skills which can help them make better decisions and cope with stress in more effective ways.Therapy shouldn’t feel like a punishment to your child or a consequence for their bad behavior.

, Residential treatment is for children and teens who have behavioral or mental health issues that need more attention outside of traditional weekly therapy. Here, your child will get specialized medical and psychological treatment in a safe, structured environment. Treatment lasts from one to several months and often includes the parents and family.While residential treatment isn’t a long-term schooling solution for education, children can still get school credits while at residential treatment as they work toward improving their behavior.

, Your time and attention may be focused on your child during this time, but make sure you’re taking care of yourself, too. Have someone to talk to, like a partner, friend, or another parent who understands. Even if they can’t solve your problems, it can be helpful to talk about it and what you’re going through.Do things for yourself that make you feel supported and taken care of. Take a bath, go on a walk, write in a journal, or listen to calm music.

Perform warm up stretches before you play tennis or golf.,
Do squeeze and release exercises.,
Try wrist rolls and wrist flexes.,
Perform a standing stretch.,
Try side plank.",How to Avoid Tennis Elbow1," To prevent tennis elbow, you should get in the habit of doing 15 minutes of warm up stretches before you play tennis or golf. Warming up your arms with stretches will help to prevent injury and ensure your forearms stay strong. Strong forearms will lower your risk of developing tennis elbow, especially if you tend to do a lot of repetitive motions with your arm playing a sport.Doing warm up stretches before you do any other activities that are hard on your arms, such as gardening, lifting heavy boxes or items, or doing manual labor, can also help to prevent tennis elbow.;
, You can do this simple exercise with a fresh tennis ball or a hard stress ball. Grip the tennis ball in your hand and hold it out in front of you. Then, squeeze and release the tennis ball for two-three minutes, squeezing and releasing the ball in your grip.Do this on both arms as part of your warm up before playing tennis or golf.
You can also do these exercises on your days off from playing tennis or golf, one to two times a day for two-three minutes on each side.

, Doing wrist exercises can help to strengthen your forearm muscles and prevent tennis elbow. You can do these exercises when you are seated at your desk at work, on the court before a game, or at home.To do wrist rolls, make a fist with your elbow bent at your side. Then, make circles with your wrist, about five circles in each direction. Straighten your elbow and do five more circles with your wrist. Repeat this on the other side.
To do wrist flex stretches, hold your arm out, palm down. Use your other hand to gently bend back the hand of the extended arm. Press down so your fingers are facing the ground. You should feel a light stretch along your forearm, but no pain. Hold this for two to three minutes and then repeat it on the other hand.

, You can also integrate a simple standing stretch into your warm up routine. You can also do this stretch before or after you are gardening or lifting heavy objects to prevent tennis elbow.


Do standing shoulder blade squeezes against a wall or on the floor. Hold your arms over your head and interlace your fingers. Press your fingers up towards the ceiling, keeping your back pressed against the wall or the floor. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds to one minute.

, You can also strengthen and stretch your forearms by doing side plank on your elbow. Strong forearms will protect your tendons and prevent the development of tennis elbow.To do side planks, lay down on one side on an exercise mat. Place your forearm under your shoulder, with your elbow and forearm flat on the mat. Then, straighten your legs and raise them off the mat. Lift from your hip area so you are using your abdominal muscles and your arm muscles. You can make a fist with the hand on the mat to prevent falling into your shoulder joint.
Hold the side plank for 30 seconds to one minute. Then, repeat on the other side with the other forearm.

Add produce to pancakes.,
Mix produce into meatballs.,
Make omelets or scrambles.,
Try out various salads.,
Cut out meat once a week.,
Double the amount of veggies specified in a recipe.,
Replace carbs with veggies.",How to Add More Produce to Your Diet1," You can mix a variety of fruits straight into the batter, such as blueberries, strawberries, or even peaches. It is a common misconception that pancakes must be sweet. You could also stir in finely chopped vegetables and crumbled meat to make a more savory pancake., Grate vegetables or puree them using a food processor. Then, add this mixture into your meatball base. Once you cook the meatballs fully, you will barely be able to notice the changes. In fact, it may lead to a moister final product.Carrots, squash, apples, and even potatoes are all good options to add into meat mixtures. This step would also work for a meatloaf or meat patties.

, Vegetables and savory botanical fruits such as tomatoes and peppers both go well with eggs. Chop up a variety and then toss them into some scrambled eggs. Experiment with different combinations until you find a few recipes that you prefer. This makes a healthy, filling, and creative breakfast or snack.The standard southwest omelet with eggs, cheese, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions is always a good option.

, Salads get a bad rap for being boring, but that doesn’t have to be the case. You can experiment with various types of greens, such as kale. You can top the salad with fresh vegetables or fruits, such as strawberries or even cucumbers. For an extra flourish, try out different nuts as toppings., Going meatless for one particular day each week could cut down on your expenses, while also giving you a great chance to boost your produce consumption. Use this as an opportunity to get creative with a main dish. Look for vegetarian recipes online for guidance.Veggie pizzas and egg dishes are great meat-free options.

, Read through the recipe, looking at the vegetable amounts suggested. Take this suggestion and increase it by at least twice as much. It may change the texture and flavor of the dish, but the health benefits will be worth it. Try this with your favorite recipes, such as marinara or chili, in order to make it more appetizing.Soup recipes are a great way to increase your veggie intake. In a white bean soup, for example, you could add double the kale and other chopped vegetables, such as zucchini or peppers., Whenever a recipe calls for a carb, put a veggie in its place. Make veggie pasta by cutting down large strips of zucchini or squash. You can also use spaghetti squash as a long pasta substitute. Mash cauliflower to make a mashed potato substitute. You can even form mashed veggies into cakes and grill them with a bit of olive oil.Use lettuce or cabbage leaves as a substitute for bread, filling them with something like chicken salad."

Decide if your rabbit should stay outdoors at all.,
Feed your rabbit more than carrots.,
Keep its home clean.,
Don’t leave your rabbit lonely.,
Give your rabbit daily exercise and play time.",How to Care for an Outdoor Rabbit1," Traditionally, pet rabbits have often been kept outside in a pen or “hutch.” And, since you see wild bunnies hopping around all the time, you may assume that your pet will do fine outside as well. But there are many factors to consider.


Some organizations now strongly urge that you keep house rabbits indoors at all times. Domesticated rabbits have lost the instincts and skills that keep their wild companions alive, and are not creatures that are suited to isolation, extreme conditions, or surprises (from predators or otherwise).Others contend that it is acceptable to keep rabbits outside during the daytime, when the risk of predators is lower. Domesticated rabbits can die of shock from the mere sight of a predator, so even a secure enclosure may not keep your bunny safe from a raccoon, fox, or neighborhood cat.Still others still say that, with proper preparation and care, full-time outdoor living is fine. As your rabbit’s caretaker, the decision is yours.;
, Bugs Bunny may have done fine with a single-veggie diet, but real rabbits require lots of hay and diet diversity.


The staple of your rabbit’s diet should be hay, which should be available at your pet supply store. This should make up about 75% of its diet.Each day, add in some leafy greens and a handful of rabbit pellets, which offer important nutrients. Add various vegetables (yes, including carrots) and some fruits to the mix., A rabbit will typically establish one or two litter areas in its enclosure (let the rabbit decide where, and then place a bunny litter box there), but keeping the area clean in general is important for health and happiness.


Do some general clean-up daily, removing soiled straw, etc. Perform a more thorough cleaning at least every one-to-two months, removing and replacing bedding materials and the like.Soiled and/or damp bedding will encourage flies, which can bring on maggots that can infest your rabbit and cause “fly strike,” a potentially fatal illness., Wild rabbits are sociable creatures, and that quality has not been bred out of their domesticated cousins. So, if you’re going to have a pet rabbit, spend time with it, and consider giving it a friend or two.


Check on your rabbit at least once or twice a day, and spend some time with it. Hold it, or let it roam free a bit (in your bathroom, for instance, or an outdoor “rabbit run” enclosure).
Many rabbits prefer a companion, so think about adding another compatible bunny — ideally one of similar size and age. Make sure they are spayed or neutered, especially if you have boy and girl bunnies together — you know what they say about rabbits!, Rabbits are meant to be active creatures, running and hopping about, and need at least three hours of ""free range"" time per day for exercise.""Free range,"" however, does not mean loose and unsupervised in the yard, unless you want your bunny pal to become lunch for your neighbor's cat. Your rabbit must either be supervised or placed in a secure ""bunny run"" that allows plenty of room for horizontal and vertical movement.
Rabbits are also curious, sociable, and intelligent, and thus benefit from play time (and so will you!). Games like ""bunny bowling"" (the rabbit knocking over plastic pins), ""fetch"" (with you doing the fetching!), and ""cardboard castle"" (which is inevitably destroyed) are among the many play options.Rabbits enjoy playing with paper, cardboard, hard plastic, or untreated wood toys as well. Avoid treated wood and some varieties such as cherry, redwood, and peach, as these may be toxic."

Ask about antiviral treatments.,
Give your cat antibiotics.,
Discuss if anti-fungals are appropriate.,
Treat allergies.,
Understand surgery may be necessary.",How to Treat a Cat for Eye Inflammation3," Often, the underlying cause will be a viral infection. If that's the case, the cat will need to be given antivirals to treat that condition. However, not all viral infections can be treated directly through medication.Typical viral infections include herpes and calici. Herpes is usually treated with L-lysine (an amino acid supplement), famcyclovir (an antiviral), trifluridine (antiviral eye drops), and/or betadine (antiviral eye drops). These medications will not completely eradicate the disease, but they will help lessen its effects and the possibility of recurrence.
With the calici virus, treatment will be focused on the symptoms, including pain medications and antibiotics to prevent other infections.

, Your vet will often recommend antibiotics, particularly if the inflammation is caused by an injury or an underlying bacterial infection (cold). Antibiotics are also given to help ward off other infections.Mycoplasma, bordatella, and chlamydia can all be treated with antibiotics.

, At times, anti-fungals may be necessary to treat the underlying problem. For instance, if the cat has a fungal infection on its eyelids, the vet may prescribe an anti-fungal cream to help treat the issue., Allergies can be a cause of eye inflammation, and therefore, treating the allergies can help. Your vet may recommend an antihistamine to diminish the cat's reactions to allergens. Steroids can also be useful on occasion.Ask the vet about an omega-3 fatty acid supplement, which may help your cat's allergies.
You can also take steps to minimize allergens by limiting your cat's exposure to the outdoors, as well as changing up the cat's food to find one your cat doesn't react to.

, In some cases of inflammation, such as uveitis, your cat may need surgery. Generally, your cat will need surgery if it has a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer, in which case the eye may need to be removed.Another condition where your cat will need surgery is if the lens moves out of place. The vet will need to put it back."

,, The game then starts over again with the remaining players, and so it continues until there is but one person remaining. If great care is taken, the numbers can be counted up to 70, which, according to the rules, would, of course, be called Buzz. The numbers would then be carried on as Buzz 1, Buzz 2, etc., up to 79, but it is very seldom that this stage is reached.

Consider having double panel curtains.,
Buy shower rings.",How to Buy a Shower Curtain," Measure your shower to determine the size of liner and shower curtain you will need. You will want your liner to fit in your shower for appearance and so it does its job of preventing water from escaping into your bathroom. Most liners for a standard size shower are 70 inches by 72 inches.


There are extra long liners that are 70 inches by 84 inches or 72 inches by 84 inches.
You can purchase an extra wide liner that is 144 inches by 72 inches.
If you have a stall shower, instead of a traditional bathtub size shower, there are shower stall liners that are 54 inches by 78 inches.;
, Most liners are vinyl, but you can also purchase liners in fabric (such as nylon or polyester). Some people think that vinyl liners look cheaper than fabric ones, but vinyl liners stick to the sides of the tub to help prevent water from spilling on the floor. Vinyl liners are also easier to clean because you can just wipe them down with a sponge or cloth.


Fabric liners tend to be machine wash only and blow away from the tub, which can cause water to spill. However, fabric liners are more durable and last longer than vinyl liners. , You can purchase liners that have magnets that weigh down the liner to help it stay in place. You can also purchase liners that have suction cups on the bottom to help it stick to your tub and not blow away., If your liner has grommets along the top, it is less likely to rip. Grommets reinforce the top of liner where the holes for the rings are. If your liner might face a lot of wear and tear (particularly in children’s bathrooms), you might want to opt for grommets., You can get a liner that is resistant to bacteria and mildew. The packaging on the liner will specify if it prevents bacteria and mildew. This is especially important if you live in a humid environment or don’t have good ventilation in your bathroom., You can get liners in many colors, not just clear or white, to match your shower curtain. You can also use a liner alone, and have no shower curtain to keep things simple.For simplicity, choose a white or clear liner.
You could also choose a solid color liner that coordinates with the pattern on your shower curtain.

, You should measure the size of your shower to see what curtain you should buy. When it comes to choosing a curtain size you have options depending on how you want the curtain to look. You can get a floor length curtain or have your curtain just touch the top of the bathtub. A standard shower curtain is 72 inches by 72 inches.


You can purchase stall curtains that are 54 inches by 78 inches.
Extra long curtains are 72 inches by 84 inches or 96 inches.
Extra wide curtains are 108 inches by 72 inches., You can get a fabric shower curtain in polyester, cotton, or a blend. They are usually machine washable but some are dry-clean only.Cotton shower curtains are easy to maintain, but need to be used with a liner. Vinyl shower curtains repel moisture and do not necessarily need a liner with them.


You can opt for fabric curtains in microfiber because they are soft and water resistant., You can get a curtain in many colors and patterns, from color blocking to holographic designs. Think about the overall appearance of your bathroom and try to coordinate your shower curtain. You can make your shower curtain the focus of your bathroom or just a subtle detail.For example, if your bathroom has a tropical theme, you might want to get a shower curtain that has an image of palm trees and the ocean.

, Instead of having one curtain for your shower, you can have two. Put one shower curtain on each side of the shower to frame your shower like a window.


You can cut a shower curtain in half then hem the edges and put them on each side of one rod if you want the curtains to open down the middle.
If you are using a liner, cut and hem the liner as well., Make sure to buy shower rings for your curtain and liner. You can get basic rings or more decorative ones. Have your shower rings match the decor of your bathroom and curtain.


You can buy a hookless shower curtain that does not need rings for a ceiling-track curtain rod."

Pick your flowers.,
Prepare the flowers in bunches.,
Tie the end of each bunch with a rubber band.,
Hang the bunches upside-down.,
Wait for 2–4 weeks.,
Preserve them with hairspray (optional).",How to Dry Flowers1," Most flowers air-dry best when they are just beginning to open. They will continue to open slightly as they dry, and a fully open flower may lose its petals.This method works best for small, sturdy blossoms, such as lavender or larkspur.Wilting and pest damage becomes more obvious after drying. Choose only the best flowers, and pick extra in case of problems.;
, Strip each flower stem of all leaves. Separate the flowers by species, then make bunches with up to 10 flowers of a single type. Large flowers such as hydrangeas, roses, and peonies should be dried individually instead.








Strawflower and some other species have weak stems that break apart when dried. Cut the stem off instead and thread florist's wire through the base of the flower., Wrap a large rubber band around two or three stems, wrap it several times around the whole bunch, then finish by wrapping it around another two or three stems.The stems will shrink as they dry, but the rubber band will stay tight around them.









The rubber band shouldn't press so hard that it creases the stem; this can cause damp pockets and lead to rot. If you're concerned about this, tie the bunch with twine or raffia instead. You may need to re-tie the twine halfway through drying.

, Keep them in a warm, dark, dry location to prevent rot and minimize fading.Air circulation helps the flowers dry and prevents mold, so keep the bunches spaced out in an area with a good cross-breeze, at least 6 inches (15cm) below the ceiling.








You can hang the flowers from hooks, nails, or coat hangers. One easy way to do it is a paper clip bent into an S-shape. Poke one end underneath the rubber band, and the other end over the hook., The flower is ready when the petals are crisp to the touch. Occasionally a bunch will take longer than four weeks, usually because the room isn't ideal or the flower petals are unusually thick.


The stems usually dry completely straight. If you want a more natural, curved look, submerge the stems in warm water until soft. Bend them however you like, and hold them in position with weights until they dry again., A light mist of aerosol hairspray or floral sealer will set the flowers' shape. This will make them less susceptible to breaking or dropping petals.

Do not immerse pearl cutlery into the water completely.,
Rinse with care.,
If you need to clean the handles of the pearl cutlery, see Clean Mother of Pearl (Nacre).

",How to Care for Cutlery With Pearl Handles2," A plant-based detergent or one based on castile soap are ideal.

, Instead, wash the cutlery's metallic end and try to avoid placing the handle join into the water. The reason for this is that many pearl cutlery joins use water-based glue and the glue will weaken in the water, causing it to split and crack.

, Dry immediately using a soft cloth. Towelling tea towels are the best.

Disconnect the jumper cables in the following order once you get the dead-battery car running:


Negative ground (engine-block bolt or, less desirably, negative terminal on the dead battery).",How to Hook up Jumper Cables," Position the vehicles so that the batteries are as close together as possible, but make sure the two cars do not touch.;
,, Set the parking brakes, and switch each car into park or neutral (for automatic or manual transmissions, respectively).

, The cables leading to the positive battery terminal are almost always red. If you're in doubt, the battery itself has a ""+"" and ""-"" sign to mark the positive and negative terminals.


Check the terminals on the battery for corrosion before jump starting. If you notice any corrosion on the terminals, clean them and then try to start the car once more before proceeding with the jump. The battery may not be dead it just may have a bad connection.

,


Leads on jumper cables are normally not the exact same length to prevent them from touching. If they are the same length, make sure they have not been modified in any way or damaged.

, Make sure the clamp is securely attached to the battery terminal.


On some vehicles, you may have to remove a plastic cover from the positive battery terminal before you can make this connection.

, Again, make sure the clamp is securely connected and won't slip off due to vibration in the engine compartment.

,, Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface inside the engine compartment on the vehicle with the dead battery — the farther from the battery, the better.


An unpainted bolt on the engine block is ideal. Remember, the clamp must be able to ""bite"" securely onto the object in question and hold in place, even if the engine vibrates.
You can, theoretically, connect the second black clamp to the negative terminal on the dead battery instead. But this produces a spark, which could ignite hydrogen fumes from the battery.
Check to make sure no part of the jumper cables — or tools, or battery covers — dangle into the engine compartment, where it might foul belts, pulleys, or other moving parts.

, Run the RPM up to about 3,000 as you attempt to start the car with the dead battery.

Obtain the proper custody form.,
Obtain other forms, as necessary.,
Complete your forms.,
Prepare your forms for filing.,
File your forms.,
Serve your children’s other parent.",How to File for Custody in Maryland2," The Maryland Courts provide free forms for divorce, an establishment of custody, and modification of custody. You may download the forms by visiting the Court’s Family Law Forms section at http://www.courts.state.md.us/family/formsindex.html#domesticrelations. The Court provides four different forms, or sets of forms, that can be used for child custody cases or cases which involve child custody. Those are:


A complaint for custody may be used by either parent, or a third party, in order to request a custody order where one has not yet been issued in a divorce or establishment of paternity.A parent or third party who wishes to modify the current custody order should use the Petition to Modify Custody form.
A parent who has minor children and wishes to divorce the child(ren)’s other parent, may ask for custody in their Complaint for Absolute Divorce
A limited divorce, or legal separation, may be sought by parties who are unsure if they want to divorce.It allows the parties to begin living separately and dividing property, while remaining married, in case their differences cannot be resolved. The Court may decide issues such as custody and child support during a limited divorce or the parties can agree on such issues and file their written agreement with the Court.

, Besides the Petition for custody or divorce, a party filing a lawsuit for custody may also need to file other forms, such as a/an:


Financial Statement. Divorcing parties will likely need to fill out the long form Financial Statement]If you are unsure if you need to file a form, you can ask the Clerk.
Domestic Case Information Report. This should be filed with each petition for divorce or to establish or modify custody.Child Support Guideline Worksheets. If you are asking for sole physical custody, you may need to complete Child Support Guideline Worksheet A, and if you are asking for shared physical custody, Child Support Guideline Worksheet B.Certificate or Affidavit of Service. This simply states that you served your spouse with the require documents.
Request for Hearing or Proceeding. If you are filing your custody action alone and the child’s other parent does not agree with you on all issues, you may need to schedule a hearing by filing a Request for Hearing or Proceeding.

, When completing your forms, type or print neatly in blue or black ink. You can find instruction for most custody and family law forms on the, under ‘Instructions’. If you need help, the Clerk of Courts in the County where you will file your suit may be able to provide you with a limited amount of assistance. However, some questions may be considered asking for legal advice, and the Clerk will not be able to answer those questions. If you need assistance that the Clerk of Courts cannot provide, check your county Court’s website for free and low-cost legal aid. You can locate your Court’s website at http://www.courts.state.md.us/family/localcontacts.html

, Once complete, you will need to prepare your forms for filing with the Court. To do this:


Print and sign all appropriate forms. Some forms, like the Certificate or Affidavit of Service, cannot be signed or mailed until after you have filed for custody and served your child’s other parent a copy of the Complaint or Petition. If you are unsure when to file a specific form, read the instructions, and/or ask the Clerk when the Court will need it.
Call the Clerk of Courts in the county where you will file, and ask how many copies of each form they need, what your filing fee will be, and what forms of payment are accepted.
Make the appropriate number of copies. If you do not have a copy machine, check with your local library and/or post office for copy services. Most libraries will make copies for between $.10 and $.25 a page.
Staple together any forms that are more than one page long. Be sure not to staple two different forms together. Each form should have a case caption at the top of the first page. The case caption is the part that lists the state, county, and court, the parties, and states the case or cause number.

, Take your prepared forms and filing fee to the County Clerk’s Office for filing with the Court. The fee will be at least $300; if you cannot afford that, then ask the judge for a waiver. The Clerk will assist you with stamping your forms and filing them. Be sure that you get a stamped copy of each form that you file, so you have a record of what was filed and when.

, After filing you forms with the Court, you will need to make sure that your child’s other parent, or his or her attorney, gets a copy of each form that you filed. You can do this by mailing the copies via Certified Mail or by hiring the county Sheriff or a process server to serve the copies personally. If you are having trouble locating the other parent, then check out the information at Serve-Court-Papers for more details.

Understand comorbidity.",How to Cope With Anxiety and Depression," Not only does regular exercise reduce the likelihood of heart disease and other illnesses, it has also been shown to treat both depression and anxiety. There are various explanations for why this occurs. First, exercise releases endorphins, a feel-good chemical in the brain that improves mood. It also reduces certain immune system chemicals that cause depression and raises the body temperature, which promotes relaxation.Regular exercise also helps you get in shape and improve your overall appearance, which for many people, is enough to rid them of their self-doubt.
Endorphins help to inhibit your body’s stress response, which lowers your risk for feeling anxious or developing symptoms of panic throughout the day.
Some studies show that exercise helps to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety just as well as medication. Even just 10 minutes of physical exercise can help alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms as much as a 45-minute workout.Exercise can lower your baseline anxiety or the level of tension or anxiety you experience daily. If you experience a high level of anxiety symptoms daily, exercise can decrease the number or severity of these symptoms that you experience.;
, People who suffer from anxiety tend to turn to alcohol to ease their tension and nervousness. Though alcohol may ease symptoms temporarily, it will actually make them worse in the long run.According to the Dietary Guidelines of America, if you are female, you should have no more than one drink per day. If you are a male, you should no more than two per day.Because alcohol is a depressant, is temporarily suppresses your feelings of anxiety or tension, however, when the alcohol is metabolized and rids the body, your anxiety and depression will rebound.Similar to a spring that has to be pressed down harder and harder, your emotions are held down even more by the alcohol. Once the alcohol is gone, the spring will jump even high than it is when it’s just sitting there. This rebound means that you will likely experience more anxiety the next day, or be more susceptible to stress., The high levels of caffeine that are present in coffee can worsen anxiety symptoms in both the short and long run. Caffeine is a stimulant which makes your body and nervous system wired and alert, which increases your risk of worsening or developing depression and anxiety throughout the day.By limiting your caffeine intake, you can help control over your body’s physical response and prevent experiencing anxiety symptoms throughout the day. Consider switching to decaf, or drinking tea instead. Some tea, such as green tea, still contains some caffeine, but won't have the same extreme effects of coffee.

, Nicotine, much like caffeine, is a stimulant and can produce many of the same effects on the body associated with other stimulants, such as feeling wired. Nicotine is in tobacco products and is also in non-tobacco products such as nicotine gum.


Realize that quitting smoking is a difficult task and should only be taken on during non-stressful times. However, doing so could greatly reduce your symptoms of anxiety and depression., Depression is a painful experience which affects your mood, but also energy and motivation. If you are depressed, it may be difficult to focus or you may be tempted to stay in bed all day. You may be anxious if you don't know how your day will go. Try to continue your regular routines as much as possible, and avoid letting your moods dictate what you do and what you get done.


If you normally don't have much structure, it may benefit you to begin to structure your days. Plan out your days, making sure they are full but not overwhelming and stick to the schedule so you can continue to function in your daily life., If you are suffering from anxiety, it may be because you are worried, uncertain, or nervous about the future. If you are suffering from depression, it may be because you are constantly dwelling on the past, ruminating about things gone wrong, or thinking self-defeating thoughts. Learning to appreciate the present moment will have a remarkable impact on your life. However, this is no easy feat, but it will help you to separate your feelings from your thoughts.


The best way to stop dwelling on the past or obsessing over the future is to notice when these kinds of thoughts arise throughout your daily life. When they do, then acknowledge them, label them thoughts, and let them fade away.
Try to focus on what is happening around you and what your activities entail. Take stock of the people around you and how you feel performing whatever activity you are taking part in. It will help you come out of the past and focus on the present. Keep trying and you'll get to a state of mindfulness.

, Regular meditation practice has been shown to ease symptoms of stress and anxiety.Mindfulness can also help you feel more connected to other, it can help you gain more control over your emotions, and increase your ability to think about situations in a new light. Consider joining a meditation center or group in your area. Most centers offer free meditation instruction and have weekly open houses.


To practice mindfulness and meditate, take a few moments every day to close your eyes, relax your muscles, and focus all of your attention on your breath. If a thought arises, then acknowledge it and let it disappear. The more you do this, the more you will eventually be able to incorporate it into your daily life. , Your inner critic is self-defeating or exaggerated thoughts that keep your feelings of depression and anxiety at large. Your inner critic may say things like “I’m a failure” or “There is nothing I can do, and I’m stuck.” Your inner critic may also latch onto one of your worries or thoughts that cause anxiety and then cause a snowball effect of more and more worrisome thoughts. Thoughts such as these keep you from being able to see choices in your life, make you feel incapable or stuck, or perpetuate worries, depression, or anxiety.


Learn to quiet your inner critic to lessen the effect is has on your perspective and your mood. To quiet your inner critic, practice catching your unproductive thoughts as they come up, and be prepared with a productive counter-thought or mantra that focus on your strengths.If you think “There is nothing I can do, I am stuck” Test if that is true. Make a list of all your possible options. Change your inner critic to say “Although my options are not the best, I do have a choice, and I choose_________ because….”
If you have a thought that pops into year head that triggers a worry, fear, or other anxiety symptoms, be sure to counter you inner critic with a reassuring statement or phrase such as “I know the likelihood of that happening is very low, so I have nothing to worry about” or “Everything is going to be ok, I am fine in this moment and this feeling will pass.”

, Many people are depressed or anxious because they are holding on to one or more traumatic experiences from the past, and they are going through a significant change, or have lost a loved one. While it is extremely difficult to erase these memories and go through these experiences, there are things you can do to reduce their prevalence in your everyday life.


Grieve when you need to. If you feel the need to cry or scream, then do it. Catharsis is a necessary part of the healing process. You can even look for grief groups in your area for support through your time of grief. If you are grieving, remember that it is a normal process with many emotions involved. You may not feel like yourself some time. However, if you continue to feel symptoms of grief long after losing your loved one, you should contact a therapist or mental health professional.
Write out what happened and how it made you feel. There are many feelings involved with traumatic events that often need to be expressed. Many times, traumatic events will get compartmentalized and any feelings associated with the event will get pushed aside. Instead of doing this, which can lead to anxiety and depression, write down exactly what happened in as vivid detail as possible. Write down what you felt and what you still feel about the event. This will help you cope and move on.

, When you are having issues with depression and anxiety or you are trying to get over a past trauma, describe what happened and how it made you feel. You can do this by journaling or speaking with someone you trust. Getting it out is better than repressing it. Also, think about the contextual aspects of the traumatic event. Remembering other aspects of the day the event happened, such as the weather or who else was there, can help you dissolve some of the negative associations.If you are dealing with memories of a traumatic past, it is essential that you seek professional help to deal with the painful emotions caused by trauma.

, Anxiety can be a gripping experience and can make your feel as though you are losing control. There are some techniques you can try to get your body and mind to slow and calm. Depression symptoms have a wide range and differ depending on the type of depression you have. For some, they feel overwhelmingly sad while others feel nothing at all and just feel numb. Still, others can have sudden bouts of irritability.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a method that helps to physically reduce the tension in your muscles, which signals the brain to begin calming down. In a serial fashion, contract, hold and then release muscle groups of the body. Work from head to toe, and be sure to focus on the sensations you feel when you release the contraction and feel your muscle tension reducing.


Beginning with your facial muscles, tighten the muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Repeat this down your body with your neck, chest, arms, hands, legs, calves, and feet., Controlled breathing, or diaphragm breathing, is another way to signal your body to begin relaxing and start to calm its stress response, which is often anxiety. Controlled breathing signals your brain to release neurotransmitters, which tells your body that it is no longer in danger and can calm down. Practice diaphragm breathing by taking a full breath making your abdomen expand, hold it, then release.


The timing for this should be five seconds breathing in, hold for five seconds, and then breathe out for five seconds. Take two normal breaths, then repeat the timed, abdominal breathing until you feel your anxiety subside., Distraction is a short term technique that you can use when you are in a situation that may not be appropriate for depression or anxiety, such as at work. Some distraction examples include engaging in activities. If you are at work, talk to a co-worker about funny cat videos or organize the supply cabinet. If you are with your children or grandchildren at home and cannot deal with your emotion at that moment, take them for a walk or read a book together.


You can also distract yourself with small activities. Try doing simple math in your head, grabbing a piece of paper and folding it into multiple different shapes, splashing water on your face, or playing a word game. You can also do word or number puzzles like crosswords or Sudoku.
For a quick distraction when you feel your emotions may overtake you, distract yourself with sensations, such as squeezing a rubber ball or holding onto an ice cube., Do some research and meet with several different doctors before choosing one to stick with. During your first session, your doctor will ask you describe your symptoms, how long they have been present, and about your past. You might want to reflect on some of these questions before your first appointment so that you can organize your thoughts and clarify any information, if necessary.

, You may decide to see a psychiatrist, a doctor with a medical degree who is licensed to prescribe medication. Psychiatrists usually combine talk therapy and medical treatment, but not always.Several types of antidepressants are prescribed to treat anxiety as well. These medications types include SSRIs, SNRIs, and tricyclic antidepressants.


There are several different types of medication within these categories, so it is best to speak with your physician or psychiatrist about which would be best for you. , You may also choose to see a psychologist, a doctor without a medical degree who focuses on talk and cognitive behavioral therapy. In most states of the U.S., psychologists are not licensed to prescribe medications.However, there are a few states in which psychologists can prescribe medication, including New Mexico, Louisiana, and Illinois.If you are under the age of eighteen, talk to your parents about your condition, if they aren't already aware of it, and ask them for help finding the right doctor.
Some patients are open to the prospect of medications while other prefer to take the natural route. You should clarify your preferred method of treatment with your therapist upon meeting him or her so that you can determine whether or not it is a right fit. Remember that each doctor has his or her own preferred method of treatment.

, If you don't have access to a psychologist or psychiatrist, there are other professionals of mental help that can help you with your depression and anxiety. Look for psychiatric nurses, licensed clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and licensed professional counselors in your area. These individuals have training and education in mental health and can help you with your issues., In the realm of psychological illnesses, it is easy to misdiagnose or miss a secondary diagnosis. See more than one doctor for your condition, at least initially, especially if you have been written a prescription.


Don't let your doctor force you into taking medications. If you prefer to go the all natural route, then be vocal and let your doctor know. If he or she continues to insist on prescribing you a medication, you might want to consider seeing another doctor.
If multiple doctors insist on prescribing you the same type of medication, you should consider giving it a try. Most medications can be discontinued after a year without any harmful side-effects. , You can't pay a mental health professional to fix your problems. You will have to actively engage in your therapy sessions, and be honest and open with your doctor. Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a form of talk therapy, has been shown to be the most effective method of treatment for anxiety and depression but requires more commitment and cooperation from you than interpersonal therapy. Instead of just talking out your problems, cognitive behavioral therapy requires your active participation in order for it to work and for you to get better.Be open to trying new things and pushing past your comfort zone. Some doctors assign their patients with ""exercises"" to apply to their everyday life.

, Sometimes depression and anxiety are situational, such as a result of a big change. Other times, it is simply biological and the use of medication can help. If you have been prescribed a medication for your condition, then give it time to work before discontinuing use. It can also take some experimentation on your and your doctor's part in order to find the right medication and dosage for your particular situation. Just be patient and give it time.


Most medications take four to eight weeks to show any effects, so be patient., Comorbidity is the presence of more than one condition in an individual.Comorbidity for depression and anxiety is common, and most psychiatrist will assume you have both until proven otherwise. This is mostly because, for patients, the presentation or subjective experience of symptoms of depression and anxiety are often indistinguishable, meaning that the patient can't tell whether one originated separately from the other.


Because many of the symptoms of depression and anxiety overlap, it is often hard to tease out which symptoms are attributed to which condition. In fact, about 85% of people with depression experience symptoms of anxiety, and about 90% of people with anxiety experience depression.
Comorbidity of any conditions often complicates treatment and makes outcomes less positive, and this is true of anxiety and depression comorbidity as well. A key factor in improving treatment outcomes for comorbid depression and anxiety is the recognition of the comorbidity.Depending on which depression and anxiety diagnoses you have, there could be many overlapping symptoms. For example, depressive ruminations common in Major Depressive Disorder are similar to obsessive worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder, while poor sleep or sleeplessness and poor concentration are common in both Major Depressive Disorder and Post-traumatic stress disorder."

It is descriptive of the kind of content your blog provides and should be easy to remember. Keep the name short and try to choose a keyword. For example, if your business is about sewing, www.planetsew.com or www.diamondsew.com is an informative link.Keep in mind that you’ll want this domain to be permanent. When you start over with a new domain, you have to start over with no ranking in search engines.
Use a search website such as Lean Domain Search to find available domain names.;
, Your business blog needs a place to store the all of your uploads, including images and blog posts. Some services and blog hosts, such as Wordpress, offer limited space for free. As your blog grows, you’ll need more storage space. Bluehost is one such site that offers hosting services for cheap and may help you easily link your account to your actual blog., Now you’ll need somewhere to display your blog posts. Sites such as Wordpress, Blogger, and Tumblr have different features and costs. Wordpress for example is highly popular, offers the most customization options, and is free to set up, making it good for small blogs., A good blog must look appealing to readers. If you or someone you know has graphical and coding expertise, you can make the design yourself. Otherwise, consider buying a custom design from a site like Creative Market or using a premade one from the blogging platform. Customize it to your liking.The design should be easy on the eyes and allow for all images and text to be easy to read.

, The bigger your business, the more you’ll want to have a logo. It should be prominently displayed at the top of your page. This logo needs to be easily recognizable so that viewers know who you are and can identify your brand. Sketch out designs on paper before you settle on one. You can even ask your blog readers for their opinions.For example, a cake designer may want the logo to look colorful with a cake or frosting incorporated into it. Italic, black letters on a white background may appear sophisticated and artistic.
Many designers make a logo out of their initials.

, The about page will tell your readers about you. What is your business about? Why did you start this business? What experience do you have in your industry? What do you offer? It is a good idea to add a personal photo and contact information to give your business blog a personal touch. This information may also be incorporated on the front page under the blog’s title..The personal photo can be used in the blog’s header in place of a logo.

, Once the blog is set up, it’s time to initiate it. The first post you make can be a test run, simply introducing yourself and your brand, but keep in mind what you want this blog to be. Start thinking of what you want and need to talk about in your posts to make your business successful and keep your readers coming back.Remember to always check your posts for grammatical and spelling mistakes.
Content for your blog might include stories that illustrate your passion for your chosen field, news about your business, and images of your products.

, Once you’ve initiated your blog, keep updating it with new posts. Talk about personal stories you have, such as learning your craft, your experiences opening a business, or how you developed your passion for that craft. Show pictures of your products and talk about how you made them. Talk about your values or trends in your industry. Write about business updates, promotions, news of new products, and giveaways.

It’s up to you how you update the blog, but remember that the end goal is to promote your business.

, In order to keep your blog fresh and at the top of search engines, you need to write content consistently. It’s a good idea to keep your blog updated at least once a week. Always try to introduce topics you wish to discuss and don’t forget to promote your brand by sharing yourself and your products.Making a content schedule may help keep you on track.
Consistency is key to building readership, so don’t delay writing until you’re sure you’ve got the perfect topic.

, Email lists are the easiest way to gain repeat visitors. Look at your blog service for ways to do this. On Wordpress, you can install a plugin or sign up for a service such as MailChimp. Your blog should have a box that your readers use to input their email address. Once the addresses are collected, you can easily send out updates to your readers.It is recommended that you send your emails using a service or official email address. Mail sent through your blog may end up in the spam folder of your readers’ inboxes.

, While email lists serve as open reminders to current readers, advertisements attract new readers. Set up an account on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter. Pinterest is important since it is a site about sharing creative products.Social media provides an opportunity to connect with people who will be interested in your business.
Remember to publish news of your blog posts along with a link when you update your blog.

, Your readers will leave comments on your blogs. Take the time to respond to them in a positive way. By doing this, you can answer questions and provide more of a personal connection with your readers. They may even give you useful feedback or new ideas for your blog.

This gives you an opportunity to build a customer base and develop relationships with people who can help your business, including other bloggers.

Allow your child to make some decisions.",How to Punish a Child for Being Naughty," Make sure your child knows exactly what is expected of him/her, and what will happen they break the rules. You can teach your child about the consequences of their actions by explaining the connection between choices and consequences. For example, you can connect your child’s behavior to consequences by saying things such as:


“You are choosing to end your time at the park early by misbehaving.”“You lost your turn to play with the toy when you stole it from another child.”
“You made the decision to end the play date when you bit your friend.”
“By not picking up your toys you chose to lose the privilege of playing with them.”
“By not being honest, you lost the privilege of our trust.”;
, Actions have natural consequences, and places like school, church, and society all have their own expectations of your child. Sometimes your child will have to learn the hard way that it isn’t just your household that will impose rules on their behavior. Difficult as it may be, it’s important to let your child fail sometimes so that he can learn about consequences.


For example, instead of you staying up late to help the night before an assignment is due, let your child get a bad grade they didn’t do their homework. This lesson is especially important for older children to learn since they will start to expect more independence and trust from you.With young children, this lesson may take on a less severe form. For example, if your child breaks a toy on purpose, do not replace it. This will help him learn what it means to be responsible and how it feels to lose something.
Children of all ages must also learn to be respectful of others, so don’t intervene if your child didn’t get invited to a party or event because they were mean to other children., A timeout is an excellent way to allow children and parents time to calm down after an emotional situation. Select an area that is quiet and free of distractions, but not necessarily out of your sight. Ask your child to use the time to think about some solutions to the problem that resulted in the timeout.


Don’t use timeout to humiliate or punish.
For young children, especially those under three, use a timeout mat so that you can still keep an eye on him or her. The mat is also portable, and can be used for timeouts when you aren’t home.Timeout should last no longer than one minute for each year of your child’s age., Do this right after the offense, so that your child understands and connects the bad behavior with the punishment. Use this opportunity to teach your child about natural and logical consequences by matching the revoked toy or privilege with the offending behavior.


Physical items like toys will work better with younger children, while an older child may respond better to the loss of a privilege or freedom he had been granted.
Don’t give in and end the punishment early, or next time your child will know that they can control the situation.Privileges that can be taken away include watching television, playing on the computer or video games, playing with friends, trips to the park, parties or use of the family vehicle for older children.

, Corporal punishment is illegal in many countries and regions, it can negatively affect the parent-child relationship, and it can damage your child’s normal social development. Most experts agree that while physical discipline has effects on your child’s immediate behavior, it won’t teach him/her right from wrong. Instead of providing your child with the power to control his/her own emotions, corporal punishment will teach him/her that physical violence is an acceptable reaction to anger and adverse situations.Corporal punishment can lead to aggressive behavior.
There is no evidence that physical discipline is an effective means of curbing future misbehavior.
The negative effects of corporal punishment can follow children into adulthood in the form of mental health problems and substance abuse., Young children and babies are curious and it may be hard for them to understand that certain items are off-limits. An alternative option is to remove these items from your child’s view so that they will not be tempted.For example, if you do not want your child to play with your phone or another electronic item, then put it up somewhere that they cannot see or reach it.

, It’s ok to step away from a situation and give yourself time to cool off. Deferring punishment gives you time to contemplate reasonable disciplinary action, and time for your child to think about what they have done. Be clear that you need time to calm down, and that you will discuss the matter when you’re ready.


Resist the urge to be sarcastic, threaten, or criticize. This will just upset your child more, and could have lasting effects on their self-esteem.Watch for the warning signs of fight or flight mode, such as a racing heart, sweaty palms, and shakiness. This can happen when you are extremely angry, annoyed, or hurt.
Practice different relaxation techniques and find what works for you. Deep breathing, long walks, meditation, and baths are good ways to calm down. Some people even find cleaning, exercising, or reading to be excellent ways to settle down.

, It’s important that you explain why their behavior isn’t acceptable, and that he understands why they are being reprimanded. This will teach him that their actions have consequences.


Be firm, but don’t yell. If you yell to communicate your emotions, your child will learn to do the same.Remain calm and act quickly, but not out of anger.
Speak clearly and make eye contact.
For a younger child or toddler, get down to their level when you speak to him.
Provide an explanation if your child is old enough to understand. Keep it feeling based and focus on how their behavior affects and hurts other people. For a tween or teen, discuss the repercussions of their actions or decisions on a larger scale.

, If your child is acting out, getting angry or frustrated, or being disruptive, walk away from the situation with him. Provide them with a safe space to discuss their emotions and actions, and talk about how he can improve their conduct in the future. Remember that children don’t always know how to properly express themselves, and punishment isn’t always the best way to teach them.Be encouraging and reassure your child that you are there to support him.
Tell your child you love him.
Soothe him by saying you understand.
A young child will respond best to cuddles and physical closeness at this time, which will make him feel safe and loved.
An older child who is starting to push away might not want cuddles now, but reassure him that you are there to support him, and teach him ways he can sooth or calm himself. This includes deep breathing, counting, distracting himself, listening to calming music, and visualization techniques.

, Children will often be disobedient and refuse to listen if they think they can get away with it. Create a mantra that reminds the child that you are in charge. Repeat the slogan when he misbehaves. Stick to decisions that you make, otherwise your child will think he is in control. Remember that you are the parent and not a friend, and your job isn’t to be liked, but to keep your child safe and healthy, and to teach him decency and responsibility.


To establish control, try phrases like “I’m the parent,” or “I’m in charge here.”
Don’t back down, no matter what kind of tantrum he throws. Don’t give in even if they try to manipulate you (like by holding their breath).
An older child may try to challenge you on this. Encourage him to participate in discussions about decisions that affect their life, and explore how different options will impact him. Remember that ultimately, the final decision is yours, but be prepared to explain how you reached it so he can see the responsible decision making process.

, Your child needs to observe good behavior to know what it looks like. No matter how old your child is, they will notice how you respond and behave in all kinds of situations. Make sure that you are modeling the kinds of behavior that you want your child to display.For example, if you want your child to use good manners, then make sure that you model this behavior for your child. This might be as simple as saying “please” and “thank you,” or waiting patiently in line at the grocery store.

, Sometimes children act out because they know they’ll get attention, so recognize, acknowledge, and show appreciation for good behavior instead of just reacting to bad conduct. This promotes self-esteem, encourages more good behavior, and discourages acting out. Focus on your feelings and how their behavior positively affects you both, and he will learn that good behavior is its own reward.


Tell him when you are proud of a good choice he made.
Be specific when you praise him and emphasize the behavior you want to acknowledge.
Depending on their age, thank them for good listening skills, sharing, or for completing chores and tasks.
Compare past behavior with present actions and focus on how he has improved. Set realistic goals for further improvement in the future., Give your child a small prize to thank him for listening, playing nicely, completing chores, and other good behaviors. Granting a privilege can also be used as a reward, but avoid using food, as this can lead to bad eating habits. Don’t bribe your child into behaving by giving rewards beforehand.


Some families use a sticker chart to track positive changes for a younger child. Tell them what is expected of him in order to earn a sticker, and at the end of the day have a family meeting where you discuss their conduct that day and what they did to earn a sticker (or not).
Points systems can also work, where good behavior earns children points that can be redeemed for fun activities or gifts.Points systems can earn an older child privileges like use of the car or time with their friends.

, Children often act out because they feel they have no control. Grant your child the power to make some small decisions and he will feel more in control, and will act out less.Allow him to choose between a book and coloring before dinner or bedtime when he’s young.
Let him pick out their own clothes.
Give them the option of what toys to play with in the bath.
Ask them what kind of sandwich he prefers for lunch.
As they gets older, the decisions can get slightly more important. Let they choose classes if his school allows that, or let they decide what after school sports or activities to participate in.
Let them choose what snack they want at the supermarket.

You could be preppy, hipster, goth, etc. Your personal style is an expression of your character. Be sure it is a style you really like before committing to it. Keep in mind that you should still follow your school’s dress code, especially if your school requires a uniform..


Preppy, hipster, and Goth are a few suggestions for style, but your personal style can be anything that appeals to you, even if it doesn’t have a title. Look to the music you listen to, the movies you watch, and the books you read for style inspiration. You can model your style after a person or character you admire.
A preppy style is a classic and clean style that derives from Ivy League collegiate fashion. Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste are a few brands known for being preppy. Collared shirts, sweaters, and chinos are popular for preppy men. Opaque tights, girly blouses, and thin sweaters are popular for womenHipster style has become very popular in recent years. It is very different from preppy style. It is an often ironic style that values non-mainstream style and interests. Flannel shirts, band t-shirts, Doc Martens, and beanies are associated with hipster style.Goth style began in the 1980s by rebellious youths with a unique and often darker view of the world. Goth style is characterized by black or brightly colored hair, dark makeup, black clothing, and large boots.;
, Choose a hairstyle that fits in with the style you would like to adhere to. For preppy style, consider short, gelled hair for men and long straight hair for women. Hipster guys often have their hair cut short on the sides and wear it long on top. The ladies have a broad range of hairstyles from short pixie cuts to long, beach waves. Goths often like to dye their hair black or brightly colored. These are a few options for hairstyles, but there are many choices. Experiment and choose what makes you feel the best about yourself.You can also tease your hair if you associate with Goth style.
Your hair doesn’t specifically have to be associated with your clothing style. You can also choose unique hair styles like braids, very short hair, or very long hair.
Temporary henna dye is also an option if you want to change the color of your hair, but ask your parents first.

, Clothing is the best and most obvious way to show off your personal style. You may need to buy new clothing if your current wardrobe doesn’t work with the style you desire to have. Look through the clothes you own to determine which items of clothing work for your preppy, hipster, Goth style, or other style of your choice. Then, buy new shoes, pants, shirts, sweaters, skirts, and/or dresses that are appropriate for the current season.You don’t have to buy a new wardrobe at once. Buy a few items of clothing at a time that you can wear for the current season. Don’t buy clothes for winter until winter weather gets near.
Buying new clothes can be costly. Save up your allowance. Offer to do odd jobs for friends, family, and/or neighbors. You can also talk with your parents to see if they would be willing to buy new clothes for you.
It’s not necessary to buy all new and expensive clothing. Buy from thrift shops or during big sales.

, Accessorizing has a few different functions. It can help you achieve the style you desire, even if the clothes don’t fall into that style. Wearing accessories can also draw attention to the parts of yourself that you want people to notice. Earrings, necklaces, belts, bracelets, hairbands, and scarves are some examples of accessories. If you attend a school that requires a uniform, accessories can be a way to make your personal style known.A great accessory can be a conversation starter. For example, wearing a necklace that has something to do with your favorite book can draw attention from another fan of the book.
A few preppy accessories for women would be pastel headbands, pearl earrings, tennis bracelets, and monogrammed purses. For men, argyle socks, ties, and leather and canvas belts work.Hipster style accessories can be very broad. A few examples are scrunchies, bowl hats, bow ties, fanny packs, and rimmed glasses.A few Goth accessories are chokers, studded belts and bracelets, jewelry with pentagrams, and purses or bags with skulls on them., It’s okay and normal to be shy. Sometimes, starting a conversation with a fellow student can seem intimidating. Keep in mind that many people feel the same way. You can start a conversation by simply saying “Hello! How are you doing today?” Remember, it’s not your problem if the other person does not respond nicely.


If it is a classmate, ask about an upcoming project or test.
Talk to another student about an upcoming school event.

, Bullying and meanness is common in middle school, but you do not want to get noticed for being unkind to others. Instead, show compassion and kindness whenever possible. Stand up for the people that get bullied. Help the girl that drops her books in the hallway. Talk to the people that seem shy and don’t have many friends. It is better to be noticed for your positive actions and traits., Humor is infectious, and people are drawn to people with a good sense of humor. There is a difference between having a sense of humor and being funny. Being funny means telling jokes, great stories, and finding what is funny about every situation. Having a sense of humor means not taking everything too seriously and having the ability to let things go. Strive for both.


Think about your sense of humor. What makes you laugh? You might have a silly, dry, or dark sense of humor.
Learn jokes by researching them on the internet and watching comedy shows.
Be careful to not be offensive or disruptive with your jokes. You should say anything that will hurt another person’s feelings or get you in trouble in class.

, Confidence is often difficult to achieve during your middle school years. Don’t worry if you don’t feel confident. Many people in your age group do not. You can, however, work on your confidence by acting like you are. People respond positively to confident people, and it is a way to stand out in the crowd. You can build your confidence by having positive expectations, recognizing your talents, and appearing confident.Don’t expect to fail or for others not to like you. Expect to be successful and liked. You can’t control what happens, but positive expectations make positive outcomes more likely.
Everyone is good at something. Recognize your strengths. You might be kind, loyal, and good at avoiding confrontation. You may also be good at running, computers, and acting.
You can appear confident by dressing the way you like, making eye contact, smiling, and having good posture.

, Helping others and setting a good example will make you stand out not just in middle school, but all throughout your life. You don’t have to be older than others students to be a good role model. You can be a good role model by utilizing your kindness and confidence and helping others whenever possible.Never treat anyone as any less than equal to you.
If you are good at a subject, like math, offer to help another student that is struggling in that subject.
Pick up messes when you see them. Offer to help teachers or students that are carrying too much. Actions get you noticed and make you a good role model.

, A good way to get noticed at school by your peers and teachers is to join a club. Joining a club or organization at your school is a way to get to know a diverse group of people, learn a skill that you can talk to people about, and get recognized in the yearbook. Becoming a part of a club will require you to spend more time at school, which will make you more recognizable.The yearbook club is a great club to become a part of because you work with others, take pictures of students, and talk with students and teachers.
Choose a club based on your interests. You will meet other people like you and learn skills that you can carry with you throughout your education. Some clubs to consider are the tech club, art club, world language club, and the band or choir., Joining a team is a great way to meet other people and get recognized as a member of that team around school. Becoming a part of a team usually requires a tryout. If you get a spot on team, you will need to commit to practices, games, or shows. Teams usually require more dedication than a club. So choose a team that you are genuinely interested in.If you are interested in sports, consider the football, basketball, lacrosse, or soccer team. Check what sports teams your school has.
If you are interested in academics, consider becoming a part of the debate, math, or chess team.

, Taking part in many or all events that your school offers is way to get recognized. The type of events offered depends on your school. Many middle schools, however, will hold dances, holiday events, concerts by the band and choir, and sometimes festivals for the beginning/end of the school year. Attend as many events as possible.Go to the event with a friend if you don’t want to attend the event alone.
Try to start conversation with other people attending about the event.

, Try out a hobby that you can practice outside of school. Often, if you work hard at the hobby, you will be known as the girl or boy that is really good at or into whatever the hobby may be. You may already have a hobby you enjoy, but if not, there are many hobbies to choose from. Becoming invested in a hobby is also a great way to meet others with similar interests.Try making jewelry, like bracelets and earrings, and giving them out to people at school. You can buy supplies at your local craft store, like Michael’s or Hobby Lobby.
Some other hobbies to choose from are dance, cooking, painting, writing, films, and gaming.

Call Comcast and mention the discounts of competitors to their representative.,
Inform Comcast that you are considering cancelling your service.,
Receive confirmation of any changes to your contract.",How to Get a Discount from Comcast2," In some cases, Comcast will work with you to save money on your existing services by offering you the discount.


If Comcast is not initially willing to provide you with a discount, mention the amount of time you have had Comcast as your provider. If you have been with Comcast for over 1 year, Comcast may view you as a loyal customer and provide you with the discount.
If you have always paid your Comcast bills on time, mention this factor to Comcast; as this may also demonstrate your loyalty to their company.

, This strategy can be used if Comcast is not willing to work with you regarding a discount; especially if the same discount is being offered by their competitors. You may then be transferred to a Comcast retention specialist, who will most likely offer you additional discounts or promotions to keep your business.


This is another important moment in which you can bring up the cost or advantages of a competing company's plans. Explain to what extent the convenience of using the other company's services makes their offer more attractive. Try to make this point early in the conversation, as this will force them to begin providing counter offers from the very beginning.

, Make sure to receive a confirmation number--either as stated by the customer service agent or sent to your email--before you hang up. Comcast agents do not have the best track record of customer service, and there are many noted instances in which the promises given over the phone have not fit with the bills that customers receiver later.Like most service providers, Comcast has a customer retention department that deals specifically with customers who threaten to cut their service or switch to a competitor. These agents are trained to be somewhat difficult to work with, but they also have the right to provide certain offers that are not widely available otherwise.If you can be extremely patient with them, you can get a deal.

Backup your iPhone!,
Gather all of the tools you will need.,
Look at the bottom of your iPhone (the side with the home button) and locate the 2 screws on either side of the USB connector.,
Remove the screen using one of these methods:


Use a wedging or scraping tool.,
Look for flaps in the top right holding the screen and phone together.,
Look for a third sticker under the #2 flap.,
Remove 6 more screws.,
Separate the LCD screen from the glass.,
Clean the metal frame from the broken glass.,
Prepare your new screen.,
Start reassembling your iPhone.,
Put the 6 screws back that we took out before.

,
Slide the #3 cable back into the clamp, making sure the clamp is open.,
Put the #2 and #1 cables back on by simply pressing them onto the connector.,
Put the screen back onto the phone.",How to Fix an iPhone 3G Screen," Connect it to your computer, browse to your iPhone in iTunes, and click ""Sync."";
, All these materials can be bought online in packages. A simple Google search, ""iPhone screen repair kit"", will produce you many results to choose from. Also, stores such as Zellers and Walmart carry all the materials except for the screen. Ordering the materials offline will ensure that you get the correct size and type if you are uncertain. Here is what you need:


A replacement glass.
A #00 Phillips screwdriver
A razor blade, or other wedging and scraping tool
Rubbing alcohol and Q-tips, and/or a hair dryer or heat gun
Double-sided tape and scissors, or superglue
Optional: A small suction cup
Optional: Tweezers

, Use a #00 Phillips screwdriver to unscrew both of these. (Note that you don't need to remove the SIM card in order to open the phone, as mentioned elsewhere on the web.)

, A razor blade works well. Put the razor blade between the rubber and metal and lift the screen. The screen will still be attached to the iPhone so be sure to read the next step to be prepared.






Use a suction cup. Instead of using a scraper tool or a screwdriver which can damage the rubber surround, use a small suction cup. Place the suction cup right above the home button and gently pull up. The glass will pull right out with no damage to the surrounding rubber gasket (assuming the glass is not broken too badly to get a seal).

, You will see labels 1 and 2 on bright orange stickers on these flaps. Lift these flaps with your wedging tool. (Note: The #2 sticker on the phone used in this tutorial fell off.)

, This one is a little different from the other two. You will need to lift the black ""clamp"" to release the #3 connection. Once the clamp is lifted, the screen will be free from the rest of the iPhone, simply pull it out.

, There are 5 screws on the side rails: 3 on the side with the flaps and 2 on the other side. The 6th screw is in the top right. All 6 of these screws are the same, so you don't need to worry about keeping track of which went where. There is black tape over some of the screws in this step. The black tape is not needed, so you can use your razor blade to cut off the tape covering each screw head.

, Put your wedger in between the rails and wedge the inner piece out. The LCD will need to slide down towards the Home button to clear the top flanges. Don’t be afraid to apply a little pressure as the metal will not get deformed. This step will free the LCD screen from the metal frame.

, This step is the hardest part and will take a while, but make sure it is done well so the new screen fits snug. The specific approach to take will depend on how the glass broke, but don’t be scared to use force as long as you are not greatly bending the metal/plastic frame because you will reuse it. Use your razor blade or other wedging device to scrap away stuck pieces of glass and leftover residue of the former adhesive. Some people recommend using a heat gun or hair dryer, but be careful as this can deform the frame if it is torqued while applying heat. In that case you will have to heat it again to reform it. The adhesive does dissolve with rubbing alcohol, so try swabbing that on with a Q-tip and then working at it with the razor blade.


Be careful not to cut yourself! And if you get any tiny glass shards in your fingers or skin, read How to Remove a Splinter.

, If you have double sided tape, make sure it is cut out correctly. If you have super glue, make sure when applying it that you do not apply too close to the home button. Only apply adhesive, whichever one it may be, to the wide black plastic on the bottom or top, staying away from the middle. You don’t want to glue the home button or the listening piece on the top. Let adhesive set for a few minutes to make sure it is set. If you use double-sided tape, consider using tweezers to manipulate it so that you don't get your finger oils all over it, diminishing its stickiness. Be sure to remove the protective plastic on the new glass where it will touch the tape.

, Put the LCD and glass back together. There are two ways the screen can go and only one is correct. On one side, the rail is longer than the other, so that's a quick way to match it. You may find it easier to slide the LCD in from the bottom so the little clamp slides on nicely.

,, This step is easier if you push the #3 down to straighten it out a bit, then hold the #2 and #1 cable with your thumb. Once you have the #3 cable reinserted, press down the black clamp.

, Don’t worry about using a little bit of force or missing the connector a few times as it is bound to happen.

, Start by inserting the top, the side with the connectors, then place the bottom in. It should fit in nicely, avoid using force. After the screen and LCD are nice and snug, put the last 2 screws into their places on either side of the USB.

These cats won’t make too much noise. For example, they won’t meow loudly for food or attention.
Instead of meowing or making noises, the cat may raise its paw to gain your attention., Many pixiebob owners comment that the cat is almost dog-like when it comes to its loyalty and devotion to its family. Thus, when you’re trying to identify the pixiebob, watch to see if its behavior is somewhat like a dog.


They may be taught to walk on a leash or harness.

Put a hamster that you suspect is hibernating in a warm room.,
Warm the hamster up, relatively rapidly.,
Remember that hibernation is a natural process.,
Remember that hamsters have relatively short lives.,
Prevent the hamster from hibernating in the future.",How to Cure Your Not Moving Hamster3," The room temperature should be around 20°C. Wait for 2 - 3 days. If the hamster is merely hibernating it should wake within that period. If it doesn't wake up, then more obvious signs of death should occur such as an unpleasant odor and rigor mortis. A hibernating hamster should not smell unpleasant.
Experts advocate this as the preferred option of waking a hamster because it closer simulates the natural waking process and places less strain on the body's blood glucose reserves than a ""rapid reboot.""
Make sure plenty of food and water is available for the waking hamster.

, Instead of warming up your hamster slowly in a warm room, you can warm it more rapidly. Put the hamster, in its cage, in a warm place such as an airing cupboard. Depending on the temperature, the hamster may wake within 2 - 3 hours.


Remember to keep the hamster in a secure container, because if it is just in a cardboard box it may wake and chew its way out!
Another idea is to stand the cage on a hot water bottle to radiate heat up through the floor of the cage.
Ensure the hamster has food and water, because it will use up valuable energy reserves to wake up, and these need to be rapidly replaced or the hamster could suffer liver damage.

, If your hamster was hibernating, be aware this is a natural process, from which it recovered. Unless you are concerned, if the hamster is back to hits usual self - eating, grooming, and running in its wheel - there is no specific need to get it checked by a veterinarian.

, If none of your attempts help to wake the hamster up, it has probably passed away. Remember that hamsters generally have very short lives and their time might unfortunately be up. Eliminate all other possibilities first, but then you may need to accept that your hamster has died.

, So that you don't have to suffer this anxiety and worry again, make sure the hamster is always in a room above 20°C, that he has 12 hours + light a day, and plenty of food and water. That way his body never thinks he has to conserve energy and hibernate.

Decide if you want to get remarried at all.,
Consider getting to know someone as a friend before you date.,
Wait as long as possible to have sex.,
Think about moving in together before marriage.,
Keep in mind that rebounding can be healthy.",How to Avoid Marrying on the Rebound3," Keep in mind that marriage is not the only option for a long-term relationship. Many couples are opting not to get married at all.If you are worried about marrying someone on the rebound, then keep in mind that you have the option to have relationships without marriage.


If someone is pressuring you to get married, then try saying, “I care about you, but I am just not interested in marriage right now.”

, Emotional intimacy is the most important factor in a successful relationship.You should be able to talk to your partner about anything. One way to develop emotional intimacy is to spend time talking to the person. Spend time with your significant other as you would with a friend.


For example, you might go for coffee with the person and ask questions to get to know him or her better. Once you get past basic details, such as family, hobbies, likes, and dislikes, start asking about more personal things, such as dreams, fears, and life goals.

, Having sex within the first month of a relationship has been linked with lower quality relationships.Therefore, it is best to wait for as long as you can to become physically intimate with someone.


Try to wait for at least a month to have sex with someone you are dating. If he or she asks why you are declining invitations to have sex, you can say something like, “I just really like you and I want to get to know you better first.”

, Living with your significant other before you consider marriage might be a good opportunity to determine whether or not you want to get married to your significant other. Despite the findings of previous studies that indicated cohabiting was bad for relationships, more recent studies have shown that cohabiting before marriage can increase a relationship's stability and quality.Cohabiting also has other benefits that are similar to marriage, such as in increased sense of well-being, better health, and more social connections.If your partner is interested in moving in together, then you might want to consider it. It may help you to determine whether or not you want to marry this person.

, Although there are lots of negative possibilities associated with rebounding, there is also some evidence that rebounding is healthy for some people. Rebounding can help you to move past your ex more quickly than staying on your own for a long period of time.While you should still be cautious about remarrying, don’t be afraid to get into a new relationship.
There is no evidence that waiting to form a new relationship is healthier than forming a new relationship right away."

Be persistent from the beginning.,

Provide clear cues to your horse.",How to Ride a Lazy Horse2," If your horse does not have the speed or impulsion you want from the beginning of the lesson, do not settle for a slower pace. Make a constant effort to make your horse move forward. Make it clear that you will not take “no” for an answer. Don’t be overly aggressive, but make sure that your horse knows exactly what you want. Do not kick aggressively, yell, or slap your horse with your crop too hard. Squeeze with your legs and keep light contact.

, If you ask your horse to trot and he continues walking, do not stop asking for the trot until you get the trot. If you ask your horse to trot and he gets away with not trotting, he will know that he can get away with it further into your ride, too. Be persistent.

, Make sure that you are asking for what you want correctly. Ask your trainer or a more experienced rider friend to watch you ride your lazy horse and evaluate your use of the aids. Are you using your leg correctly? Are you pulling his mouth too much?The use of aids differs for every discipline, so your use of the aids will be different depending on whether you ride hunt seat, dressage, or western.
Ask your trainer for tips on encouraging your horse to move forward.

Communicate about what is going on.,
Be open and honest with people.,
Treat people kindly.,
Avoid spreading rumors yourself.,
Be clear about what you are sharing.,
Don't take it personally.,
Respond to the rumor quickly.,
Find the source of the rumor.,
Make it known the rumor was false.,
Understand that it may take time for the rumor to fade.",How to Deal With Rumors," Rumors can spread if someone is very secretive about their life or isn't in constant communication with others. You don't have to tell everyone you meet what is going on in your life, but to prevent rumors it can be helpful to tell some people how you are doing and what is happening. Then, when a rumor gets spread it may be harder to believe because people know what is truly happening in your life.Stay in touch with your close friends, coworkers, and family. Keep them up to date on your life and ask them about theirs. When someone begins to pull away from people and becomes distant, rumors can be spread more easily. People can get upset if they feel like someone isn't putting in the effort to spend time with them and they can create rumors just from that. Or, if you look distant, people can start to create ideas that you are forlorn, depressed, or unsociable and can spread rumors about your emotional state.;
, This goes hand in hand with communication, but it involves really being honest and open with people, even when things are hard. Many people, when struggling with difficult things either at home, at school, or at work, can begin to pull away from people and become stressed and distrusting. The best way to avoid rumors when you are experiencing these things is to be vulnerable with a few people around you. Explain that things are hard or you are unsure about some things, and those around you will hopefully be understanding and sympathetic.
Another reason to be open and honest with people is it helps create a space where they feel it's safe to be open and honest with you. If you share information with people they are more likely to share information back. Then, they are less likely to spread rumors about you because they know you have information on them.
At the same time, you want to be careful about who you share intimidate details of your life with. If you know it is someone you can trust, then be open and honest with them so that they know what is truly going on in your life. If it is someone you are not sure about, still try to be honest with them, but don't reveal secrets that they may twist into something that isn't true. Some people will take honesty and vulnerability and use it for harm, as awful as that is.

, Not all rumors start from your close friends or family. Many start from people that don't know you well and so it's easy for them to make up lies about you. This is why it's important to treat all people kindly. The kinder you are to people, the less likely they will be to react out of malice and try to harm your reputation. Even people that are difficult to treat well, you should strive to at least be kind to them.


Some people spread rumors about people they don't know well because they feel those people have treated them poorly, even if that person didn't intend to. You can't always prevent this, but being kind to someone decreases your chance that they are going to target you as their source for a rumor.
If you are experiencing rumors in a workplace, encourage cooperation over competition. Building an environment where you treat your coworkers as a team and a family is going to make people feel more comfortable and welcomed, and hopefully they won't feel a need to spread unnecessary rumors about others., Don't spread rumors. It's just that simple. If you spread rumors yourself and contribute to hurting other people and harming their reputation you are more likely to have a rumor spread about you. You also have placed yourself in a position where you can't exactly find fault with others if they spread a rumor about you. If you do the same thing with others, then you are no better than someone who has spread a rumor about you.


If information is told to you and it seems harmful or like it could hurt someone's reputation, keep it to yourself. Even if you don't think it is harmful, but you aren't sure of it's accuracy, don't spread the information. Unless you are confident that the information is true and the person it is about won't experience harm from it, then don't tell others about it.

, If you are sharing something in confidence with someone and don't want others to know, make sure that person understands. Some people will share what other people have told them, not out of malice, but because they saw no harm in it. If you want to keep something private, communicate that to the person you are talking with.


Doing this will keep your friend from sharing your private information with someone else who may share it with someone else incorrectly. It is like the game of telephone -- you start off with a sentence and after it has been passed between several people the meaning changes. To prevent this from happening, be clear with your friend that you want this information to stay between the two of you.

, Some people live life in bitterness or malice, and will spread rumors because they think it will make them feel better about themselves. Others hear information incorrectly and without meaning to harm someone, will spread that information. Either way, rumors aren't usually a sign that you have done something wrong. They usually communicate that the people spreading them are struggling with insecurities or boredom, so don't take it personally.


While this can be difficult to do because some rumors can be very hurtful, just remember that people spread rumors for a reason. Most people who are kind and care about others won't spread malicious rumors to harm someone. Those who spread rumors usually do so because they feel jealousy or envy towards you, or they are upset with their current state in life and want to add some drama to it to make it more interesting.
Stay above these rumors and don't encourage them by taking them personally and getting really upset. Some people spread rumors just to get a rise out of someone else. When rumors start to spread about you, act like nothing has happened and that you aren't affected by these lies. This can also help show people that the rumor isn't true, because you think it's so ridiculous that you don't even see a need to be upset about it.

, When a rumor is told about you, the best thing to do is respond to the rumor quickly. If you allow the rumor to fester and continue to be spread it may become worse or more exaggerated. Talk to the people who you have heard spread the rumor and explain to them that it is false, or go to an authority and let them know that the rumor isn't true. Some people choose to ignore rumors instead of responding to them. This can be a good option, depending on the extent of the rumor. If the rumor is something so outlandish that very few people actually believe it, it could be good to just ignore it and over time people will stop talking. However, if the rumor is believable or is something that could get you into trouble, you need to address it quickly. You don't want to end up in a position where you are at fault because others have spread lies about you.
For example, if there is a rumor going around your workplace that you haven't been working efficiently or are doing something against company policy, you should address that rumor quickly. If not, you may be in great trouble with your boss. You want to denounce a rumor by addressing it before you are confronted and asked if it is true. It's easier for someone to believe you when you come to them first.

, When you hear about a rumor, sometimes it's best to go to the source of the rumor to understand why it was spread. This can help you from being hurt and can also prevent you from judging someone incorrectly. As people are spreading the rumor ask them who they heard it from, and hopefully you will be able to find the source of the rumor.Once you have found the source or creator of the rumor, ask them why they spread it and where they got their information. If it was a friend, you might ask them if you did something that upset them that caused them to spread the rumor. You should also figure out if the rumor was spread in malice or because information was communicated incorrectly. Although neither are good things, someone may have spread a rumor, not knowing it was a rumor. In this case, the person wasn't doing it out of malice, so you don't want to create unnecessary drama.
If you find out someone did do the rumor out of malice, ask them why they started it. As stated earlier, people often start rumors because they are insecure about themselves. In this situation try to understand the person and practice giving them grace and forgiving them. Although this can be hard, the best way to love someone and help change them is by showing them grace when they don't deserve it. If you react kindly to this person, they may feel guilt or shame for spreading the rumor and then it may be easier to convince them to tell people the real truth.

, The best way to denounce a rumor is by proving to people that it can't possibly be true. You can do this by explaining to people what is actually true, or you can show it to them by your actions. If the rumor involves you and someone else, ask that other person to help you prove that the rumor is false. Sometimes it can be helpful to have a third party refute the rumor.If someone spread a rumor that you were cheating on your significant other, then be more faithful to them. Don't flirt with other people and spend more time with your significant other so that people begin to question the truth of the rumor.
If someone spread a rumor at your work about your laziness or that you were going against company policy, then try your best to show people you are a hard worker and that you are totally in line with company policy. Make it so hard for people to believe that the rumor is true.
While this step isn't always fun or enjoyable, because you may feel like you are having to prove yourself when you shouldn't be, it can be effective. Telling people a rumor isn't true may work, but when you show it to them, they have undeniable evidence and proof.

, Unfortunately, even if you have addressed the rumor, not all rumors fade quickly or immediately. Some people will believe you or will become uninterested while others may take some sort of twisted joy in hurting your reputation and will continue to discuss the rumor or the events surrounding it. Don't let these things bother you, but keep your head held high.


Once you have addressed the rumor, there is not much you can do except to continue living life as you were. It may take time and patience, but eventually people will have moved onto another source of gossip.

If you dyed your hair a dark color, chemical dye remover can lighten it up. Follow the instructions on the package to treat your hair with dye remover, then rinse it out and examine the results. Repeat if necessary.


Test the dye remover on a discreet lock of hair before using it on your whole head.
Chemical dye remover doesn't work on hair that has been dyed lighter; it only works to remove darker colors.
Do a deep conditioning treatment on your hair to restore it to health after using a dye remover.

, This is a natural way to remove dark color from your hair. Make a paste with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Massage it into your hair and let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse with hot water. Repeat as many times as you'd like until you've achieved the color you want.

Create the stripes with red liquid lipstick.",How to Do Candy Cane Makeup3," To create perfect candy cane lips, you want the white to be very pigmented and opaque. In order to achieve this, you want to conceal the natural redness of your lips that could show through the white lipstick. Use a makeup sponge to dab concealer over your lips, making sure to cover the entire surface.







, After applying you concealer, it’s important to set it with a powder. Otherwise, you’ll be applying lip product over a creamy base, and you’ll end up with a smudged mess. Use your makeup sponge to press the powder into your lips, covering all of the concealer.








Brush off any excess powder with a fluffy brush.

, You can purchase a white lip liner at any beauty supply store. First, outline your lips entirely. This is a helpful first step, because it will define the border that has been concealed. Instead of just lining your lips, however, you’re going to use the lip liner to fill in the entirety of your lips.







, The white lip liner creates a really nice base for a white lipstick to adhere to. Carefully apply your white lipstick over the white eyeliner, making sure that every bit of your lips is opaque. If the white lipstick you use is creamy, dab it with translucent powder when you’re finished. If the lipstick is matte, you don’t need to do this.







, After your lips are completely white, it’s time to turn them into a candy cane! For this step, you’ll need red liquid lipstick and a small lip brush. Dip your lip brush into the liquid lipstick, and start creating diagonal stripes down your lips. Let your mouth rest naturally, so you can create lines that continue from the top lip straight down to the bottom lip.








Alternate between thick stripes of red and thin stripes of red, to mimic the pattern of real candy canes.
Continue creating these stripes diagonally across your lips until they are covered.

Get a grant.If you don't want a loan, you could try for a grant.",How to Start a Kiosk Business2," Check with the mall or shopping center your kiosk is located in to find out exactly how much money you’ll need. Rates often vary depend on your location and type of business you’re running.


If you’re just renting a small cart, you probably have the necessary startup capital, which usually hovers around $600 per week. Rental costs might also be 15% of your monthly gross, whichever is greater.
Cart rental fees often vary seasonally.Buying a cart might be a good idea if, after renting for a while, you think you don’t need to scale up to a full kiosk. Be sure to go over the kiosk carefully before buying, though, to avoid purchasing something inadequate for your needs.
If you’re renting a larger kiosk, you might need a loan to cover your expenses over the first few months. Kiosk rental can be $9,000-$10,000 per month.
If you’re buying a kiosk you might need $25,000-$30,000., Regulations governing what paperwork needs to be filled out vary depending on your location and what kind of kiosk you’re running. A mall kiosk will probably help you with the necessary licensing and permits.


If you lease or buy a portable kiosk, you may need a special vehicle license for hauling it.
If you will be working with food, you will need an additional permit. Contact your state or county’s board of health for more information., Your business plan should describe your business’ vision and mission, your organizational structure, your legal framework, your financial data, and your business’ history. With a strong business plan in hand, you will have more success in securing a loan. For the purposes of getting financed, the most important sections of the business plan include:


A market analysis describing your target market, your competition, and any potential roadblocks to your business’ success
How much money you expect to bring in
How you intend to repay the loan
How long it will take to repay the loan

, You’ll also need to submit personal financial information -- tax returns, financial statements, and bank statements -- to demonstrate that you’re financially responsible.


Provide a statement about what kind of collateral you can offer against the loan, if necessary.
The loan officer might also ask for legal documents and licenses demonstrating your business is legally owned and operated.
You might also need to provide a resume to show that you have the skill necessary to run a kiosk business.
Check with the financial institution or loan program you’re applying to for a checklist to ensure you don’t omit anything from your application.

, Banks and credit unions are the most common sources for loans. The specific process for securing a loan varies depending the financial institution you apply to. However, you should always aim for a loan with a long repayment period, a low interest rate, and a low minimum monthly payment.


Alternately, contact the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for help getting funded.The SBA has many loan and grant programs available online at https://www.sba.gov/loans-grants. Explore the possibilities that might be available to you.

, A grant is better than a loan because you don’t have to pay the money back, but they are also harder to secure.


You probably won’t qualify for government grants, but you should investigate the possibility of local grants and funding for your kiosk. Many municipalities have economic development funds that might be able to help you get your kiosk off the ground.

Re-read your text.,
Look for figurative language.,
Consider the structure of your text.,
Think about character archetypes.,
Think about situational archetypes.,
Consider how action develops from conflict.",How to Study English Literature2," You should have already read the text for class, but if you’re studying for an exam, make sure you go back and re-read it to catch things you missed out on the first time.

, Many authors use techniques such as metaphors, similes, and personification to emphasize their points. These may be crucial to understanding the literary work you’re reading: for example, knowing that the white whale in Moby-Dick represents (among other things) Captain Ahab’s hubris is essential to being able to understand Melville’s novel.



Metaphors make direct comparisons between two seemingly dissimilar things. They are stronger than similes. For example, the last line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby is a famous metaphor comparing human lives to boats trying to make progress against a strong current: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”Similes also make comparisons, but they don’t directly state that “x” is “y”. For example, Margaret Mitchell uses a simile to describe Scarlett O’Hara’s interest in Ashley Wilkes with a simile in her novel Gone With the Wind: “The very mystery of him excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.”Personification occurs when a non-human animal or object is given human characteristics in order to express an idea more powerfully. For example, Emily Dickinson frequently uses personification in her poems, as in this poem about a snake: “A narrow fellow in the grass / occasionally rides; / You may have met him, -- did you not, / His notice sudden is.”Here, the snake is a “narrow fellow” who “rides” in the grass, which makes it seem almost like a dashing Victorian gentleman, rather than a reptile.

, The way that an author expresses her or his ideas is often as important as the ideas themselves. In many cases, the form and structure of the text will have some kind of influence on its subject matter.


If you’re reading fiction, think about the order in which the events are recounted. Are there flashbacks or places in the narrative that cycle back in time? Sandra Cisneros’s novel Caramelo begins close to the end of the actual “story” and switches between various times and places in order to emphasize how complicated family histories are.
If you’re reading poetry, think about the form of the poetry. What type of poem is it? Is it something formally structured, like a sonnet or sestina? Is it free verse, which makes use of elements such as rhythm and alliteration but doesn’t have a set rhyme scheme? The way the poem is written will often offer clues as to the mood the poet wanted to convey.

, An archetype is usually a character -- although it may also be an action or situation -- that is believed to represent something universally recognized as part of human nature. The influential psychologist Carl Jung argued that archetypes tap into the “collective unconscious” of humanity, and thus we recognize experiences we’ve shared with others in archetypes. Several types of of literature analysis have been influenced by Jung, so being familiar with some archetypes that may appear in your text will probably be useful.The Hero is a character who embodies good and often fights against evil in a struggle to bring justice or restore order. Beowulf and Captain America are perfect examples of the Hero archetype.
The Innocent Youth is a character who is usually inexperienced, but whom others like because of the faith s/he has in other people. For example, Pip in Charles Dickens’s novel Great Expectations is an Innocent Youth, as is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. Often, these archetypes will experience some sort of “coming of age” in later parts of the story.
The Mentor is tasked with caring for or protecting the main character through wise advice and assistance. Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is an excellent example of a Mentor archetype, as is Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars movies.
The Doppelganger is a character who doubles for the main character in order to represent the “dark side” of the hero or heroine. Common examples of doppelgangers include Frankenstein and his Creature in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson's' novel of the same name.
The Villain is a character with evil plans whom the hero must oppose. The villain will usually do anything to defeat the hero and is often, though not always, clever. Good examples include Shere Khan from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, Smaug the Dragon from The Hobbit, and the Joker from the Batman comics and films.

, The other main type of archetype you’ll probably encounter is situational, i.e., a very familiar and expected type of plot and progression. Some common situational archetypes include:The Journey. This is an incredibly common archetype and is referenced in everything from stories of King Arthur to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver’s Travels to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. In this archetype, the main character undertakes a journey -- physical or emotional, literal or figurative -- to understand something about herself/himself or the world around her/him, or to achieve an important goal. Often, the journey is very important to the plot, as with the Fellowship’s quest to destroy Sauron’s One Ring in the Lord of the Rings.

The Initiation. This archetype has similarities with the Journey, but the focus is more on the hero/heroine’s developing maturity through their experiences. This type of story may also be called a ‘’bildungsroman.’’ Henry Fielding's Tom Jones is an excellent example of this, as are the origins of most comic book heroes (for example, Peter Parkers lessons about how to handle “great power and great responsibility” as he becomes Spiderman).
The Fall. This is another very common archetype. In this archetype, the main character experiences a fall from grace as the consequence of her/his own action. Examples of this archetype are all over classic literature, including King Lear from Shakespeare’s play King Lear, Ahab from Melville's novel Moby-Dick, and Satan from John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost.


, For many texts, particularly plays and fiction, there is an “inciting incident” that sets the main action of the story in motion. This moment disturbs the equilibrium of the situation, poses a problem, and sets off a series of events that will form the rest of the story.For example, in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Macbeth hears a prophecy from a trio of witches that says he will become King of Scotland. While he has never wanted to be king until this moment, the prophecy sets him on a path of ambition and murder that eventually leads in his downfall.
As another example, in Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, a group of young girls face a conflict: they’ve been caught doing naughty things in the woods and face punishment. To try to cover up their actions, they accuse their fellow villagers of witchcraft. This action incites the rest of the play’s story, which follows these accusations as they spin out of control.

A friend may recommend an agent they have dealt with. Be sure to ask your friend if the agent was responsive,whether or not they were licensed and if the agent address their needs quickly and seriously?Ask if the person making the referral compared policy quotes from various agents, researched the type of insurance they were looking to get and whether they researched the company and agent.
This will give you a sense of whether the agent they are referring has already been screened.
You’ll still want to thoroughly vet any potential providers.;
, Listen to friends who have dealt with an agent you are considering. If it didn’t go well for them, chances are your experience with the agent or company won’t either. Also, look for online testimonials and steer clear of the agents with numerous complaints.


Finding out that a company doesn’t process a claim in a timely fashion will help you avoid that company and save you a great deal of headaches.
The experience of others, when dealing with an agent or company you are considering, may also help you keep looking until you find a company that suits your needs.

, For example, if you need homeowners insurance, you may ask a title company for recommendations. If you need health insurance, you may want to ask your trusted healthcare provider.


Keep in mind that recommendations from related professionals may be a way for the professional to get a kick-back, so be sure to check out the agent or company.
The agents they recommend may have higher premiums. It is best to compare companies and get multiple quotes.

, An independent insurance agent is not tied to one specific insurance company. They likely have several companies for whom they can provide quotes. Therefore they can help you compare rates and coverage information.If you feel comfortable that an agent will be forthright, then ask for multiple referrals.
You’ll need to be sure that the agent is making referrals to companies that offer policies with similar coverage and deductibles.
Ask questions like why they chose a particular agency and why they think that coverage is best for your situation.
With an Independent Agent, you’ll need to check the agent's credibility and on the credibility of the companies for which they provide quotes before enrolling in a new policy.
Do this through online research, word of mouth, and interviewing the agent.

, After you have done your research, it is time to make a list of agents with whom you may be interested in working. This will help you stay focused when making phone calls and setting up appointments.

, Research them online. You can check out the Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) Type this in the search bar and then search for the site that is specific to your state.The website will most likely have the information you need to answer the questions you have about the insurance policy and perspective companies.Check their rankings on business rating directories.
See if they offer products that you need.
Stay away from the ones that work with providers that you don't like. If they do, take them off your list.
The key is to ensure you get the coverage you need at the best price from a reputable company.
Make sure the agent deals with your specific issue.
A truly helpful agent will give personalized advice.

, One source is the Consumer Information Source page on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website. The link is: http://doi.wyo.gov/consumers/choosing-an-insurance-company/consumer-information-source. This should provide more in-depth information about complaints or issues than a more generic search of a company., Make sure the agents you are considering are licensed to practice in your locality. Additionally, find out what professional designations your prospective agents hold. A good insurance agent should belong to a number of professional boards and should hold professional accreditations.

, Commercial insurance addresses the needs of a business. Such needs include theft, injury, disasters and so on. You should know the difference between commercial and personal insurance.


Personal insurance will be in an individual's name.
Commercial insurance will be under a number of entities like sole proprietor, LLC, partnership, corporation.
Personal insurance insures such things as homes.
Commercial insurance insures offices, storefronts or other locations where business is conducted.
Personal lines consider premises concerns while the concerns of commercial insurance are much broader.

, After you narrow your potential agent list down to the most promising prospects, call each agent to schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss your insurance needs. Information you should find out includes the specific services they offer, whether their premiums are lower than other popular agencies and why they are placing you with a particular agency. A good insurance agent should possess the following characteristics: Knowledge. Your chosen agent should have a working knowledge of the variety of products that may be suited to your needs. If an agent doesn't have an immediate or definitive answer, that agent should be willing and able to use appropriate resources to get you an answer.
Effective communication. Insurance agents should not use a lot of industry jargon in their product and coverage explanations. You want to choose an agent who explains things on a level you can comfortably understand.
Questions. In addition to answering your questions, a good insurance agent should ask you a multitude of questions in order to identify the product offerings that best suit your needs.
Experience. Not only should your agent be experienced, but the agency should also have an established and proven history. Your agent of choice should also be experienced and comfortable working with your particular socio-economic and age sector, as these factors play a large part in determining insurance needs.

, It is important that you feel comfortable with your agent. They should not only be knowledgeable about their products, they should also have outstanding credentials. Look for their certificate on the wall. The letters behind their name represent the credentials they have earned from insurance organizations.Make sure to ask what each group of letters represents and how and where they earned them.

, There is nothing more reassuring than knowing that a professional you are dealing with has years of experience dealing with the very issue for which you sought them out.


It is still a good idea to follow all the steps mentioned to make sure they are reputable.
However, the number of years of experience the agent has working with your needs, the more knowledgeable they will be.
They will also be able to more thoroughly answer your questions and put you at ease.

, Another thing that puts people at ease is advice that is tailored to their individual needs. When you are interviewing insurance agents, make sure the agent can address the things that are important to you.


This makes you feel as if the agent is looking out for your best interest.
It also lets you know that the agent is knowledgeable about the issue they are addressing.

Be authoritative, not authoritarian.,
Speak to them politely.,
Teach empathy.,
Model conflict resolution when they are at play.,
Call your friends “friends”.",How to Help Your Toddler Make Friends2," Children with authoritative parents fare better in making friends than those with a more aggressive parenting style. Do not attempt to control your child’s every move, or else they will look to you for approval for even the smallest of tasks and they will have a hard time trusting themselves. Set limits with your children and have rational discussions with them. Avoid harsh punishments.An example of a rational discussion might be “Ben, do not throw your food on the floor. This makes a mess and mommy has to clean it. If you do it again, I will put you in timeout.”
Explain things to your toddler so they can understand and correct their behavior, rather than just getting immediately punished.

, Sometimes, your children might frustrate you, but you do not want to teach them bad habits that they could carry into their adult lives. Speak kindly to them so they will know how to speak to their potential friends.An example of speaking kindly would be to say “Josie, I know you are frustrated because you can’t have a cookie, but you cannot hit me, no matter how mad you are.” Keep an even, gentle tone when saying this.
An example of how NOT to speak in this instance would be “JOSIE! YOU ARE SUCH A BAD LITTLE GIRL! Never hit me again or I will hit you back!”
Avoid criticizing your child at all costs because they will not understand that the behavior was bad, they will just think that they are bad.
Avoid yelling or raising your voice often. Do not curse at your children.

, Children who are more empathetic find it easier to make friends than those who are more self-centered. Help your child develop a more people-focused approach and teach them that not everything is always about them. A few ways that you can teach them empathy are:Caring for their emotional needs; help soothe them when they are upset, but also allow them to soothe themselves occasionally
Showing sympathy and concern for others
Showing them physical affection
Showing positive interactions with others around you, including your partner or spouse

, Begin showing your toddler how to manage conflicts on their own by giving them the tools to do so. Helping them to build friendships won’t mean much to them unless you show them how to manage any issues that arise. Don’t force them to apologize, but do apologize for them so they learn that this is the right thing to do when they have hurt someone.For instance, if your child has made another child cry, say “Angela is crying because you took the toy from her. Angela, I’m sorry that Michael took the toy from you.”
Allow the toddlers to work out things on their own if the situation is minor and no one is getting hurt.

, In order to help your child develop friendships, you will want them to understand what a friend is. When you are with your friends, call them your friends so your child can begin to understand that concept. When your toddler is with a friend of theirs, they should call them their friend.For instance, you might say “Monica is mommy’s friend, and Joanie is your friend.”

Place the arm in a sling.,
Adjust the sling as needed.It is important to make sure that the sling feels comfortable, so you may need to make some adjustments.,
Ice the injured shoulder if recently injured.,
Shift to a hot compress after 48 hours.",How to Apply Shoulder Injury Compression Wraps2," Using a sling reduces movement of the arm and the injured shoulder while it heals.Aside from purchasing an appropriately-sized sling, you can also make one with a meter-length cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally, arranging it into an elongated triangle that can be wrapped beneath the forearm of the injured arm and secured around the opposite shoulder.
Secure the injured arm at a comfortable angle across the person’s chest (roughly horizontal), with the sling’s strap over the opposite shoulder.
Perform this maneuver as gently as possible to avoid straining the injured arm.

, The entire forearm up to the hand should be supported by the sling. The sling should not be too tight or placed too high up either. If the sling is too high, then you may experience discomfort and tension in your shoulder.

, The cold temperature will actually reduce blood flow to the injured shoulder, which can help reduce any pain and swelling following an injury. Icing with compression is more effective in reducing tissue temperature than icing alone.Wrap the ice pack in a towel or other cloth before wrapping it to your shoulder as directed previously, though with slightly less compression.
Apply the cold pack for no more than 20 minutes. For the best results, remove the cold pack after 20 minutes, let the injured area rest for 20 minutes and then reapply the cold pack for another 20 minutes.
If the injured shoulder becomes numb at any point, remove the cold pack and repeat the compression wrap process before re-applying the cold compress.
Do not apply ice directly to the surface of the skin. This can lead to an increased risk of frostbite. Always wrap the ice pack in a towel first.

, A hot compress will stimulate blood flow to the injured shoulder, which is vital to the recovery process. This will also relax the muscles and reduce any muscle pain. A hot compress can also improve the flexibility of the tendons and ligaments in the injured shoulder.Do not use a hot compress if the injured shoulder is swollen. It may cause more swelling.
Hot compresses are available in multiple forms. Some create warmth via electric power, while others need to be microwaved or simply shaken.
A rubber hot water bottle is best. Whatever you use, be careful that it does not become dangerously hot.
As with a cold press, wrap or hold the hot compress in some sort of cloth before bandaging it to the shoulder as previously directed, though again, with less compression than you had used without an icing or heating element.
Only apply a hot compress to the injured area for 20 minutes at a time.

Finish by going back over each area once more.",How to Give Yourself a Facial Massage3," Face oil helps your fingers slide easily across your face, preventing them from dragging and stretching your skin. Scented oil can also improve your mood and enhance the stress-busting properties of your massage. Apply a light layer according to the following guide:









For dry skin: use coconut or argan oil. Consider adding 2 to 3 drops of lavender essential oil.
For medium skin: almond or jojoba oil. Consider adding 2 to 3 drops of lavender essential oil.
For oily skin: jojoba oil or your favorite moisturizer. Consider adding 2 to 3 drops of lavender essential oil.

, Tension often builds up in the jaw and neck area, and massaging here will help loosen your muscles. Using the tips of your fingers, massage the area in a circular motion for one minute.









Use wide circles, sweeping from under your ears, down toward your throat, and up along your jaw line.
Press more firmly in areas where the muscles feel tight.

, Using the same wide circular strokes, massage along the sides of your jaw, past the corners of your mouth, next to your nostrils, an over your cheekbones. Close your eyes and focus on the relaxing motion of your hands on your face.








, Tension in this area can often lead to headaches, so spend some extra time here. Use a corkscrew motion to massage both temples at the same time. Move gradually in toward the middle of your forehead, then back out to the sides. Continue for one minute.







, Position your fingers at the arch of your brows. Sweep them around the outside corners of your eyes, gently move them under your eyes, and end with your fingers at the inside corners of your eyes. Continue along up the sides of your nose and along your brow lines. Repeat the motion for one minute.









Massaging here will make you feel better after a long day of straining your eyes.
Use extra oil if necessary to prevent your fingers from dragging the delicate skin around your eyes.

, If you have sinus tension, massaging your nose will help relieve it. Gently pinch the area at the top of your nose. Slide your fingers down to your nostrils. Repeat this motion for one minute.








, Gently massage each part of your face again to end your massage. By the end, you should feel relaxed and calm.

Recall the formula for slope.,
Read the components of the given vector.,
Calculate the slope.,
Recall the geometric definition of perpendicular slopes.,
Identify the reciprocal of the vector slope.,
Find the negative reciprocal.,
Write the new vector in component form.",How to Find Perpendicular Vectors in 2 Dimensions," The slope of any given line or line segment is calculated by dividing the vertical change (or the “rise”) by the horizontal change (the “run”). This can be expressed more symbolically as follows:slope=ΔxΔy{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta y}}}
;
, A vector can be written in component form as (i,j){\displaystyle (i,j)}. In this form, the first coefficient i{\displaystyle i} represents the horizontal component of the vector, or the Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x}. The second coefficient j{\displaystyle j} represents the vertical component of the vector, or the Δy{\displaystyle \Delta y}.For this article, we assume that you are given the vector in its component form. If, instead, you have the vector in angle-magnitude form, you will need to calculate the components first. For help with that, see Resolve a Vector Into Components.


, To find the slope, fill in the vector components into the formula for the slope. Specifically, you will divide the j{\displaystyle j} component by the i{\displaystyle i} component.For example, suppose you have a vector represented as (3,5){\displaystyle (3,5)}. This means that the horizontal change is 3{\displaystyle 3}, and the vertical change is 5{\displaystyle 5}. Find the slope:


slope=ΔxΔy{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta y}}}


slope=53{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {5}{3}}}



You could convert this result to a decimal, which would be 1.6. However, leaving it in fraction form will actually be easier for finding the perpendicular slope.


, Two lines (including lines, line segments, or vectors) are perpendicular to each other if their slopes are negative reciprocals.Recall that a reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a given number. For a fraction, this can mean just “flipping” the fraction upside down. The following are examples of some numbers and their reciprocals:


5{\displaystyle 5} is the reciprocal of 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}.


23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} is the reciprocal of 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}.


1{\displaystyle 1} is the reciprocal of 1{\displaystyle 1}.




, After you have calculated the slope of your vector, find the reciprocal of that slope.Using the example that was started above, the vector with components (3,5){\displaystyle (3,5)} has a slope of 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}}.

The reciprocal of 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}} is 35{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{5}}}.


, If the slope of the original vector is positive, then the slope of the perpendicular vector will have to be negative. Conversely, if the slope of the original vector is negative, then the slope of the perpendicular vector will be positive.In the working example, the original slope was 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}}, so the slope of the perpendicular vector must be −35{\displaystyle -{\frac {3}{5}}}.


, Knowing the slope is almost the final step. You then need just to rewrite the vector in its component form, using the “rise” and “run” components.For the working example, the new vector will be (5,−3){\displaystyle (5,-3)}.

Be a good listener.,
Change the subject.,
Cut off the conversation politely.,
Set limits on how long you will listen to her talk.,
Do not call her back right away.,
Let her know you are uncomfortable with the discussion.,
Make time for just the two of you.,
Suggest a girl’s night out.,
Include her boyfriend in social events.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Constantly Talks About Her Boyfriend," Though you may find it difficult to pay attention to what your friend has to say about her boyfriend on a constant basis, you should still strive to be a good friend and be a good listener. Being a good listener does not mean sitting there passively and nodding at everything she says. Instead, you should try to be an active listener who asks questions and engages with your friend. This will allow you to feel part of the conversation and make it feel less one-sided.For example, your friend may start discussing her latest date with her boyfriend. You may then respond by asking questions like, “Where did he take you?” or “What did you do?” Asking a few questions will show your friend that you are trying to engage in the conversation with her and listen to what she has to say.;
, Once you have felt you and your friend had talked enough about her boyfriend, you should attempt to change the subject. Try to bring up something that happened during your day or what you did the night before. You may share this by saying, “Let me tell you what I did last night,” or “I had a really good day today.” Your friend should then take the cue that it’s time to change the subject and focus on something else besides her boyfriend.


You may also try to change the subject subtly by piggybacking off something your friend has said about her boyfriend. For example, perhaps your friend mentions that her and her boyfriend went to a great restaurant the other night. You may then say, “Oh, I went there last week. I was hanging out with Molly and…”. This could then allow you to shift the conversation to another topic in a subtle way.

, If your friend is really deep into her new relationship, she may not take the hint and continue to go on about her boyfriend, despite your attempts to change the subject. If this is the case, you may have to politely cut off the conversation so you do not become frustrated or upset. Doing this will save you from having to hear about her boyfriend and also really make it clear you want to talk about something else.For example, you may say, “You know, I have to get going. Thanks for the coffee, let’s get together next week!” Or you may politely say, “I’m late for class. Let’s catch up tomorrow?”
Cutting off the conversation politely will give you a way out of the conversation and perhaps signal to your friend that you are getting tired of listening to all the details of her relationship.

, For the sake of your sanity and your friendship, you may decide to set a limit on how long you will listen to your friend talk about her boyfriend. This may be 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or 10 minutes per a conversation. You may keep this limit to yourself and then enforce it once you have reached it. Setting limits will allow you to still be a good friend and support your friend’s new relationship without sacrificing too much of your time or energy.You may also set limits on how often you listen to your friend talk about her boyfriend on a weekly basis. You may decide to spend time on that particular conversation twice a week or only once a week. This may mean you spend less time with friend for at least the first few weeks of her new relationship until she settles into it and talks about it less.
There are many different ways you can enforce the limit you set on your friend's talking about her boyfriend. You can try changing the subject to another topic. You can also move the conversation to something about your surroundings, like the food you're eating or the bird you see in a tree. You can also take a break from talking for a little bit. You can also just say that you want to talk about something else or that you don't want to talk about her boyfriend anymore. You can also leave the situation entirely. You should decide which of these options to take based on your relationship with your friend and the situation you're in at the time.

, You can also set boundaries by giving your friendship some space and breathing room. This may mean not calling or texting your friend back right away. Or, you may set her call aside and make a plan to call her back when you are ready to talk about her boyfriend. Doing this can help you control how often you hear about her new relationship.For example, you may notice your friend has called you in the morning. You may then put off calling her back until the evening when you have set aside an hour of time to talk. You may then call her back and say, “Okay, I have an hour to chat before bed. What’s up?”

, If your friend continues to talk too much about her boyfriend, you may need to sit her down and have a discussion with her about how you are feeling. You may have the chat in person and in a private location, like your home or in a park outside. Bring up the topic with her and be honest about how you are feeling. Communication is key to a good friendship.For example, you may start the conversation by saying, “I value you as a friend and I want us to stay friends. But I am having trouble with how often you talk about your boyfriend. I am interested in hearing about your relationship but I also think we should talk about other things and share other things happening in our lives. How do you feel about this?”
Try to keep the conversation open and honest. Listen to your friend’s response and work together to come up with a solution to the issue. As friends, you should be able to share constructive feedback about how you are acting and be honest with each other.

, You can also deal with your friend’s intense interest in her relationship by trying to still make time for the two of you to hang out, one on one. Spending time together can allow you to build memories that do not have anything to do with her relationship. It will also give you a way to shift the focus from her relationship to your friendship.When you are making plans with her, you should make sure you choose a specific date and time for the hangout. Avoid making vague plans, as these could then change due to plans she might have with her boyfriend.
For example, you may say, “How about we get together on Friday night at 7 pm for dinner?” or you may say, “What about hanging out after school tomorrow?” Put the hangout in your calendar and commit to it so you get time together, just the two of you.

, Another way you can focus on your friendship is to plan a girl’s night out. This could be with other girlfriends you have and exclude any boys, including your friend’s boyfriend. Having a girl’s night can allow you all to hang out and make memories together, separate of your other relationships.You may try to collaborate with your friend on the girl’s night so she is involved and invested. You may ask her advice on what to do or where to go as a ground. You may plan the night together so you can also spend time together one on one.

, Though you want to make sure there is enough time for your friendship, you should not disregard your friend’s relationship when you are planning social outings. If the social outing is not a girl’s only night, you should make an effort to include your friend’s boyfriend. Inviting him will show your friend that you do not have a problem with him and are supportive their relationship.She also probably won't talk about him a lot during the time you're all together, because he will be right there.

Know the ingredients in your products.,
Eat a hair-healthy diet.,
Manage your stressors.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Grow Longer Hair3," Just how skin is different, so is hair. Keeping your hair clean and healthy with the right products sets it up for quicker growth.

Some types of hair respond poorly to silicone, which is found in most anti-frizz products. Try a number of products and see what works best for you.
Don't feel the need to wash your hair every day. Good, natural oils need to build up in your hair--rinsing them away dries out your hair and scalp.

Do a deep treatment. In addition to shampooing and condition, deep treat your hair a couple of times a month. The extra proteins ensure hair health and shine.

, This generally means foods high in iron, zinc, and vitamin C. A hair-healthy diet is a body-healthy diet. What's good for you is good for your hair.


Feed your strands iron-rich foods like spinach, beans, and meats. It's essential for oxygen getting to your hair follicles.
Ensure your hair has the building blocks to grow with protein-heavy foods like fish, eggs, nuts, and soy products. Hair is mostly keratin, a protein in itself.
Zinc keeps your hair from damaging. Whole grains, oysters, peanut butter, and seeds are all good sources.
Add more fruits and vegetables to your diet. They contain vitamins A, C and E, all of which have antioxidants that help maintain scalp and hair health.
Never, ever, ever crash diet. Refusing to give your body the essential nutrients it needs not only makes you feel weak and lousy, but it will stunt your hair and nail growth and make your skin appear dull.

, Eating well, exercising regularly, and getting a good night's rest are all huge factors in staying stress-free. Intense stress of any kind can lead to all sorts of physical symptoms--including reduced or stunted hair growth.


Your body only has so many nutrients. Unfortunately for your hair, it's not a top priority. Your brain and other vital systems get first dibs. Taking care of your body first allows your body to take care of you in return.
Exercising regularly produces higher levels of endorphins. Higher levels of endorphins lead to lower levels of stress. If you won't walk your dog for his sake, walk him for your hair's.

, If you have noticeably slow hair growth, you may have a medical issue that can be dealt with.


Genetics or family history can also be a player in health and hair growth. Ask your family if any patterns exist in your family's health history.
Slow hair growth or hair loss may be due to medication. Discuss the side effects of the prescriptions you're on with a medical professional. Often, alternatives can be found.
Get checked for a scalp infection. These are easily treated and hair growth will return to normal once addressed.

Learn why prejudice exists.,
Reach out to people who are different.,
Recognize when you're judging someone.,
Figure out the roots of your prejudice.,
Accept your true self does not have to be prejudiced.",How to Stop Being Judgmental and Prejudiced1," This can help you understand the roots of your thinking. Studies indicate people are born with an innate tendency to be drawn to those similar to them and judge those who are different. One study showed a 3-month old baby preferred people who ate the same cereal she did, and distanced herself from those who did not.Say you are religious and have been married for 20 years. You meet an unmarried couple in an open relationship. As this is different than your lifestyle and preferences, you may have a knee-jerk response that this is ""wrong.""
This is not that different than the baby's reaction to cereal. These people have different values and preferences than you. While this lifestyle may not work for you, does that mean it's wrong? Categorizing it in a negative fashion could be a biological response.;
, Once you understand the irrational nature of prejudiced thoughts, actively challenge your assumptions. When you find yourself judging another person, stop and ask yourself, ""Where is this thought coming from?"" and ""Is this thought fair?"" Then, you can make an effort to get to know the person you're judging.When meeting someone whose behavior or appearance does not fit with your preconceived notions of ""normal,"" be hyperaware of how you feel. Are you making any assumptions? Are these assumptions rational? Are they fair?
Instead of passing judgement, reach out. If there's a co-worker in your office who has a different religion than you, get to know her. The more you learn about people from different countries, cultures, races, and religions, the more you will see your prejudice is not rational. With practice, you can actually abandon some prejudicial responses adopted early in life.

, Even if you work hard to be aware, you will still judge people. Unfortunately, most people have days where they pass judgements, whether they mean to or not. The best way to deal with this is to work actively on being aware.Remind yourself of what you do not know. People have a natural tendency to want a full picture, and we fill in the gaps with people we do not know. Often, the information we use to fill in these gaps comes from stereotypes based on things like race, class, religion, and so on.
For example, say you see someone in tattered clothing getting on the subway at night. You may assume he is homeless, and will therefore bother you. Stop. This man may not be homeless, for one, and if he is, he may not be asking for money. Take a deep breath and think, ""I do not know this person. I cannot predict his behavior.""

, Do you pass judgement on a particular group of people? If so, why? If you can figure out the roots of prejudiced thoughts, this can help you see how they are irrational. For example, say you believe all members of the opposite sex are irrational, controlling, and manipulative. Where does this come from? Maybe you had a difficult relationship with your parent of the opposite sex. Maybe you've dated people of the opposite sex who have been difficult. When confronted with this, you may think, ""Well, yes, but most men/women I meet tend to be difficult."" Is this really true though? There's something called a confirmation bias. When we have deep-seated beliefs about a group of people, we see those beliefs reflected in innocent actions. Your co-worker Jamie offers to help you on a project, and you think, ""Of course, he/she just has to be in control."" Is this really true or are you projecting your own prejudice? Maybe Jamie is just trying to help.
Look for any past experiences you have that are affecting how you judge a large group of people. Try to be aware when your past experiences are influencing your current opinions.

, We all want to believe we have a ""true self"" deep down that completely reflects who we are as a person. The truth about what constitutes you is vastly more complicated. Just because you have the capacity for prejudiced beliefs does not mean you are doomed to prejudiced thought patterns.You may have some knee-jerk prejudices. These may be innate, or may have been learned over time. While this is unfortunate, should you really define yourself through your impulses alone? Our actions and choices make up a great deal of who we are as well.
Your ""true self"" is a combination of natural tendencies, experiences you have had, and the choices you have made. If you're actively working against prejudiced thoughts each day, this speaks more to your true self than knee-jerk reactions. Contrary to popular belief, people do have control over their true selves.

Teach them tips for avoiding fire emergencies.Don't assume they already know something or they cover it at school.",How to Teach Children Fire Safety," But if taught basic fire facts, they will be able to protect themselves. Here are some interesting facts:


More than half of fire related deaths happen to children under 4 years.Fire injuries decrease in the middle ages, but increase again in their teens.African-American children are more prone to have fire accidents.Boys receive more injuries from fires than girls do.;
, While you don't want to scare your child or make the possibilities sound like a horror movie, you do want to make sure they know what dangers fire brings. Talk about general safety often; you can talk one-on-one in discussions about what to do in emergencies, and you can bring the issues up more casually too, as you talk about movies, games, and make-believe.


Make sure your kids know, from a very young age, about policemen and firefighters. By focusing on these fun, kid-friendly icons, you can reinforce the general ideas about safety. When you and your child use toys or props to ""play firefighter"", you're actually building their understanding of fire safety, which is a good thing!

, You want your child to take the topic very seriously, but you also don't want to scare them. Anything practiced in play has the power to become ""learned"" and habitual; if you practice escape routes around your house as part of a firefighter game, they just might use those routes again in the event of a real emergency.

, Tell your kids two ways to escape from their room and that to get out as soon as possible.


Ensure that your kid can escape and check the windows can be opened. Place escape ladders and ropes near windows and balconies.

, When there is a fire it will be dark and hard to navigate the house. You can blindfold your kid to simulate the situation.

, As annoying as songs are, changing the lyrics to your child's favorite nursery rhyme might be the thing that saves their life.

, According to studies, some kids are so stupid actually know what fire alarms do. Ensure your kids know that fire alarms alarm you about fire, how to recognize the sound they make and to make sure that the batteries haven't gone flat.

, They should get out as quickly as possible and go to the meeting area. If there are any pets or people inside your children can leave them to die.

, Tell your kids not to open doors if they are hot because it can spread the fire and that it is stupid to go to a room with fire in it.


Children must know to never touch hot door handles and if they do need to, use a towel or other piece of cloth. The cloth can also double up for face and respiratory protection.

, Teach them to crawl on the floor escaping a fire and roll if they are on fire.


Tell your kids to never run if they are on fire, this only makes it worse.

, Kids are pretty stupid, so go over what they know on fire safety each month.

, Call up your local fire brigade and ask to book an appointment. It this a great opportunity for them, especially since many kids are scared of fire fighters.


Remember that fire fighters might get called to a fire and have to cancel your appointment.

, Ask your kids to do a poster or essay about fire safety. Get them to cover how to escape and what to do in a fire.

, There are many great fire safety books, many of which will be at your library. Here are some you should read:


No Dragons for Tea: Fire Safety for Kids (And Dragons)
Stop Drop and Roll (A Book About Fire Safety)
Fire! Fire!
Home Safety

, Many fire related things are red such as fires, fire extinguishers, fire hydrants and fire trucks. Get them to brainstorm and draw any other things that are red. You can even give them a red reward to keep the red theme going.

, Walk them around the school and point out the fire exits. Tell them that fire exit signs are everywhere and will always remain illuminated.

, Get your kids to run around, crawl on the floor and cover their faces. A popular game kids like is stay low and go.

, Even if kids know how to evacuate their home, schools are very different. Dramatize a fire emergency at school, you can even add obstacles and block off exits to make it more challenging. Make sure the kids know the emergency assembly area.

, Teach your kids about fire blankets, fire alarms, fire hoses, fire alarms and fire extinguishers. You can even get them to find this fire equipment around the school and get them to check they are working.

, Tell them dangerous fumes can overcome a person in just a few minutes. Practice crawling on the floor and escaping the house with them. If there are no passage ways available they will have to use a secondary escape route such as a windows or ladder, and if there is still no escape route, wait at the window for firefighters. Drill into them the famous slogans:


Don't hide, go outside
Stop, drop and roll
Fall and crawl
Do not play with matches

, Teach them your country's Emergency Services phone number and if they are old enough, that the international standard emergency number for mobile phones is 112.

, Here are the main points kids should know:


Smoke is very dangerous and that they should cover their mouth with a damp cloth.
Smoke rises and they should crawl on the floor.
Teach them the basic roles of fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, fire ladders, fire hoses and fire blankets.
Touch the door, never the doorknob, to see if it is hot. Find another exit if it is hot.
Know how to locate a Fire Exit sign and to never travel in an elevator.
Enforce the serious danger of matches and how they can injure themselves.
When evacuating never stop, even to make a phone call to Emergency Services and never go back in.
Stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch on fire.

, Make it a game and be creative with your teaching methods. Kids will be more likely to remember what to do in a fire if you do it with them. Children love Stop, Drop and Roll.

, Teach your kids facts and safety tips:


Matches and lighters are not toys.
Wear long sleeves and cover pots in the kitchen,
Check that smoke detectors are installed.
Change smoke alarm batteries each year.
Go to the meeting place when there is a fire.

Choose appropriate footwear for your outfit.,
Carry a gingham bag.,
Layer a colorful jacket over your gingham.,
Wear a belt.,
Try a matching gingham hat.",How to Wear Gingham Print3," When wearing gingham, be sure to pair your outfit with complementary footwear. The shoes you choose depend on the type of gingham you're wearing and the occasion.


Gingham patterns can go well with heels, sandals, flats, and boots. If you want, see if you can find shoes with the same gingham patterns as your outfit.Gingham also goes well with dress shoes, desert boots, and tennis shoes., Pairing gingham with gingham can be a cute look. If you carry a purse or bag with you regularly, try going for a gingham one. Try to find a gingham-patterned bag to pair with gingham clothing.Remember, when pairing gingham together, choose patterns that are either very similar or very different. Either go for a bag with a matching gingham pattern or choose a highly contrasting pattern.

, If you want to add a little splash of color to your gingham, add a jacket. Pull a bright, colorful jacket over a gingham top. This is a particularly great accessory during the cooler months.For example, wear a white peacoat over a pair of gingham pants.
Try wearing an olive green bomber jacket over a gingham shirt or blouse.

, Belts can be a flattering accessory for a wide variety of outfits. Gingham is no different. Pair a solid colored belt with your gingham attire to add something extra to your look.As bold colors pair with gingham, try a bold colored belt paired with a more neutral shade of gingham. For example, wear thick, blue belt around your waist when wearing a gingham dress.

, Matching hats can make your gingham style look cute and put together. If you're wearing gingham, see if you can find a hat with the same gingham pattern. Wearing, say, a blue and white gingham shirt with a matching blue and white fedora could be a cute look."

Ask the salesperson or the in-house repair person about the motor and the gearing.,
Decide what stitches are needed.,
Step on the foot pedal and note the smoothness of operation.,
Feel the weight and note the size of a modern sewing machine.,
Compare the size of the hand wheel of a modern sewing machine to an image of a hand wheel of a sewing machine a century ago.,
Develop a steady and precise control of the foot pedal.,
Choose a sewing machine with the largest knob available.,
Determine whether a commercial sewing machine is worth the investment.",How to Understand the Capability of a Sewing Machine," The motor and gearing for different models might be the same and the cost difference is due to the amount of stitches the expensive machine can do.;
, Besides straight stitching, the zig-zag, double-stitch, button hole, reverse feature, and a handful of other stitches are all that is necessary. From a list of sewing projects you plan to do, sometime maybe, ask which sewing machines could do those projects. Check the stitch quality. When taking a test ""drive"" of the sewing machine determine the quality of the stitching by sewing the straight stitch. A good sewing machine will produce fine, even straight stitches. A poorer quality machine will have uneven or not-so-fine straight stitches.

, An economy sewing machine will have one gear and that gear will be equivalent to a third or fourth gear in a four-speed standard transmission vehicle. The sewing machine will be be erratic at the start and when it reaches a medium-high speed it will run smoothly. A standard car can be operated from the 3rd gear and will be erratic initially and after reaching a moderate speed will run smoothly.

, The machine is compact, made of a lot of plastic and light. The hand wheel will be of great assistance when starting and at lower speeds, but the light machine will be unstable when turning the hand knob (wheel).

, The hand wheel is now so small that it should be more aptly called a hand knob. Hand fatigue will be immediate when assisting the motor when doing fine work and also when sewing through many layers. A belt carrier project, for example, is an extremely demanding job in that as many as eight layers of materials have to be sewed. This is the type of job that without a large diameter hand wheel is very difficult to do and have a nice appearance. A low gear, like the 1st gear in a vehicle, would be desirable for attaching carriers to the waistband.

, The obvious things like bright lighting, concentration, the use of reading glasses and having a helper (to shift the rest of material while the machine operator sews) all help. Fine control of the sewing machine's pedal is best done without footwear, with your ankle in a comfortable angle so fatigue will not compromise the fine control necessary.


The hand knob on the sewing machine has to be used when sewing through thick fabrics or layers. A sewing machine with a big and easy to use hand wheel (like the older sewing machines) is the vital key, for sewing with a machine with high gearing, for highly visible work besides heavy-duty work.

, Jury rig the present knob to make it turn easier or somehow replace the hand knob with a hand wheel. When choosing a sewing machine, beyond the machine having certain quality, having a usable hand wheel is the most important thing to have.

, A commercial sewing machine is costly, so for occasional use in doing sewing that normally require a commercial machine, your economy machine can do it.

Introduce your parents to your friend's parents.,
Let your parents get to know your friend.,
Call your parents if you want to be taken home.,
Let your parents know how the sleepover went.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Spend the Night," Responsibility means doing the things that need to be done. It also means being honest and reliable. All of this plays into what parents will say when you ask them for a sleepover. If you want to be treated maturely, be mature., Whether you have your parents' trust or not, permission often depends on the night you're planning the sleepover for. If you want to sleepover on a school night, parents are usually unlikely to give you permission. On the other hand, a night during summer vacation will stand a better chance. If you want to increase the chances of getting permission, you should plan to spend the night when there's nothing happening the next day.


Sleepovers are generally harder to get permission for if they're co-ed. Moms and dads can be uncomfortable if boys and girls are sleeping over together, and may have firmer rules depending on their values., It can be very difficult and slow to rebuild if it is broken. In order to have trust between parent and child, you should be talking to them every day. Let them know about everything that's happening in your life. It's good to make this a normal thing for your relationship with them. This will help a lot more than your chances for sleepovers.

, In your case, keeping up with homework and household chores will prove that you deserve to go out and let loose. If there's anything that needs to be done before you ask them make a point of doing it first. Don't let an unfinished chore be used against you when you ask to spend the night.

, As unfair as it may seem, part of what depends on whether your parents give permission is the mood you're in when they ask. If they're already upset about something before you approach, it's almost guaranteed that they will say no. This is because they do not want to deal with any added stress.


One thing you might do is see what you can do to help your parents out before asking. That way, they'll be in a better mood, and you'll have proven yourself deserving in their eyes.

, Asking your parents can be stressful depending on the kind of relationship you have with them, but it needs to be done calmly. Above all else, you need to say it in a way that isn't going to make it sound like a negative interaction. If you go into it with a pessimistic mindset, it's all the more likely your parents will deny you.


It can be good to offer a few details before asking the question. This can help avoid a quick 'no'. Say something like this: ""My friend is having her birthday tomorrow, and wanted to have a pizza sleepover to celebrate. Would it be okay if I went over there and spent the night tomorrow?""
Sitting down next to them while you ask can be a helpful trick, as it will make them feel less rushed in their decision.
If possible, it's a good idea to ask the question a couple of days in advance. Parents are usually more likely to react positively to a request in advance, rather than a last-minute plan.

, If parents are feeling nervous about letting their child out for the evening, giving them all the details will put them at ease.Giving them a run-down of the plans and things they may want to know will be a great help. Being honest and upfront about it will give you the highest chance of getting their permission. Here are some things you should tell them:


Where you'll be staying.
Whether you're planning on leaving your friend's house at some point in the evening.
What kind of parental supervision is expected. This is a big one.
Whether anyone else will be the home. That includes siblings of your friend or other relatives.
What your friend's family situation is like.

, Even if you're going to a sleepover for the sake of having fun, there are a lot of extra benefits to a kid sleeping over. Letting your parents know the benefits can ease them into thinking it's a good thing for your upbringing. Try bringing up some of these if they're having a hard time budging:Children at sleepovers learn new social skills. They have to be flexible in a new environment.
You're going to get a fresh perspective of another family during a sleepover.Try not to make this one sound like you want to escape from your own family!
A child being out of the house gives parents a chance to relax.
Sleepovers can be an enjoyable treat once in a while.

, Ask about the main issue that they're worried about, and ask what can be done to solve it. Keep your focus on finding a solution, rather than letting yourself get angry.


Popping a question about this should be straightforward and calm. Say something like: ""I understand that you may be worried over me going out tonight. What in particular is bothering you? Maybe we can find a way to fix it.""

, Contact info is important, both for the child and the parents. Your parents will want to be able to get a hold of you no matter what. Even if they never call the number it will put them at ease to have a number they can call if they don't hear anything from you.This should be the home phone of the house you're staying at, or the cell number of your friend's parents.


Don't give fake numbers. Even if you manage to make it out this time, messing around with your parents will ruin their trust and your chances for future sleepovers.

, Parents can feel helpless if their child if sleeping somewhere else. If you replan the sleepover to happen at your place, you can stand a chance of making things work. That way, you'll have time with a friend, and your parents will still feel like they're in control.Some parents are automatically against any friends staying the night at their home, so don't take this as a surefire alternative plan.

, It can be risky to ask for a sleepover once you're already there, but impromptu plans do happen. If you want a sneakier approach, you can ask to go over for dinner, as dinners are usually easier to get permission for. After dinner, you can get relaxed and call up your parents to ask. Sometimes, a parent will have an easier time giving permission for something that is already happening. If you choose this however, you should be prepared for disappointment. Some parents won't take kindly to you trying to pull a fast one under their noses.


It's a good idea to pack your sleepover things just in case.
In order for this to work out, your parents will probably have to know the family you're staying with well. It also helps if you have had successful sleepovers at that place before.

, Parents like set plans. Give them a rough idea of when you'll be back. That way, they'll be able to relax for the time being. Set plans are a good thing, as they help to fight stress and worry.


At the same time, you should be flexible with when they can pick you up. A lot of adults have a lot going on throughout their day, so it should be up to them when you are picked up the next day., If you tell them you're going to do something and do something else, you risk ruining trust. Especially if you're not used to spending the night out, it's important to show them you can be trusted.

, Part of your parents' decision depends on what they think of the friend you want to sleepover with. In most cases however, their ultimate concern is your safety. They want to make sure you'll be taken care of. That's where the friend's parents come in. If your parents can put a name to a face, it will set their minds at ease when you ask to sleepover., If your parents don't already know your friend, it's a good idea to put a name to a face. By introducing them, your parents can see that your friend isn't near as bad as they may have feared. Even unruly friends tend to be well-behaved when other parents are around.


Your parents will probably be trying to decide the sort of danger your friend may put your in. If your friend is known to be belligerent and irresponsible, you'll have a very hard time convincing them that it's a good idea to stay the night.

, By taking a leave from your own home, you need to take responsibility for yourself. That includes knowing to leave if you don't want to stay anymore.If you feel sick or don't feel comfortable spending the night anymore, call up your parents. Even if it's late, your parents will probably be happy that you decided to call rather than sit through something unpleasant. If anything, it will prove to them that you can be trusted to call out a bad situation when you see one.

, Keeping your parents up to date with everything will make them feel more at ease. When you're either picked up or get home, talk to your parents a bit about how the sleepover was. What sort of stuff did you get up to? Was it fun? What was your friend's family like to be around? All of these can help show your parents that a sleepover is a healthy activity.


Remember: You don't just want to make this sleepover work. You also want to ensure future sleepovers. Making it a pleasant experience for everyone involved will make sure you have the highest chance of more sleepovers.

Correct bad behaviors gently.,
Praise positive behavior.,
Ignore your kitten when it misbehaves.,
Do not let your kitten play with your hands or fingers.",How to Play With a Kitten2," Kittens often do not understand boundaries. When young, they may view you as a kitten. They may bite your hand or another body part during play. You should never scold or punish a kitten for this behavior. It's likely to make a kitten nervous. Instead, gently correct the behavior.When a kitten bites you, gently say, ""No."" Then, pull your hand away.
Provide your kitten with a toy to chew on instead.

, In addition to correcting bad behavior, praise your kitten for behaving. If your kitten has been pouncing on your feet when you walk by, and refrains from doing it one day, say something like, ""Good kitten!"" If your kitten sits in your lap without biting or clawing, pet and praise your kitten., If a kitten continues to misbehave after being corrected, ignore the behavior Kittens often act out because they want attention. For a kitten, any response, even a negative one, may be a positive one. Therefore, simply ignoring biting until a kitten stops is often effective., Many people play wrestle with their kitten, or allow their kitten to paw at their finger. This sends a message that biting and scratching are appropriate behaviors. This can become more of a problem as your kitten grows."

Consult with your doctor or health care provider before fasting.,
Determine the type and length of fasting you want to practice.,
Prepare for the changes that may occur in your body.,
Reduce your intake of all habitual and addictive substances 1 to 2 weeks before fasting.,
Alter your diet 1 to 2 weeks before fasting.,
Limit your diet 1 to 2 days before fasting.,
Drink lots of liquids.,
Get moderate exercise.,
Get lots of rest.,
Make sure you know the physical effects you'll experience.,
Sustain your fast.,
Make sure you know the health concerns and benefits.",How to Prepare for Fasting," There are lots of great reasons to fast, even if you don't have a medical condition, but there are potential health risks involved and it's something you should discuss with a licensed professional before jumping off into the deep end of fasting.Some medications you take may have dangerous effects on your body during fasting due to changes in your blood chemistry.
Fasting may not be ideal for people experiencing health conditions such as pregnancy, advanced cancer, low blood pressure and more. If you have any medical condition, you should check with your doctor before fasting.
Your doctor may want to conduct a urine test or blood test before the fasting period.;
, There are hundreds of different fasting practices. Some include just drinking water, some include drinking juices (or clear liquids), some are for spiritual reasons, or for weight-loss reasons, or to help with a medical condition. You'll need to sort out which is the best choice for you.Water fasting is a more aggressive type of fasting and one of the harder types. You can do it anywhere from 1 to 40 days (although 40 is definitely pushing it and not recommended without a doctor's approval). 10 days is the recommended number of days for a water fast. You'll need to begin and end with a couple day juice diet. Distilled water is the best water to drink for a water fast.
The juice fast is one of the safer bets for fasting, because you're still getting nutrients from the juices you're drinking, so it isn't as aggressive as the water fast and is more recommended. 30 days is the standard for a juice fast. You'll want to drink all-vegetable and all-fruit juices (don't mix the two) and you can have herbal teas and vegetable broth as well. Make sure that you strain the juices to avoid the fibers that will make your digestive system work harder.
The Master Cleanse is a fast that is a mix between the water fast and a juice fast. You drink a mixture of freshly squeezed lemons, water and maple syrup for about 10 days. This is an easier fast because you will still be getting some calories (although not as many as you are used to).
Fasting periods can last anywhere from 1 to 40 days, depending on your specific goal and the kind of fast you're doing (juice fast, water fast, clear liquid fast, etc) because this will determine how your body is coping with having most of its calories taken away.

, Fasting is about eliminating the toxins that have built up in your body (it will do this even if you're fasting for religious or spiritual reasons) so you're going to need to be prepared for feeling ill and weak, especially at the beginning.


Fasting may cause side effects such as diarrhea, fatigue and weakness, increased body odor, headaches and more as a result of the detoxification process.
Consider taking time off from work or relaxing more throughout the day to accommodate the effects fasting has on your body.

, The more you reduce the garbage that you intake the easier the fast will be on you and your body. So gradually stop drinking alcohol and try to cut down on or stop entirely smoking.


This procedure will reduce any potential withdrawal symptoms you may experience during the fasting process, as well as reduce the toxins in your body that the fast is going to work to eliminate.
Habitual and addictive substances include alcohol; caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea and soda; cigarettes or cigars.

, As with removing addictive substances you're going to need to make a different in your diet so that your body won't have to work as hard to get rid of the toxins and bad substances that are so apart of eating these days.A good way to ease into this, is to eliminate a few things a day (refined sugar products in the first couple days, meat in the next couple, and then dairy, etc.).
Reduce your intake of chocolate and other foods that contain refined sugar and are high in fat, like sodas, chocolate, candy and baked goods.
Eat smaller portions of meals so that your digestive system doesn't have to work as hard, and so that your body starts to become accustomed to operating on fewer calories than it usually does.
Reduce your intake of meats and dairy products, because these can clog up your system and are harder for your body to digest.
Eat increased portions of cooked or raw fruits and vegetables. These will help your process better and have fewer toxins that it wants to get rid of.

, This is when you really want to make sure that your body is prepared and this is why people can't just jump into a fast without preparing ahead of time (or if they do, they have a much harder time during the fast itself).


Eat only fruit and vegetables, because they will cleanse and detoxify your body in preparation for the fasting period.

, Drink only water, fruit and vegetables juices made from fresh, raw fruits or vegetables. You'll need to up your liquid intake during the pre-fast to help keep your system hydrated and prepare it for being only on liquid for awhile.

, You don't want to do too much exercise, but you definitely will need to do some to make sure the lymphatic fluid keeps moving and the keep the vascular system is working properly. Do some slow yoga, or go for a moderate walk.


You're going to feel tired, even on the pre-fast diet, so be aware of that, but don't worry about it. Just adjust your normal levels of activity to accommodate that tiredness.

, Whether you get enough sleep and rest is going to determine how well you do on the fast and how well you recover afterwards. Make sure that you're getting enough sleep at night and make sure that you're taking it easy during the day.


This is why it's best to plan ahead for a fast, instead of jumping in headfirst. You'll need time to recover and to rest and so you'll need to make sure that you aren't having a super busy schedule.

, The fast tends to be most uncomfortable and difficult during the first couple days and those are usually the days when people give up, but if you power through them, you'll probably start to feel better from day 3 onwards, with occasional bouts into discomfort as your body heals and purges.In the first stage (usually days 1 and 2) of the fast you may experience headaches, dizziness, nausea, bad breath, and a heavily coated tongue. These are just the signs that your body is cleansing your system of toxins. You'll probably also be incredibly hungry during this stage.
In stage 2 (about days 3 to 7, depending on the fast)) your skin might become oily and you might start breaking out a little, but your body should start adjusting to the fast. Your sinuses might go from clogged to clear several times.
Eventually, in later stages, your bowels will release their load, which can come as diarrhea or loose stool and can contain lots of mucus, especially as you don't put anything into your body for several days. Your breath will keep smelling bad until your body has rid itself of toxins. You will also probably continue to experience low energy, as your body has fewer (or no) calories to keep it going.

, A lot of times people give up in the first couple days, because of discomfort and they think that it won't get better. Unless you're having a serious medical issue (which you'll need to talk to your doctor about), breaking your fast before the finish won't benefit your body at all. There are a few things to do to make sure that you complete your fast.


Set your objective. Before you start to fast, make a clear statement on why you're doing this fast. Is it for health reasons? Is it for religious reasons? Are you trying to clear your system out? Make this a clear statement and remind yourself of your objective in the hard moments of your fast.
Make a commitment. Sometimes it can help to get a friend or trusted family member to hold you to your fast commitment. It's harder to break a fast when someone is monitoring you.
Log your fast. As you're preparing for your fast, write down each day what you eat, how you feel, and what your objective is. Do this during the fast, so that you see how your body changes and processes the change and to keep you focused on why you're doing this.
Prepare yourself physically. This means following your doctor's advice and specifically following the pre-fast and fasting rules for your preferred fast. Deviating from these can make your fasting time much more difficult and uncomfortable.

, Although there may be good health reasons for fasting, it is not a good weight-loss tool, because so often you simple gain the weight right back once you finish fasting and you can't add the healthy exercising as well.Fasting can get rid of toxins, especially for people who have diets that are low in good nutrients, like processed foods. Fasting burns through fat, which is where the body stores a lot of toxins. Fasting, when combined with improved diet may eliminate lupus, arthritis and chronic skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema and may help heal the digestive tracts of those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and help lower blood pressure
Some things to watch out for are heartburn (the stomach will produce more acid during a fast when you think about food, or smell food) so if you take medication for indigestion, you should continue to take it. You can also have trouble with dehydration during a fast, so make sure that you drink extra water and fluids. Constipation can be troublesome, as well, as you won't be exercising as regularly (or eating foods that help constipation).People who shouldn't fast are those with compromised immune systems, diabetes, kidney problems, who are pregnant, who have cardiac arrhythmia, and so on.

Learn to grow together.",How to Live a Happy Married Life," If you want to have a healthy marriage, then you have to make your spouse feel like your equal and take his feelings into account whenever you’re making a decision or just going about your day. If you treat your spouse like his opinions don’t really matter or like you always have the final say, then you’re bound to have an imbalance in your marriage. Make sure that you give your spouse’s views the same seriousness that you give your own and that you take the time to listen to your spouse and make him feel like you care.Work to be kind, loving, and understanding to your spouse. If you’re having a bad day and snap at him, make sure you apologize; give him the basic respect he deserves instead of thinking you can do whatever you want because you’re married.
You should also respect your spouse’s privacy. Don’t go snooping through his phone or computer if you expect him to feel respected.;
, If you care about your spouse and want to have a healthy and productive relationship, then you should avoid getting hung up on past mistakes you both made or keep reminding your spouse of his failures; instead, work on reinforcing positive behavior, enjoying your present time together, and thinking of all you have to look forward to. If you really care about your spouse, then you will be considerate of his feelings and won’t bring up the past just to get a reaction out of him.


Though it’s not always easy to let go of the past, you shouldn’t bring it up out of spite. Remember that your spouse is a living, breathing person too and that you shouldn’t bring up the past just to hurt him.

, Listening is one of the best ways to be considerate toward your spouse. Don’t just zone out when your spouse is talking about his day or wait for him to finish talking so you can say what you want to say; make an effort to really hear him out and to care about what he’s telling you. When you’re having a real conversation, put away your phone, make eye contact, and be considerate enough to really listen.


Of course, we all zone out from time to time. If that happens during a conversation, don’t pretend like you’re following; apologize and figure out what your spouse was really saying.
Ask your spouse questions to show that you really do care; you don’t want him to feel like he’s boring you.
Sometimes, all your spouse needs after a hard day is for someone to listen to him. You don’t have to feel compelled to give advice all the time.

, Though you don’t need to make your life revolve completely around your spouse, you have to remember that when you and your spouse decided to get married, you wanted to be a priority in each other’s lives. You should make sure to honor that decision and to make all of your big decisions with your spouse in mind, making sure that you try to do what’s best for you as well as for the person you are married to.


If your family or friends aren’t getting along with your spouse, don't take sides against your spouse, even if you think that your spouse is being unreasonable ; make sure you’re considerate of your spouse’s feelings and that you give him the love and support he deserves.

, If you want your marriage to be a happy one, then communication is key. You and your partner should be able to talk graciously to each other about your thoughts—especially about things for the two of you to agree upon or do together. Doing this daily helps foster communication and maintain trust between partners to keep your marriage healthy and strong.


Never say things in anger intentionally meaning to hurt your partner. Cruel words you said but didn't mean may be hard for your spouse to forget—they can cause lasting damage to your relationship. If you do end up saying something you don’t mean, make sure you apologize.
When arguing, keep to the subject and don't personally attack your partner.
In order to have strong communication, you have to be aware of your partner’s thoughts and moods even before you have a conversation. You should be able to read your partner’s body language and expression to be able to tell whether something is wrong and to feel comfortable bringing it up.

, If your partner trusted you with something very private and important, then you shouldn’t undermine that trust by reporting it to someone else just because you didn’t really think about it. If it was something painful and personal, then don’t use it as ammunition during an argument, or your partner will be betrayed. Be considerate of the fact that your partner trusted you with important information and make sure to honor that trust.


You should be the person your spouse trusts more than anyone in the world. Don’t do anything to jeopardize that trust. If you do make a mistake, make sure to apologize for it.

, If you sense that something is wrong with your partner, take time to embrace him and ask what's the matter—maybe that's the time he or she needs your attention the most. Don't ignore that opportunity. If your partner isn’t ready to talk, then you don’t have to push it and make things worse, but you should show that you’ll be there when he is ready and willing to open up.


If you and your partner are out in a social setting and you notice that something isn’t quite right, don’t ask about it in front of everyone; pull your partner aside to show that you’re really paying attention.

, Don’t ever think that you don’t have to say “I love you” because your partner should already know how you feel. Make an effort to tell your partner how much you love him or her at least once or twice a day and make sure you slow down, look your partner in the eyes, and say it like you really mean it. Don’t just say “Love ya!” as you leave the house or say “love you” in a text message—take the time to let your partner know how much he really means to you, in person.


Making this small effort to say these three sacred words can make a big difference in your relationship.
Don’t just say these words because you want something or because you’re making up after a fight; say them just because you truly feel them. That’s when it means the most.

, Making this effort to be affectionate when you start your day can lead you to feel more loving toward each other for the rest of the day. Though you may want to get started with your morning coffee and grooming routine, just spending a few minutes hugging, kissing, or cuddling your spouse can help you start the day off on the right foot. If you don’t see each other all day, then this affectionate gesture can make a lasting impression until you see each other again.


Taking the time to kiss your partner for just six seconds in the morning can spark the passion in your relationship. Don’t just give him a perfunctory “Bye, honey” kiss on the cheek; make sure you mean it, even if you’re in a rush.

, As your relationship progresses, you will find that there will be more and more obligations that will keep you from having time alone. However, you should make sure to get that time alone every week, even if you have to sacrifice some time with friends or family to make it happen. Remember that hanging out at your friend’s birthday party or at a barbecue at your parents’ house isn’t the same as just spending time alone together.If you feel like your schedules have been insanely busy and you haven’t had time alone together, then you should try to steal even a few minutes of your spouse’s time, whether you go for a quick walk together during a family outing or spend some time alone at a party.
As for your dates, make sure you plan those well ahead of schedule, so you and your spouse know to keep your schedules clear for those dates.

, Make sure to hug, touch, reassure, kiss, hold, or just be near your partner as much as you can. That physical connection can help keep your relationship strong and can make you feel close to each other, even if you’re not always on the same page. If you grow distant or cold and don’t even sit near your partner when you’re on the couch together, your relationship will grow distant, too.


Not everyone likes to be touched the same amount, especially not in public. Even if you’re not a big hugger, or a PDA person, make sure you give your partner reassuring touches at the right moment as much as you can.
It goes without saying that maintaining a healthy sex life can also help your relationship flourish. Be open and honest with your partner about exploring what you like and don't like.

, Whether it’s giving your partner a kiss on the hand, doing chores for him when he’s having a busy week, or leaving a sweet note on the mirror before you leave for work, you should never stop doing the little things, no matter how tired you are or how comfortable you feel in the relationship. You should never get lazy when it comes to your marriage and make sure to always make your partner feel special and loved.


If you’ve been too busy to do some of the usual things you do for your partner, try to make up for it when you have a bit more time. Let your partner know that you’re aware that you haven’t been as attentive as usual and that you want to make up for it.

, Make sure your partner knows how much you appreciate the little everyday things he does, like doing the washing up or making the bed. Don’t take those things for granted and tell your partner that you really do love and appreciate him and are grateful for all of the help he gives you. Of course, you can also respond by doing things that make your partner appreciate you in return.


You can even write your partner a love note thanking him for all of the things he’s done for you, from taking care of the dog while you’ve been sick to planning the most amazing birthday party ever for you.

, This will make the moment even more special. Gifts need not be extravagant or painfully expensive. It is always the thought that counts. A little something to create warmth and sweet memories can go a long way. Pay attention to your partner to hear what he’s been wanting and to get that unexpected gift for him at the right time.


Though special occasions, such as birthdays or anniversaries, can be a great time to give a gift, sometimes the most thoughtful gifts of all are given just because. Then your spouse won’t feel like you gave a gift just because you were obligated to do so.

, If your husband has had a busy week, then you should be understanding of that and spend more time cooking or doing work around the house. When you’re having a hectic time, he should do the same for you. Though you should find a balance of work that makes sense for both of you, if you care for your spouse, you should make an extra effort when he really needs you most.


Your spouse may even deny that he needs extra help, but if you can see that he is stressed out and overwhelmed, make the effort to cook, take care of the dog, or run some basic errands that week.

, You may think that you and your partner need to do absolutely everything together in order to live a happily married life. However, if you really want to maintain your bond, then you have to keep up some level of independence. If you and your partner do absolutely everything together and have no time to develop your own interests, then you are likely to become codependent and to lose a sense of your own identities.If you both spend time pursuing your own hobbies and interests, then you’ll continue and grow as people. You don’t want to be the exact same person you are now twenty years from now, do you?
Plus, if you and your spouse spend more time apart, then you’ll be able to appreciate the time you spend together more. It’s easier to take each other for granted when you’re always together.
You don’t have to bring your spouse along every time you hang out with your friends just because you’re married. Though you both should be integrated in each other’s social lives, it’s important to make time for “guy time” or “girl time” too, so you continue to build your friendships and your support network.

, If you want your marriage to last, then you have to keep making an effort to be romantic. While things will change after you’ve been with your spouse for a long time or when you have children together, you should still make an effort to make each other feel special, to have date nights, and to keep courting each other long after you’ve said your vows. This can help keep your marriage feeling exciting, sexy, and fun. Here are some things you can do:


Make sure to keep up with your date nights. Whether you have a date night every week or every other week, keep your dates with your spouse and make sure you don’t do the same old thing every time.
Find time for romance even when you’re at home. Whether you’re watching a romantic comedy or making dinner together with candles lit everywhere, it’s important to keep things feeling exciting even when you’re just at home from time to time.
Try writing each other really meaningful cards each year on your anniversary. Take the time to really write down all of the reasons why you love your spouse.
It can be romantic simply to keep your relationship feeling fresh and spontaneous. Going away on a last-minute weekend trip, signing up for a dance class on a whim, or opening that nice bottle of fancy wine you’ve been saving forever without planning for it can make your relationship feel very romantic and exciting.

, If you really want your relationship to last, then you have to learn to compromise and to make sacrifices for each other when it’s necessary. Your relationship won’t always be fun and easy, and there will be times when you need to sit down and have a serious conversation about what to do next. Whether you’re deciding where to live, when to have children, or making career decisions that affect you as a family, it’s important that you and your spouse have strong communication and know what your needs are before you make a decision.


Whether you’re making a big decision or a small one, you should make sure that both of you get to tell your sides of the story before a decision is made.
Listening is important. Let your spouse express his feelings without interrupting or disagreeing with him. Make sure you hear him out before you say what’s on your mind.
When it comes to compromising, it’s important to remember that it’s often better to be happy than to be right. Ask yourself whether you really want what you’re fighting for, or if you’re just being stubborn; that said, you want to make sure that you both make compromises for each other.

, As you and your spouse move forward in your relationship, it’s important that you can integrate your families and friends into your marriage and everyday lives. Though you don’t have to be the best of friends with each other’s families or to love every single one of each other’s friends, you should work to make it feel like your families are part of one big family, and like your friends are turning into mutual friends. This can help your marriage feel more secure and can make you both feel like you have a strong support network when you need it.


If you love your spouse, then you have to make an effort to love his family and his friends. If he has a particularly challenging family or group of friends, then do your best to understand where they are coming from and talk to your spouse about how you can build a stronger relationship with them without putting them down.

, If you want your marriage to last, then you have to be there when your spouse is going through a rough patch instead of waiting for it to blow over. Whether he’s dealing with a death in the family or doubting his career choices, it’s important that you’re supportive and understanding during this difficult time, knowing that your spouse will do the same for you when you’re having a hard time. You can’t expect your spouse to be in a good mood all the time, and you should make sure to be supportive when he needs you.


Of course, if you get into a pattern where one spouse is always supporting the other, that can get a bit frustrating and exhausting. If you feel like you’re always in the supportive role, talk about what your spouse can do to help you feel more like an individual.

, If you want to live a happy married life, then you have to understand that not every day will be a walk in the park. This doesn’t mean that you should expect marriage to be drab, dark, and disappointing, but it does mean that you should be prepared for the fact that there will be some struggles, some days of unhappiness, and some days when you just can’t even be in the same room as your spouse. It’s perfectly normal not to get along 100% of the time, and what’s most important is that you both know that and are willing to put in the work.


If you expect your marriage to be perfectly blissful every day, then you’re just setting yourself up for disappointment.
Remember that your spouse has flaws, just like you do. If you expect perfection, then you’ll only get sad or bitter. If your spouse has flaws you’d like him to work on, such as always being late, then have an honest, open conversation about it, and be willing to change the bad habits you can change, too.

, As the years go on, it’s likely that the person you’re married to won’t be exactly the same as the person you said “I do” to all those years ago. People change, gather knowledge and wisdom, and learn from their experiences as the years go on; they may even change their perspective on a number of things, from their thoughts on having children to their political affiliations. If you want to have a healthy marriage, then you have to accept that both you and your spouse will naturally change over the years; the important thing is that you grow together, not apart.


Be understanding of the ways in which your spouse is changing. If you feel that there are problems and he or she is turning into a person you don’t quite know anymore, then make sure you talk about it.
As you grow older, while it’s important to continue your own personal journey, it can also help you to develop interests together. Whether you like cooking together, following your favorite sports team, or watching the same shows year after year, it’s important to find a routine that can give you something to look forward to as a couple.
What matters most is that you and your spouse continue to love each other and be understanding of the fact that you will both go through ups and downs in your lives; if you’re true partners, then you’ll both grow into stronger, more capable, and more loving people.

If you have more area that you need to cover, or have lots of walls in your home, you’ll need a router that offers the option of upgrading antenna(s) with high gain types - if not supplied in the box. If more than one wireless device will be connecting at the same time at different speeds, a MiMo type router is recommended, otherwise the speed for all devices will drop the highest supported by all at that time.


All modern routers should support 802.11n, or Wireless-N). This is the most stable, offers the fastest speeds and is backwards compatible with older standards such as 802.11g.;
, Routers and wireless routers enable you to share your broadband internet connection with multiple devices. To do so, you will need to connect your broadband modem to the router. For best results, place your router near your modem.

Connect the router and the modem with an Ethernet cable. Most routers come packaged with a short Ethernet cable that you can use for this.
Connect the modem to the WAN / Internet Port on your router. It is usually offset, and may be a different color from the LAN Ports. WAN stands for ""Wide Area Network"" which is what the internet actually is. LAN stands for ""Local Area Network"". The router will assign a local or ""private"" IP address to any device connected to its LAN Ports or WiFi signal from a pool of private addresses (listed further below).

, If you have computers that are close, or a video game console or TV, you can connect them to the router via Ethernet. This will result in a more stable and faster connection, and doesn’t require any extra configuration., You will need at least one computer connecting via Ethernet cable in order to adjust your router settings. You can disconnect this computer afterwards if you want to connect wirelessly. You can also connect your laptop wirelessly for the first time, the wifi network name and the default password will be printed on the router's label, To connect the router to the internet, with some internet providers (i.e. GTPL in India), it is required to register router's MAC address to the internet service provider's website.,, Log in with the username and password provided by the internet service provider and go to MAC address update option. one can see their existing laptop / computers MAC address there. Add the router's MAC address there and save it. This process means that the router is authorized to use the internet provide by the broadband company., If this is a new installation or new router, determine the default IP address that may be printed on a label affixed to the router or in the documentation. If you can’t find the router’s IP address anywhere, you can do a web search for the router model to see what the default address is.


IP addresses are formatted as four groups of up to three digits, separated by periods.
Commonly found ""default"" Local IP addresses for routers are 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.1. Note that all the addresses in the follow ranges: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 & 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 have been set aside for exclusive use in a LAN; and one address in the range of any of them of them would be assigned to the connected router.

, Enter in the IP address of the router into the address bar and press Enter. Your browser will attempt to connect to the router’s configuration menu.


If your router came with an installation disc, you can run the configuration program from that instead. It will accomplish many of the same functions.

, In order to access the configuration page, you will need to be on the router's IP address and enter a valid username and password at the prompt. Most routers have a basic account set up that you will need to use to log on. This varies from model to model, but should be printed on the router or in the documentation.


The most typical username is “admin”.
The most typical passwords are “admin” and “password”.
Many routers will only require a username and a blank password, and some allow you to leave all fields blank.
If you can’t figure out the correct IP address, your username or password, search for your router model online to see what the default login is. If it has been changed, press the Reset button on the back of the router for 10 (to 30+ seconds as dictated in the instructions for the router model) to restore factory defaults and try again.

, When you log in to your router, you will be taken to the router’s main menu or status screen. There will be several options to choose from. The Internet section can usually be left at default settings, unless you received specific instructions from your internet service provider. The Wireless section will allow you to set up your wireless network.

, In the Wireless section, you should see a field labeled SSID or Name. Enter a unique name for your wireless network. This is what other devices will see when scanning for networks.


Check the box to enable SSID broadcast. This will essentially “turn on” the wireless network so that it may be readily seen by anyone in range of the signal. *See the Tips section below for additional information on the SSID setting.

, Choose from the list of available security options. For the best security, choose WPA2-PSK as the encryption method. This is the most difficult security to crack, and will give you the most protection from hackers and intruders.

, Once you’ve chosen your security method, enter in a passphrase for the network. This should be a difficult password, with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Don’t use any passwords that could be easily deduced from your network name or from knowing you.

, Once you are finished naming and securing your wireless network, click the Apply or Save button. The changes will be applied to your router, which may take a few moments. Once the router has finished resetting, your wireless network will be enabled.

, Once you have your network configured, you should change the username and password that you use to access your router. This will help protect your router from unauthorized changes. You can change these from the Administration section of the router configuration menu., If you want to prevent devices that are connected to your network from accessing certain websites, you can use built-in blocking tools to restrict access. These can be found in the Security/Block section of the router.


You can usually block by specific domain names, or by keywords.

, Scan for the wireless network with the SSID you provided above. On any device that supports wireless networks, you should see your new network as long as you are within range of the router. Select it and you will be prompted for the passphrase.

, Once you enter the passphrase, your device will be automatically connected to the wireless network. The network will be stored in your devices memory and will automatically connect whenever you are within range.


For detailed instructions on selecting and joining a wireless network for your specific computer, tablet, or smartphone, follow this guide.

, Besides other computers and tablets, you can connect other devices as well, such as printers, game consoles, TVs and more. See the following guides for instructions for your specific device.



Install a wireless printer.

Connect a PlayStation 3 to a wireless network.

Connect an Xbox 360 to a wireless network.

It is important if you do mix modalities to let your attendees know that they can have a choice to receive or refuse.,
Get the Word Out about Your Circle.,

Use Circles as Public Relations and Community Organization Training.,
Touch the World through Reiki Circles.,
Understand the Social Significance of Circles.,
Stay tuned.",How to Cultivate and Facilitate Reiki Circles," For those new to Reiki, a circle, or share, is a group of Reiki practitioners simultaneously practicing Reiki on a recipient for a set amount of time, usually fifteen to twenty minutes. The recipient then exchanges places with a practitioner until all in the group have received their treatment.


Strangers bond and healing is facilitated. It literally is magic in action. I also feel it’s one of the best ways to help facilitate world peace by breaking down boundaries in a safe manner and allowing individuals to help each other.;
, Everyone has a unique style. A favorite is where some sort of refreshment is offered, like tea and/or light snacks. The music sets the tone. Depending on the space, you might have candles or ambient lighting.


Above all, you create a safe space for the group healing exploration. Living rooms, furnished basements, community centers, and practitioners’ treatment spaces have all become circles. Years back we even had a rotating Reiki circle in each other’s living rooms. It’s a wonderful way of bringing extra light and healing into a space.
Experiment with live music (which is simply wonderful!), healing lights, healing pets (for those attending who don’t have allergies), incorporating other healing traditions like Shamanism, crystals, and aromatherapy.

, Clearing the space in between sessions is an important part of keeping the energy flowing and the space a sanctuary. Have both rose water and sage to smudge. Rose water is usually not as offensive an aroma as sage and can quickly be sprayed in and around the group.


Chimes, bells and ting-shaws (Tibetan cymbals used to mark the beginning/ending of a ritual) are sound instruments that also can be used at the end of each session, to mark the closing as well as to gently cleanse the space.

, Setting healthy boundaries for the circle creates optimum healing space.


The original author used to facilitate a sound healing Reiki circle, called Reiki Soundscape, with live musicians and instruments available for participants to use. At one circle, a practitioner came in and started banging mercilessly on the drum, shaking all of us up. Another practitioner began to do shamanic psychic surgery with loud cries that also disrupted the flow. Both instances encouraged the author to create a flyer with guidelines for practitioners in coming to an open circle. Loud, excessive noise was not a part of the circle, so it was stated in the guidelines and briefly gone over in the introduction each time.

,


Make little flyers and put them at the corner metaphysical bookstore.
Send a press release to the local paper and explain your healing intentions.
Multitudes of Reiki networking Web sites abound, and even craigslist allows you to post events for free.
The old paper flyer still has a place in letting others know about your circle, giving people something they can hold on to. Use both methods. Experiment, explore. Ask how your attendees found out about your circle. See what works for you.

, A simple mailing list is adequate for newcomers, but you will need to build a way to organize the information you receive. It is recommended that you use both an email and “snail mail” list so that, as your practice grows, you can send out messages of upcoming classes, circles, and other events you are offering. Some people prefer email, others a postcard. For those tech savvy, you might think about Facebook or Twitter contacts as well.


You never know what will come from inviting the general public to your circles, who you will meet, what networks you will create. From the two veterans who attended my circle years ago, our Reiki for Veterans program got its jump-start.
Encourage participants to bring their friends and family as well, an impromptu Reiki education for those who are curious. They might not participate in the circle, but they can certainly receive a session and sit off to the side and watch. During breaks, they will often ask questions or simply bask in the energy that is generated.

, Facilitating a Reiki circle is an excellent way for you, as a budding practitioner, to build your public relations skills as well. You must organize the event, market it, and then facilitate with grace and ease. Welcome to the world of self-promotion as a Reiki professional.


Each circle gets easier and easier, but in the beginning, you might feel overwhelmed. Shadow another facilitator for a while. Ask to co-facilitate and get a feel for the flow and for what details they have to keep track of. Take notes!
Reiki circles are grass-roots community organizing. But it’s important to keep a regular and posted schedule for your circles. People appreciate consistency and will more easily remember the dates of your sessions. Your reliability provides a foundation for you to present yourself as a professional business as well as to assist in the building of community. When you pull people together from such different spheres, you are building a healing community that can have a voice to share with the world.
For some circles, having practitioners pre-register and limiting the number might be a solution to holding a circle in a small space. For others, having them drop in is more appropriate and lends itself to a more casual and formal affair.
In holding a Reiki circle, you are building a tribe, so to speak. Become creative with ways in which you can reach out to this group and keep them informed of your offerings.
In the summer, you can have circles outdoors as well, and holding such a circle is a very magical and powerful experience. Not only are you channeling the healing vibration of Reiki, but you are also tapping into the soothing and grounding energy of the land upon which you are standing.

, Hold monthly circles for global healing. Instead of having clients lie on tables, take world events and places and peoples that were in crisis and put them in the center of your circle where you are seated and send healing energy from a distance. The impressions of each “send” were often quite profound. For every hour of news that you watch or read you should balance with sending healing.


A group out of Seattle, Global Earthsend, apparently has over fifty thousand Reiki practitioners connected worldwide via the Internet who send healing energy to a particular part of the world each Friday night. Again, powerful community involvement is working for world healing.
Before beginning your larger circle within the greater community, allow room for dialogue. Get to meet the other participants. What brings them to your space? Get to know the amazing people who share the same passion for healing that you do. We started the Reiki Fellowship that way, building upon many shared experiences in Reiki circles.

, Circles cost considerably less to the individual than private sessions. But the depth and breadth of where a client can go in an individual treatment certainly exceeds that of a fifteen-minute Reiki circle treatment. Yet, if you consider that most circles are donation based, and if one was to attend an event each week, the monthly cost would be ten times less than paying for private health insurance. Circles are not a substitute for traditional health care, but they certainly serve as a supplement for many.


The perception of “stranger” dies in such an environment. People come together to send healing energy to each other, to the world. Their individual differences are blurred into the healing collective. No one ego stands out. No one is greater than the other. Each person may have certain skills that differ, but together they form a healing unit that amplifies all those individual abilities and makes the unit function as a whole.
Circles are places of deep healing and self-discovery. They provide a safe environment of support and embrace and love reminiscent of being held by a universal mother. The circle becomes the receptacle for a recipient’s self-discovery and healing: “How do I feel about being held by those I had perceived as strangers? These people are now coming together to help me on my path. They have never met me, and yet they hold me.” Each one in turn receives from the group in an equal balance of giving and receiving. There are no expectations.
There are circles being held all over the world, in many different environments. As time goes on, we will see more of them in traditional arenas like hospitals, corporate spaces, and educational institutions because circles do offer an immediate experience of stress-reduction and relaxation.

, Keep doing your work. Hold a circle. Build your practice. Reiki circles as social healing phenomena are beginning to reach their potential. Continue to watch the world transform through the building of healing community and the sharing of Universal Energy.

Learn what art therapy means.,
Evaluate the advantages of this approach.,
Decide if art therapy is right for you.,
Work with a trained art therapist.,
Locate an art therapist.",How to Do Art Therapy1," Before you begin to do art therapy, it’s helpful to understand what exactly this process entails. In psychology, art therapy is a type of psychotherapy, a counseling technique, and a rehabilitation program where people make art to improve their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.The central idea behind art therapy is that expressing one’s self through art can be used to help people reduce stress, cope with trauma, resolve problems, and better understand their feelings and behaviors.;
, As you prepare to do art therapy, it’s important to consider some of the potential advantages of this approach:On a basic level, art therapy can help reduce your stress level, elevate your mood, and improve your overall mental health. This approach often teaches you about yourself and makes you aware of things that you may not have consciously acknowledged.
People who are not comfortable talking about themselves or participating in more traditional forms of counseling and therapy can use art to express their feelings and emotions. This is one of the features of art therapy that make it especially successful with children who might not have the vocabulary to articulate how they are feeling or are shy and withdrawn.
Another benefit of art therapy is that it can be done alone or in a group setting. Similarly, you can participate in art therapy on your own, or work with a trained art therapist who will teach you how to participate in art therapy, guide you through self analysis, and make sure you derive the most benefit for your specific needs.

, While anyone can benefit and you don't need to be a skilled artist, psychologists have found that art therapy can be especially beneficial to the following groups of people: Children who may not have the vocabulary to articulate how they are feeling or what they are thinking.
People who are shy and withdrawn, or who are uncomfortable talking with a therapist or counselor.
Individuals who have autism, dementia, cognitive disabilities, and traumatic brain injuries.
Victims of abuse, as well as people dealing with mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders.

, While you can perform art therapy exercises on your own, working with a trained art therapist can be helpful, especially at first. They will teach you how to participate in art therapy, guide you through self analysis of your work, and make sure you engage in exercises and therapy that meets your specific needs.If you have been diagnosed or believe you may have a mental illness, you will likely derive more benefit from working with a trained professional who can treat your condition and help you feel better as soon as possible.
Trained art therapists often have a master’s or doctorate degree in psychology, counseling, or art education. More colleges and universities are also developing degree programs focused specifically on art therapy.

, Art therapy is practiced in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, crisis centers, nursing homes, and private practices. If you would like to do art therapy and work with a trained art therapist, here are a few tips to help you locate one:


Look online at the American Art Therapy Association’s registry of credentialed art therapists. This registry is organized by state and city to make it easy to find a trained art therapist in your area.
If you have heard of an art therapist or mental health professional who uses art therapy, see if they have been credentialed by the Art Therapy Credentials Board, the main art therapy professional organization in the United States.Many therapists discuss their training and specialties on their websites or in online profiles. Review these to see if they mention experience with art therapy. You can also call the therapist’s office and ask if they employ this approach.

Just because a garment is labelled pre-shrunk, doesn’t mean it can’t be shrunk., Select the longest cycle available for the highest level of shrinkage. Careful not to abuse your clothing by damaging them in high heat dryers.


Dry cotton garments on high heat
Dry polyester or wool garments on medium heat.

, Since pre-washed, or pre-shrunk clothes usually stay true to size and form, you may need to get the garment altered or alter it yourself.


Alterations are preferable to shrinking when possible, especially if you wish to shorten the length of a garment without reducing its width. Remember that running delicate clothing through a washer and dryer may damage the quality of the fabric."

Even when one problem is solved, another one will come along to replace it sooner or later.
Finding ""the one"" doesn't mean finding a relationship without problems. Instead, it means finding a relationship you feel completely happy with even in spite of the problems.;
, Allow your partner see who you really are instead of playing along with a false façade. You need to be able to trust that your partner will accept the real you if you want the relationship to last.


Part of this requirement depends on your partner, as well. You should be with someone who loves the real you and never demands that you change for his or her own sake.
Similarly, you also need to love your partner for who he or she really is.

, A good sign that you've found “the one” is when you prioritize your partner's happiness even above your own. Everything has its limits, but in general, you should be able to spend time and energy on securing his or her happiness without kicking up a fuss about doing so.


Aside from simply wanting to make your partner happy, you should already have some idea of how to do it. Think about little things, like the foods and activities that can cheer your significant other up after a long day. Also think about big things, like being able to get your partner to open up about worries and dreams.
Like most things, your partner should be able to demonstrate the same interest in your happiness as you have for his or hers.

, Consider whether or not any of your priorities have shifted since you began your relationship. Selfish pursuits should seem less important than matters that affect your relationship.For example, consider your views on monogamy. If you previously had no interest in getting married and settling down but now hope to do so with your current partner, that partner must be special enough or important enough for you to have altered those beliefs so naturally.

, It's a good sign when you care enough about your partner to put a little extra effort into your appearance, yet still feel comfortable allowing him or her to see you with sweatpants and dirty hair.


Appearances have more to do with attraction than love, but when you really love your partner, you will naturally want to appear desirable in his or her eyes.

, Everyone argues with those they feel close to. The strongest relationships involve partners who argue, but do so with resolution in mind. If you don't argue at all, it's a bad sign. If even the simplest arguments turn into week-long drama-fests, it's also a bad sign.


When couples don't fight, it usually means that one or both people are not being entirely honest. When needs, desires, and difficulties are not voiced, they are not addressed, and the relationship remains weakened.
Healthy arguments are free of violence in all its forms: verbal and physical. The fights are fair, and no one tries to manipulate the other party.

, The two of you should be able to laugh with each other and at each other. There should be room for seriousness in a serious relationship, of course, but you also need to balance that out with a healthy dose of humor.


The teasing that goes on between you two should be gentle and playful, though. If one person routinely breaks into tears, you're doing something wrong.

, If the two of you need constant chatter and excitement to make your relationship work, it could be a sign that your relationship won't work, or it may just mean that your relationship is still too new to predict the future.


Enjoying the mundane means wanting to learn the little details about your partner's past and present life.
Enjoying the ordinary also means feeling content to sit in and spend a quiet evening together. It's natural to crave excitement from time to time, but you need to be able to enjoy your partner's presence during the dull times, as well.

, The two of you should connect in little ways and big ways. Look for shared interests and similar quirks. Also ask yourself if the two of you share similar priorities and goals.


If the two of you have different goals, your lives will naturally move in different directions. For example, if you want to settle down, marry, and have children, but your partner wants to explore the world and has no interest in raising kids, the things you want out of life may simply be too different to make things work.
Hobbies and everyday interests are less important than goals, but still worth paying attention to. Having one or two shared interests will make it easier for you to spend time together. The more unusual or obscure those interests are, the better.

, A strong relationship is built around respect and commitment. You need to be able to respect your partner, but you also need a partner who will respect you in equal amounts.


Respect leads to everything else a healthy relationship requires: commitment, trust, communication, and general satisfaction. Without respect, none of these other qualities can take root.

, Think about past conversations the two of you had concerning the future. When the topic comes up, both of you should feel comfortable discussing it, and both of you should be able to picture the other as a part of your own future.


Your talks about the future don't always need to be serious. If it's still early in your relationship, you might casually of the things you should do together ""next month"" or ""next year."" As your commitment grows, however, the two of you should be able to talk about your long-term future and the rest of your lives.

, Your significant other should be the one person you want to share everything with. “Everything” means just about everything—exciting news, fears, that great new coffee shop you found, and so on.


Ask yourself how often you stumble upon interesting things you want to share with your partner later on. The more often this happens, the more deeply rooted that person is in your mind. A deep connection signifies a deeper level of commitment.
More significantly, honesty needs to feel natural for both of you. If you find yourself keeping secrets or know that your partner routinely hides information from you, that's a bad sign., While a committed relationship definitely runs deeper than mere physical attraction, good chemistry is also important. Fireworks do not need to go off every time your eyes meet, but there should at least be an occasional spark.


Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy are closely related. You need both to balance out a romantic relationship.

, Both of you should have a greater interest in working through things together than working through them separately. You may need to put the welfare of the relationship above your own individual desires from time to time, and you both should be okay with doing so when the situation really calls for it.


The first ""we"" thoughts are usually positive. The mind shifts from ""what am I doing this weekend?"" to ""what are we doing this weekend?""
Eventually, though, your ""we"" thoughts need to shift to more serious matters. For instance, if you're offered a new job in a different location, you should be just as interested in how it will affect your future as a couple instead of only thinking of how it will affect your future as an individual., Ask yourself how much time you spend being together and how much time the two of you spend talking about how things or and how they should be. Being able to live in the “now” is important if you want to stay together in the future.


Of course, you need to be able to address issues and desires as they come up. If these problems preoccupy you too often, though, it's a signal that things don't flow naturally between the two of you.

, Ask your friends and family what they think about your relationship. Mind you, not everyone will see things clearly. As a whole, though, the people closest to you should be able to approve of your relationship. They have a more objective perspective than either you or your partner, so to some degree, they can see things for what they really are.


If someone you trust is urging you to get out of a relationship, you might want to take those pleas seriously.
On the other hand, you also need to consider the source of the complaints. Someone who loves drama or is otherwise possessive of you may not make the greatest judge. Someone who wants you to be happy and has never caused problems for the sake of causing problems can usually be trusted, though.

, You don't need to love all of your partner's friends or family members, nor do you need to spend time hanging out with his or her buddies. The people one chooses to be around is a reflection on the person as an individual, though. If you absolutely cannot tolerate the vast majority of your partner's social circle, you may need to reexamine your partner and figure out what those friends say about him or her.


For example, if you think that all of your partner's friends are troublemakers, you might want to ask yourself if your partner is really the little angel he or she seems to be in front of you.

, Both of you should want to spend as much time together as possible without completely falling apart when the other isn't there.


Spend a few days or weeks apart and gauge how it feels. If you're completely unable to function, that might be a bad sign. If you can function but eagerly await the day when you two can meet again, that's generally a good sign.
You should be able to have separate friends and interests, but if you feel happier pursuing these things than you feel when you're with your partner, your relationship is off to a bad start.

Instead, think of ""control"" as convincing other people to agree with your perspective. With the right methods, you can shift people's attitudes without losing their respect.;
, Make sure that the person you're influencing can actually achieve your aims. Setting yourself an impossible task can create a high-pressure situation, hurting everyone involved. Instead, aim to start a friendship, improve your work or chore routine, or solve an interpersonal problem.


Never attempt to force another person to love you, to snap out of an addiction or mental illness, or to make significant life changes against their will. The ""success"" of serious emotional manipulation is tense, fragile, and extremely damaging to yourself and the other people involved. If these are your goals, find a healthier approach instead.

, Right now, you're dissatisfied with how certain other people behave. But before you can begin to persuade them towards something different, you have to understand what’s motivating them to choose their current course of action. What makes them think that what they’re doing is a good idea? Once you know their current set of motivations, you can influence these motivations to persuade them towards something different.


Usually, the easiest way to find out their motivations is to simply ask: “Why do you think this is a good idea?” You can also try and figure it out by listening to what they say and watching what they do.
For example, your project partner is not contributing as much work as you'd like. He might be motivated by a sense of fairness (he already thinks he's doing enough), laziness (he wants to avoid the work), or low self-esteem (he doesn't think he can do the work as well as you).

, Now that you know what their current set of motivations are, try to understand the motivator that’s most important to them. Influencing this motivator will be the easiest way to get the most impact. Think about what they value most in making a decision, by thinking about decisions that you’ve seen them make in the past or arguments that you’ve had with them. If you know what’s most important to them, then you can introduce that motivator to get the result you want.


For example, you want your mom to vote a certain way in an election. She’s voting for the incumbent candidate because she knows her political stance better, and agrees with her social values. You know she values educational spending more than the social values platform, since she used to be a teacher. You can use facts about your candidate’s relationship with children, families, and education policy to motivate her to change her mind.

, Now that you understand what kind of things make an argument look good to them, you’ll want to take a look at the factors that hold them back from your argument. What about what you’re trying to do makes them think it’s a bad idea? When you know what they perceive as the risks with what you’re asking, you can figure out how to make those risks seem smaller.There’s no reason to be coy about finding out why someone doesn’t like an idea. Frequently, once someone says why they don’t like an idea out-loud, they’ll think that it sounds stupid or realize that they can’t explain themselves well, which can give you the perfect opening to talk them over to your side.

, One of the best ways to convince somebody to do something is to help them see themselves as the hero of the story.Humans look for their lives to have some kind of continuity. It’s what makes them feel like they can expect a happy ending. Shape other people's perception of their personal stories, showing them how much better they are when they’re part of your story. If you achieve this, you will be able to talk them into almost anything.


For example, let’s say that you want an investor to support your start-up company. Talk to them about how by supporting your company, they’re paving the way for innovation. They will be the hero that brings positive change to your community. They get to be the next Andrew Carnegie, leaving ripples of good work through history.

, Another way to make your ideas look more appealing is to get the person you’re trying to convince to feel like a part of the community, or to make them feel like they play a very specific role in the community. People have an incredibly strong need to belongand when you make them feel like they belong, they’ll be much more willing to go along with what you’re wanting them to do.


For example, let’s say that you want your sister to switch chores with you. Help her to see that by cleaning the kitchen, she'll be contributing to the house in a way that everyone will notice. Explain that you'd rather weed the garden for your own enjoyment, but that no one ever thanks people for those tasks.

, When you’re helpful to people and do things for them, they end up feeling indebted to you, making them more likely to think that they should do what you ask. Provide significant help (like helping them move, finding them a job and getting them hired, or setting them up on a good date) and they’ll be ready to help you in return when you ask.


An important part of this technique, though, is not letting them see an ulterior motive. They need to believe that you sincerely want to help them because you like them. It's up to you how true this needs to be; for your own comfort, you may want to avoid exploitative situations.

, Another way to make them feel like your path is the right path is to seem like you’re in control of the situation. If they think that you’ve got your hands on the steering wheel of life, then they don’t need to worry about surprise outcomes. This makes your way look like the safe way.


Seem in control by first of all being knowledgeable. Do your research. Know what it is you’re talking about. After that, project confidence as you discuss a solid plan that you have. Be ready for questions and have lots of counter arguments prepared.

, There’s that old saying that you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. While it’s not always true for flies, being kind to people and projecting positive feelings usually makes them more willing to listen to you, take you seriously, and agree with what you say. When you talk to people, don’t be judgmental, demeaning, rude, critical, or confrontational. Be firm and confident, but don’t be a jerk.


For example, avoid calling their views or choices “stupid” or explaining your views to them like they’re a child or mentally deficient.
Instead, build them up, be positive in your interactions, and do nice things for them. When they see you as a nice person who goes out of your way to help others, they’ll want you to succeed, they’ll want you to get your way, because it reinforces the idea that fate rewards good people. Their need for the world to be “fair” will necessitate that they do what you want.

, Some people are very emotionally prone. They experience strong emotions and then tend to think with how things make them feel. These are the kind of people that share lots of returning-soldier-reunited-with-dog videos on your Facebook wall. For these kinds of people, when you talk to them use language and arguments that play to their emotions in order to convince them. In the study of argumentation, this is called appealing to ""pathos.""


For example, make them feel sorry for you. If you’re trying to convince your mom to let you go to summer camp, say something like, “I just don't want to stay home all summer while my friends are away. I get so sad when there's no one around.""
People whose emotions are easily swayed tend to be vulnerable. Think carefully about the effect you'll have if you succeed. Are you comfortable causing regret or panic to get what you want, or will that spoil your victory?

, There are other people (and sometimes these two groups overlap), that like arguments that hold up to logic. They want evidence and good reasons to line up before they’ll be convinced. These are usually the people that post news stories refuting the latest Supreme Court decision with evidence of its negative effects. When talking to people like this, use logic in order to appeal to them. In the study of argumentation, this is called appealing to the “logos.”


For example, convince a boss to give you a sabbatical by listing the job-related skills you'll learn, and showing studies that breaks make employees more productive.

, With just about anyone, use language that makes them feel capable, confident, smart, knowledgeable, important, and kind. Using subtle, flattering language will make them like you more but it will also distract them. If they’re too busy thinking about how good they feel to get a compliment that they really like and weren’t expecting, then they won’t think about how your argument doesn’t make 100% sense to them.


For example, say something like “You know, I’d like to be the speaker for our presentation but I feel like I would just say everything wrong. Probably freeze up too. You’re just so much better at talking to people and making a convincing argument than I am. You’d probably have the whole group eating out of your hand.”

, Women have been saying for centuries that the best way to get a man to do something is to make him think it was his idea. However, this is basically true of anyone. If they think that not only is the idea probably good but that it was also their idea, then they’ll be much less resistant to doing that thing.


For example, say something like “My poor friend Dale is such a good guy. It’s a shame he never seems to catch a break. He’s got so much going for him too: he works so hard and he’s really smart. He’s even charming, really charming, once you get to know him.” if you want to try and get them to realize that they should hire/date/whatever Dale. They’ll hear this fantastic description and think, “You know, he doesn’t sound half bad. Maybe I should...”

, This shouldn’t be your first stop, but planting concern in someone's mind can be a very effective technique. Use language that plays to their worries, or that suggests the decision is time-sensitive.


For example, say something like, “You know, I heard they’re not going to be making these any more. If you want one, it’s probably better to buy it now, before you have to spend three times as much on eBay in order to get one.”
This kind of language and persuasion should be your last resort, because you usually only get to do this once. People quickly figure out that you’re just fear-mongering in order to get what you want, and then they won’t trust anything you say. This kind of reputation can spread as well, so be careful.

, It’s important for you to understand that feeling the need to control another person is not usually a healthy feeling. Just like you wouldn’t want someone to control you, it’s reasonable for other people not to want to be controlled too. Your need to control, however, is usually a symptom of a larger problem. Usually, it is because you don’t have control over another situation in your life. Since other aspects of your life feel out of control, you want to control another person so that you feel more secure. You need to understand that controlling another person won’t make your situation better and that finding another way to actually fix the problem will have a much better impact on your life.


For example, you might want to make some random girl you met fall in love with you. However, what you’re really worried about is that you feel like you’ll never meet someone who’s right for you, so you’re clinging to this girl who under normal circumstances you wouldn’t even like (or whom you at least have nothing in common with). A better way to deal with the situation would be to start looking in the right places, so that you find someone who really is your match. Even if you don’t end up finding someone right to date right off the bat, you’ll at least know that they’re out there.

, If you’re going to have a satisfying experience with life and feel good about most of the things that happen to you, you need to understand that many things in life will not go your way. As a wise man once wrote, “The world is not a wish granting factory.”If you know going in that you might not get your way, then you’ll be better prepared to deal with disappointment when it does happen. If you do get your way, though, it will be a pleasant surprise...meaning it’s a win either way.

, We can't control everything in our lives and we especially can't control other people. When you feel the need to control everything, it creates a lot of stress and negative feelings for you. It may even make you feel worse, in the long term, than if you had just let events play out in a natural way. Releasing your need to control will help you let go and enjoy life more.


Ask yourself: why do I need to control this situation? What happens if I'm not in control? You probably feel like things will go wrong if you don't control the situation. However, who's to say that what happens is what's wrong? Even a bad outcome may actually be a good outcome in disguise.
For example, maybe you want to control girl you like to make her go out with you. However, if you could make her go out with you, you may find out that she's actually mean, manipulative, or bad for you in some other way. Now you're stuck with her and the bad experiences that come from dating her! You don't want that.

, It's much healthier to let your life take the course it's going to take, rather than try to control every aspect of it. When you realize that things don't always need to go according to plan, you'll be much happier and feel more relaxed.


Start to embrace this concept by letting go of small things, like letting your waiter suggest something for you to eat when you go out to a restaurant.
You can also develop your ability to accept your situation by exposing yourself to more situations which are outside of your control, such as by traveling to an unfamiliar place.

, A lot of the time, we try to control other people because we feel like we don't have enough control in our own lives. Before you try to control other people, try to find areas in your own life where you can change how you act in order to gain more control over what happens to you. This is much healthier than the negative interactions that can often come from trying to control other people.


For example, maybe make yourself a schedule and work to stick to it, in order to create more time for you to get things done at work and do them well. This will work much better than trying to control your coworkers to make them do your tasks for you.

Freeze the herbs for ease of use when cooking.,
Select appropriate herbs for freezing.,
Wash and dry freshly picked herbs, as above.,
Some cooks prefer to freeze herbs in ice-cube trays, so that they have handy little sizes for cooking use.",How to Preserve Herbs3," Not all herbs will freeze well but for those that do, here is what to do.

, Usually this method works best for soft-leaf herbs such as basil, tarragon, lovage and parsley. Some herbs can only be frozen as they don't dry, such as chives.

, Strip the leaves off and place them into freezer bags or containers. Label and date them as they should keep for up to 3 months. If you want them to last longer, blanch them for a few seconds in hot water and then dip straight into ice-cold water and pop them into the freezer in bags/containers. Blanched herbs will freeze for up to 6 months.

, If you choose to do it this way, freeze approximately one-third chopped herbs to two-thirds water. Basil is great pureed with olive oil before freezing in ice cubes (don't add water). Remove herbs frozen as ice cubes and store in plastic freezer bags. Remove pieces as needed.

Make sure your entrance is accessible.,
Have a clear access path to the door.,
Make sure the entrance is well lit.,
Add decorative features on the walkway or near the entrance.,
Have a nice front door.,
At the front door, add features to make it look like a home.,
Make the front entrance a living space.",How to Make Your House Look Welcoming from the Outside," That means cleaning up the front yard, porch and entrance-way to allow visitors to get to the front door without stepping through or over obstacles. On the actual porch, clear away boxes, boots and shoes and anything else that doesn't belong there (these sorts of things can go at the back or family entrance).


Clean up the walk from the street, sidewalk, or driveway. Remove brush, thorny plants, overhanging branches, toys, or other hazards.
Make sure the walkway path itself is usable. Try to have cement, flagstones, gravel, or even a wooden walkway so people aren't stepping in water, snow or mud.;
, When visitors approach from the street, drive or other public area, can they see which way to walk? They must be able to open the gate, for example. An archway, trellis, or other landscape feature is a good way to announce the entrance.

, This means from the initial road entry through to the front door––anyone entering should be able to see their way clearly, both in dim light and dark night. To improve poor visibility, replace any broken or dim bulbs and clean and polish the light fixtures. You might even consider adding new light fixtures to improve both visibility and appearance.


Porch areas need at least 60- to 75-watt globes. Lower wattage will be too dim.
Garden lights can be used to line a pathway or steer visitors off your lawn and toward the entry.


, These could include potted plants, benches, paving stones, planter boxes, signs, statuary, bird baths, fountains, flowers, artwork, or decorative plants.


Even a simple straight path from the street can be made more interesting with cheap, used or free items. Visit yard sales or flea markets and see if you can find anything colorful that can sit in the outdoor weather and attract the eye.

, This could be as simple as giving it a good scrub and wash down. Or, if it has faded over the years, repaint it to a vibrant new color. Almost anyone can paint a door if they are willing to try! If the door is in really poor condition, it might be time to replace it completely, both for the sake of your sense of security and for improving the appearance of the front of your house.


Oil any squeaky hinges and polish up any metalwork on the door, such as brass numbers.
Don't forget the molding and framework around the door. If it's flaking, then it needs repainting too.
Check the floor beneath the door. If it is chipped, dowdy, dull, then clean it and polish. You might need to paint, varnish or redo the floor, depending on its make and style. Don't neglect this aspect, as it adds to the overall impression.

, You might have a small chair and table, a bowl of rocks or shells, a potted plant, a sign, a place for shoes or boots, an umbrella stand, hooks for hats or wet clothes, a brush for muddy shoes, a bin for walking sticks or canes, or some shade for hot days.


A decent, pretty doormat should be both functional and welcoming. Remove tatty doormats and either spruce them up or buy a new one. The doormat doesn't have to spell out welcome in letters (although some do), but it must make the visitor feel welcome.
Chairs or seats at the front door can become dull and discolored over time. If you have these, check that the condition of the wood or other material is good; if not, clean it up and redecorate it to look like new. And replace worn and faded cushions to make it all feel better again.

, If the front door is a place to sit and visit, to meet and greet visitors, to live in, it will definitely be more welcoming. Putting some chairs nearby in a conversational circle would be one way. Or just inside the door, make a space for visitors to transition into the house, with other chairs or benches to change clothes or shoes, to hang coats, set bags down, even to stop and admire a piece of art, a plant, or other decorative feature.


Don't allow obstacles at the front door. Don't make visitors step over a pile of shoes, the family dog, children's toys, or other things on the floor to get inside. This isn't welcoming.

Consider decorating the lid.,
Keep the occasion in mind.,
Glue colored ribbon around the sides of the lid.,
Add some embellishments to the ribbon.,
Consider layering paper cutouts if you are into scrapbooking.,
Glue down some scrapbooking embellishments onto the lid.,
Paint the lid with chalkboard paint, and write the person's name on the lid in chalk.,
Give the lid some texture.,
Keep kids and doodlers happy by taping some crayons to the lid of a blank box.",How to Decorate a Gift Box3," This section will give you a few ideas on how to decorate the lid of your box. You don't have to use all of these ideas. Instead, choose one or two that you like the best., Even if the rest of the box is plain, you can easily make it suitable for any occasion depending on what you put on top of it., Choose a ribbon that matches the height of your lid. Most list will be about an inch (2.54 centimeters) tall. You can also use rickrack or flat (non-ruffled) lace. Place some fabric glue around all four sides of the lid. Do not put any glue on top of the lid. Then, press the ribbon down onto the glue. Let the glue dry before doing anything else, such as placing a gift inside the box or tying a ribbon around the box.

If you want a layered look, glue a thinner ribbon right over the wider one. Just make sure that the thinner ribbon is centered over the wider ribbon.
Washi tape, scrapbook tape, or any other colored/patterned tape will work as well. Skip the glue, and just run the tape around all four sides of the lid.
This will also work great on round or hexagonal lids as well.

, After you have placed the gift inside the box and tied a ribbon, tuck some embellishments just behind the ribbon. Try to match the embellishments to the theme of the event. If necessary, secure the embellishment with hot glue or clear tape. For example, if the box is for a Christmas gift, you could do any of the following:

If the box has a blue or winter theme, loop a silver or white glittery snowflake around the ribbon.
If the box has a more rustic feel to it, snip a small branch off of your Christmas tree and tuck it behind the bow. You can also use a cinnamon stick instead.
If the box has a more traditional feel to it, you could tuck a small pine branch behind the bow, and add a tiny glass ornament; the ornament shouldn't be larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so in diameter.
For a sweet tooth, you might want to stick a candy cane behind the bow. If you want to add a more festive touch, look a jingle bell ornament over the top of the candy cane.

, You will need several pieces of patterned and plain cardstock. They should be of a similar shape, but in different sizes. Use small, double-sided foam tape to attach the largest piece to the center of the lid. Then, use the tape to attach a slightly smaller piece on top of the large one. Keep stacking pieces until you get the look you want. Try not to use too many, however. Three or four should be plenty.

You can complete the look by outlining the shapes with some glitter glue, and stamping pretty designs into the corner of the box.
Try to use ornate paper cutouts with scalloped edges.

, You can find them in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Find some colorful paper flowers, butterflies, and leaves in different sizes and glue them down in a small patch on the lid. Try to the largest shapes in the center of the patch, and the smaller designs on the sides. Give the patch an asymmetric shape to make it more interesting.

You don't need a lot of shapes to make this look beautiful, but you might want to use fewer large shapes and more of the smaller ones.
Consider working in odd numbers, instead of even. For example, you could have three large shapes, and five to seven smaller ones.

, This way, you won't have to mess around with labels. You can apply the paint on using a foam brush, or you can use chalkboard spray paint. Apply two to three coats, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next one. Let the paint to dry and cure according to the instructions on the can, then prime the chalkboard. You can do this by covering it allover with chalk, then wiping the chalk off., Find a large, paper doily that is the same width as your box lid. Glue the doily down onto the lid using some spray adhesive or Mod Podge. Let the glue dry, then wrap a pretty ribbon around your box., A blank box may be someone else's canvas. Take five or six crayons in basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), and tape them side by side in a neat row in the corner of the lid. Write the words ""Color Me"" next to the crayons.You can also cut down some coloring book pages so that the fit each side of the box, and glue them to the box. Tape the crayons to the top corner of the box. This will give your little artist something to color once the event is over.

If your hamster is dirty, never bathe it with water.,
Try to check when your holding your winter white that there is no infection in the eyes, tail, scent glands, or anywhere else around your hamster's body.",How to Care for Winter White Dwarf Hamsters5," If they look like they have overgrown, give them a chew stick or something to trim their teeth.

, The proper way to bathe a hamster is with certain types of sand, preferably children's play sand. (Never use dust) Leave a dish of it in the cage for your hamster to roll around in.

,


Never squeeze your hamster! This will cause stress and your hamster will most likely squeak, hiss, or bite. Always handle them gently!

Get regular exercise.,
Spend time in the sun.,
Get tested for osteoporosis.,
Learn your T-score and Z-score.",How to Eat to Slow Down Bone Loss in Menopause3," Performing regular weight-bearing exercise is a good way to build bone mass and prevent bone loss as well. Weight-bearing exercises include walking, dancing, jogging, and dancing. Non-weight bearing exercises include biking and swimming.Try going for a 30 minute walk most days of the week to get in some weigh-bearing exercise and help prevent bone loss.

, The best way to get your daily dose of vitamin D is to spend about 15–20 minutes in the sun without sunblock every day. Exposure to the sun allows your body to produce its own vitamin D. Since this may not always be possible, especially during the winter in some places, supplementing with vitamin D is still advised., One serious problem with osteoporosis is that it can be symptomless. Many women will not know that they have osteoporosis until after a bone fracture. That is why it is a good idea to have a bone mineral density (BMD) test if you are at risk of osteoporosis. This test is often called a DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and can help your healthcare professional to diagnose osteoporosis. Women over the age of 65 are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis, but other women under the age of 65 may be affected as well. Ask your doctor about getting a DEXA scan if you have:broken a bone from doing something that should not have caused a broken bone, like falling from a standing position
A chronic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or an eating disorder
Early onset menopause
Undergone hormone treatments, such as for prostate or breast cancer
Lost a noticeable amount of height
A history of smoking or currently smoke
Family members who have had osteoporosis
Been taking certain medications, such as corticosteroid or thyroid hormone replacement medications
A tendency to drink three or more alcoholic beverages most days

, The results of a DEXA scan are known as a “T-score” and a “ Z-score” though for most people, the T-score is most important. In both the T-scores and the Z-scores, a negative number indicates that your bones are thinner or more porous than they should be. A higher negative number means that you have a higher risk of a bone fracture.If your T-score is between 0 and -1.0, this is considered normal. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates that you have early osteoporosis, known as osteopenia. A T-score of less than -2.5 indicates osteoporosis."

See what you do to your hair everyday.,
The number one rule for healthy hair is in your diet.,
Moisturize your hair and/ or deep condition your hair at least once a week.,
Protect your hair Always use a heat protectant spray when you are heat styling your hair.,
Find a good shampoo and conditioner.

,
Trim your hair The longer you wait, the more you have to cut.,
Blast Off Switch to an ionic dryer.,
If you are a bleached platinum blonde you probably bleach your roots every month.,
If you want crazy colors in your hair get it professionally done.",How to Get Healthy Scene Hair," Do you tease and straighten it? Well if you are serious about having healthy hair then maybe cut some of it out. Learn to love your natural hair or keep your natural hair some days.;
, Lots of water and a diet rich in fruit, veg, fish and nuts will make your hair gleam. You won't get glossy tresses if you live on junk food. An unbalanced diet could lead to problems of hair like dryness, brittleness, dandruff and ultimately hair loss. Protein is necessary for strong healthy hair as hair is made up of keratin which is a protein. So, include for non-vegetarians - lean meat, fish egg and for vegetarians - paneer, yogurt, dals, peas, beans and nuts. Also eat salmon. Make sure you eat right by including the following in your diet:



Vitamin B - Green vegetables, beans, sunflower seeds, nuts and peas.

Vitamin C - Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, limes, melons and berries.

Vitamin E - Avocados, rice bran, nuts, dark green vegetables, legumes and whole grains.

Vitamin A - Carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, broccoli, cantaloupe and apricots.

Vitamin K - Seafood, dairy, figs, asparagus, broccoli, lettuce, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, dark green leafy vegetables, oatmeal, soybeans, wheat, yogurt, egg yolks and liver.

, To deep condition your hair, you just wash your hair and put some deep conditioner or leave in conditioner in your hair. Then put a shower cap on before you to go to sleep. There are deep conditioners that you don't need to sleep on, Like Aussie 3 minute miracle. But for better results wear to sleep. Leave some spray on conditioner when you go out or even when you're at home. Put some Jojoba oil or coconut oil in your hair at least twice a week.

, ALWAYS. Swimming pools can ruin hair. The chlorine in a pool is a strong bleach. It will discolor hair and leave it with an unattractive tinge. Protect your hair before going in by applying a deep conditioner. Immediately after, rinse your hair in apple cider vinegar, then with club soda. The carbonation will lift excess salt and chlorine out.

,, If you have scene hair, It's most likely going to be damaged. So there are going to be split ends. Also bleaching, and dying and teasing will cause split ends definitely. Trim them at least once a month.

, These require less heat, limiting hair damage, so your locks will be left looking shinier and healthier.

, Always make sure to NEVER GO OVER THE HAIR THAT IS ALREADY BLEACHED. It will cause breakage. Only bleach your dark roots., If you bleach your hair a crazy color it will probably turn out uneven which would make you bleach it more, which is of course damaging.

Look for signs of a stomach virus.,
Give your baby lots of fluids to keep him hydrated.,
Feed your baby to maintain adequate levels of nutrients in her body.,
Take your baby to the doctor if he is severely dehydrated.,
Administer medication to relieve stomach pain.,
Get medical attention if symptoms persist or resurface regularly.",How to Settle a Baby's Upset Stomach3," Check your baby's temperature to see if she has a fever or is experiencing diarrhea or vomiting — other signs of a viral infection. If you are unsure of whether or not your baby has a viral infection, consult with your pediatrician, who will determine if it is a virus and give you advice.Always seek medical attention if a baby under 3 months old has a fever of 100.4 °F or 38.0 °C.

, Maintaining your baby's hydration is crucial to help him recover from a viral infection. Vomiting and diarrhea can dehydrate your baby, and you need to combat this by allowing your baby to drink plenty of breastmilk or formula, or water if he is old enough.An oral electrolyte solution, like Pedialyte or Enfalyte, can be offered as well.

, If your baby is old enough for food, soup is an excellent way to replenish electrolytes and other nutrients that have been lost through diarrhea and vomit.


Feed the soup a little bit at a time, not all at once.
Try offering one teaspoon of soup every five minutes.

, If your baby is dehydrated, lethargic or very tired, and irritable, take him to the doctor to receive medical attention.You can identify severe dehydration if your baby has a dry mouth, dry and hot skin, a cold sweat, a sunken fontanel (soft spot), no tears when crying, and is not urinating enough. A baby should urinate at least three times in 24 hours or at least once in eight hours.
Your doctor will prescribe a means for rapid rehydration or will give him an infusion of fluids through an IV.
You may have to pick up a prescription rehydration solution at the pharmacy, before administering it at home.

, With the approval of your pediatrician, you can give your baby medication to relieve indigestion and stomach pain. Some medicines you can try are:


Mylicon or Tummy Calm drops. Drops such as Mylicon and Tummy Calm are sometimes effective in reducing gas trapped in the digestive system. You can also try a dose of children's acetaminophen if your baby seems to be in pain. Make sure to follow the directions in the product’s packaging, or consult your physician for the correct dosage., If the symptoms of stomach upset resurface regularly or persist despite your attempts at home remedy, you should seek medical attention for your baby. Watch out also for the following symptoms and call your doctor immediately if your baby shows signs of them:Presence of pus or blood in stool.
Black stool.
Persistently green stool.
Diarrhea and serious abdominal pain.
Swollen or hard belly.
Dry mouth, lack of tears, dark urine or decreased urine, or lethargy — these are all signs of dehydration.
Vomiting that persists for more than 12–24 hours, or diarrhea that persists for more than seven days or is very frequent.
Vomiting forcefully, or vomit that is green or has blood in it.
High fever. This, when combined with an upset stomach, could be a symptom of several things, which could range from food poisoning to an infection. It is best to bring your baby to a doctor immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment.
These symptoms could be indicating something more dangerous than trapped gas, such as food allergies, infection, intestinal blockage, or poisoning.
If you think your baby has swallowed something toxic, such as a drug, plant or chemical, and is showing symptoms of poisoning through vomiting and diarrhea, call your national emergency hotline immediately (at 1-800-222-1222 in the United States)."

Tattoos hurt.,
If you have a low tolerance for pain, or this is your first tattoo, choose a simple design, and place it in an area that has few nerve endings and will take ink well.,
However, if you are feeling daring, or would like a tattoo to evoke more of a ""rite of passage"" feeling, more sensitive (and often more sensual) areas are easily available.",How to Choose Tattoo Placement3," There's no way around it. The very premise of tattooing revolves around a mechanized needle (or set of needles....up to 16) being used to puncture the skin and thus open a channel in which an ink or dye is simultaneously deposited. There will be pain, swelling, heat, and blood, just like with any injury. But the level of pain can greatly vary from artist to artist, tattoo to tattoo, and person to person.

, Backs, shoulders, and upper arms are favored for this. They are not often touched on a daily basis, which will make your 5-10 day healing period easier, and they are easy to wash and apply ointment without too much torquing of the skin.

, The ribs are well known for being some of the most painful tattoos to endure, as the jarring of the tattoo needle invariably causes one to tense up (well developed or locked muscles are very painful to tattoo over). Also. because the skin over the ribs is very thin and the bones so close to the surface, people have reported a deep ache akin to cracked or bruised ribs being felt during the course of the tattoo. Any area with the bones close to the surface will have a similar type of pain: ankles, feet, knees, elbows, collarbones, hipbones, eyebrows, the spine. Other areas are sensitive due to collections of nerve endings: the hands, the insides of the arms, the breasts and nipples, anywhere near the face, the scalp, behind the knees, the arch of the foot, the palms and fingers, and the whole pelvic region, including the genital and anal areas. Think long and hard about whether you can sit through a session before choosing any of these areas! They can be very rewarding to have tattooed, but it's important you are able to be still and calm throughout the process of inking!

Help defend students that are being bullied.,
Plan activities to help end bullying.,
Find out what issues students care about.",How to Be a Good Class President3," If you see a student getting bullied or hurt, help them out. As a leader, it is your responsibility to help defend students that cannot defend themselves. There are several ways to handle difficult situations between students.Separate the students immediately and ask if everyone is ok. By calming everyone down and diffusing the situation, students will be able to relax and explain what exactly happened.
Ask a teacher or staff for assistance if the situation is too big to handle on your own. Sometimes having an adult present is the only way that students will behave, so asking for help should always come to mind in difficult situations.
Encourage students to report any injustices to you or to school officials. If someone tells you about a specific situation, let a school counselor know so they can approach the student professionally.

, Students should feel safe in school, and you can do a lot to make your school a better environment for everyone. You have to remember that this isn’t a job just for you, but with school faculty as well. Suggest to have hall monitors to supervise students between classes. Hall monitors can help make sure that everything is running smoothly while everyone is going to class. In case there is a problem, a hall monitor can address it or let an instructor know about the issue.
Help post anti-bullying posters around the school. By doing this, students will be aware of how they act and treat each other. Putting reminders for everyone will see can help reduce bullying.
Come up with workshops or seminars to help students speak up if they are being bullied.

, Knowing what kind of problems your classmates have at school is important, especially students that are shy or do not like to speak up. Many students do not want to openly admit they have problems. It is your job to try and identify these issues.


Let students know that you are available to talk with them whenever they need to.
Tell students your locker number so they can leave anonymous notes with the issues that bother them. You will still receive the messages you need to see, but students will be able to avoid the confrontation that they might not want to face.
Guide students who are actively voicing their issues to help others students voice their own problems as well.

Apply a cold compress.,
Eliminate irritants.,
Try a moisturizer.,
Avoid scratching.,
Treat the cause.",How to Stop Vaginal Itching1," No matter what the cause of your vaginal itching, you may be able to get temporary relief from the discomfort by applying a cool compress, like a washcloth, to your labia.To use a cold compress, take a clean washcloth and hold it under cold, running water until it is saturated. Then, wring out the excess water and apply the cloth to your vaginal area for about five to 10 minutes.
Make sure that you wash the washcloth after using. If you want to repeat the treatment, use a new washcloth.
You can also use an ice pack. Just make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a clean paper towel and do not leave it on your vaginal area for more than 20 minutes at a time.;
, Irritants from your laundry detergent, soap, or other products may be causing your vaginal itching.Switching to unscented laundry detergent and skipping fabric softener may help to relieve vaginal itching caused by allergies. You may also want to switch to a gentle cleanser to eliminate potential irritants from your shower gel.

For example, you could try using Dove bar soap or Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.
Avoid scented cleansers, wipes, powders, and other products that might irritate your vaginal area.

, You can purchase aqueous creams and emulsifying ointments that will help relieve feminine itch at most pharmacies. Be sure to follow all of the instructions for application, and be aware that these products will not treat the underlying cause of your itching., Scratching will likely only worsen the irritation and cause even more itching. It may even lead to an infection if you cause a lesion, so avoid scratching at all costs., Some women may experience occasional vaginal itching that does not require any kind of treatment, but if you have severe or persistent itching, there’s a good chance that there is some underlying cause. It’s important to identify the cause so you can treat it if you have an infection, or so you can avoid coming in contact with the source of the irritation."

Having a room with a whiteboard or chalkboard is also ideal.Study sessions should last between 2 and 3 hours, and should include a couple of breaks.

, This is one group member who is responsible to coordinate the meeting times and locations, keeping track of the time, and ensuring the group is following the overall plan (if one was created).A facilitator isn’t required, but is nice to have. However, it’s important for this person to know they are now “in charge” but are simply making sure things are organized and stay on track.

, These goals and objectives can be created for the study group as a whole, or for each study session. If created for each study session, these goals and objectives would include what chapters or topics are to be covered during that session, and how the group members should prepare for the session.Having clear goals and objectives helps make sure the study group stays focused on what they want to accomplish., Use your own words to teach someone else a scientific concept or equation. This will help you understand the topic more clearly, and will also allow your group members to provide feedback on anything that doesn’t make sense. Don’t just teach each other new or unknown items, but use this method to review any and all concepts you’ve already learned., Study groups aren’t just for studying, they’re also for providing each other moral support and encouragement. Make sure you congratulate each other on a job well done. Turn feedback into a positive statement. Come up with fun and exciting methods to learn new materials in your group sessions."

, Never be afraid to re-gift old gifts you've never used or opened. This can save you a lot of time and money, and you'll be getting rid of an unwanted item and up-cycling; just be sure to do it in the spirit of giving the item to someone you know will appreciate it. There is a lot of nonsense about re-gifting being unthoughtful––it is probably one of the more thoughtful approaches to giving precisely because you have to focus on whether or not it's an appropriate gift for the particular recipient.

Decide between the types of treats.,
Consider your dog's health.,
Check the country of origin.,
Check for recalled treats.",How to Choose Dog Treats1," Just like with treats for humans, there are a variety of treat types that you can buy for your dog. The kind you buy will depend on what your dog likes and the benefits of each type of treat. These treats include:


Dried kibble type treats, which are biscuit type treats that come in a variety of flavors.
Dental treats, which have ingredients and textures that help clean your dog's teeth and require more chewing
Jerky and chewy treats, which are typically made of pressed, dried strips of beef, chicken, or pork
Natural treats, which are made from all natural ingredients
Rawhide, which are dried strips of animal hides, typically beef, that have been pressed into various shapes
Bones, which are pieces of hard bone typically from cattle
Various other treats, such as pizzles, pigs ears, and dried vegetable leathers;
, You need to figure out if there are treats that are better for your dog depending on his health. Your dog may need special treats if he has certain chronic conditions such liver, kidney, or heart disease, food allergies, ingredient intolerances, or dental problems.


For example, there are treats with Glucosamine and Chondroitin specifically for dogs with arthritis, which come in jerky, rawhide, and chewy forms.0
If your dog has a chronic issue, ask your vet for treat recommendations.

, The United States regulates the ingredients in and making of dog treats. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) made it the law to make dog treats with only good, safe ingredients and must reflect what is listed on the labels. Look on the back of the treat bag to find the country of origin. If it is anywhere other than the US, look into the dog treat creating standards in that country before buying them.
China has been found to manufacture dog treats with ingredients that are not safe for dog, so never buy treats made in China., Even with regulations on treats, there may be recalls on treats. There is online database that you can check to make sure that the treats you buy your dog have not been recalled."

Choose a good reed.,
Have the best clarinet that you possibly can.,
Practice the open-throat tones.,
Make sure your embouchure is correct.,
Similarly, make sure you are filling the clarinet with air.,
Practice and play often.,
Keep working at it.,
Don't give up all your practice.",How to Get a Good Sound on the Clarinet," Most beginners start out on a 2 or a 2 1/2, but if you've been playing for a while and are moving into the higher register and/or altissimo notes, try a 3 or 3 1/2.;
, If you're still playing your 20-year-old hand-me-down Bundy, it's time for an upgrade -- go for a good plastic or wooden clarinet. Wood generally has a very nice tone quality, but plastic clarinets can sound good as well, and they're cheaper. If you already have a good clarinet, be sure to keep up with its maintenance. A COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting) once or twice a year is very important.

, The F, F#, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are the open throat tones for the clarinet. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very few (or no) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to travel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. Sit up straight, and, using the diaphragm, push air out playing the open G. Try to relax the throat so it's nice and open while not losing the embouchure. This takes years of practice and muscle training.

, Many players who are just starting or have never had correct instruction will make the mistake of ""smothering"" the reed with too much bottom lip, closing the throat to limit airflow, or any number of other mistakes. To form a correct embouchure, you should flatten your lower lip against your bottom teeth (as if you are putting on lipstick), which will flatten out your chin. Place the mouthpiece on your lower lip, rest your top teeth on it, and close up the ""gaps"" with your lips, in a drawstring fashion. This prevents you from putting too much pressure on the reed and should make it easier to produce a rich, full sound.

, While it is a small instrument, it does take some work to get the most sound and volume potential out of it. When breathing, fill up your lungs from the bottom up, and blow from your stomach, not your throat. Be sure to sit up straight and have correct posture while playing. If this is done correctly over a long period of time, you'll notice your lung capacity gradually increasing and you'll strengthen your abs. If you are having trouble feeling what this kind of breath support should feel like, try standing up with your feet together and putting your weight on your toes, to the point where you are almost leaning forward. Play something. Once you see how this should feel, you should be able to transfer the same breath support to playing while seated.

, Your tone quality will only get better the more you practice, and it really helps with the highest and lowest notes.

, Good tone quality doesn't happen overnight, and in the end, it all comes down to skill and dedication to the instrument

, It will definitely be worth it!

Purchase some battery-operated LED string lights.,
Find a suitable jar for the fairies.,
Attach the battery pack to the inside of the lid.,
Tuck the lights inside the jar.,
Consider adding some filler.,
Turn the lights on and place the lid on the jar.,
Decorate the jar.,
Enjoy the jar in a dark room.",How to Make Fairies in a Jar2," The best lights for this project are the miniature LED string lights with a small battery pack. They are often used to decorate miniature villages and houses. You can also use ordinary-sized LED string lights, but make sure that they are battery operated and that the wire is not too long. Look for something with a silver or white-colored cable. You are using LED lights because they do not produce as much heat as regular lights.


If you are planning on filling your jar with moss, then consider getting some lights with a green cable instead.

, You can use any sort of jar you want, but make sure that the battery pack to your lights can fit inside the mouth of the jar.


Consider using a tinted jar. You can also make your own tinted jar by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue and painting the jar with it.
For a softer effect, paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue. This will soften the glow of the jar, so that you will see the lights, but not the wire.

, Tape your battery pack to the bottom of the jar lid. The battery pack will go inside the jar, and won't be visible once you finish decorating it. Make sure that you can still reach the switch. You could try taping the battery pack, so it will be easier to take the pack out and change/charge the batteries.


If the battery pack does not fit inside the jar or the lid, purchase a canning mason jar with a two-part lid. Get rid of the flat disk portion of the lid and keep the ring. Tape the battery pack to the top of the lid, and cover it with a piece of fabric. You will wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the fabric after you put the lid on the jar to secure the fabric. The string of lights will go through the hole in the lid and into the jar., Spread them out so that they fill the entire jar.

, By adding some filler, such as white tulle, organza, or clear, iridescent cellophane, you can diffuse the light and make it appear softer. The filler will also help conceal the wires. Simply cut a piece of filler that is slightly larger than your jar and tuck it inside. You want the filler to be large enough so that it can be scrunched up loosely in the jar, but not so large that you have to stuff it in tightly.


You can also use some moss instead of tulle, organza, or cellophane. This will create a more forest-y effect.

, Flick the switch on the battery pack into the ""on"" position and place the lid on top of the jar. Screw the lid on tightly.

, You may still see a bit of the battery pack. You can conceal it by wrapping a ribbon around the neck of the jar and tying it in a bow. For more decorating ideas, refer to the section in this article on decorating your fairy jar.

, The lights will still be visible during daylight, but they will be even brighter and more effective in a completely dark room (especially if you made the jar look frosted).

Orient yourself in the survey illustration.,
Understand the property boundaries.,
Find important features.,
Note the scale and scope of the survey illustration.",How to Read a Property Survey2," The illustration should include a compass indicating which way is north. This is often located near the legend, or separately in a corner of the illustration. A good survey will distinguish between magnetic north and astronomical north. If the survey does not distinguish between the two, it's probably based on magnetic north, but you should check with your surveyor to be sure., Property boundaries are denoted with both bearing and distance. The bearing is a series of degrees, minutes, and seconds with compass point letters before and after each element. The distance indicates how far from a given point a boundary line extends.


The bearing represents the angle between north or south and east or west. You can measure this angle from a central point with a protractor. For instance, you might have a bearing of N 38° 03' 09"" E. If you measured an angle of 38° 03' 09"" from the north to the east on the survey illustration, you could then trace that northeasterly line to identify one of your property's boundaries.Degrees, minutes, and seconds are the units of measure for property survey bearings. For example, N 38° 03' 09"" E would translate as 38 degrees, 3 minutes, 9 seconds from the north to the east.
The boundary lines, or ""legs,"" are often denoted in feet and listed directly below or after the bearing.

, The illustration and accompanying written report should include the following, where present:


Physical and overlapping boundaries
Water structures such as a lake or stream
Shared fencing, driveways or sidewalks with a neighboring property
Roadways or driveways that are nearby
Existing property points of entry or egress
Buildings, repairs, modifications or structural improvements on the property
Locations of utilities, including water pipes and other plumbing, electrical, cable and/or telephone lines, gas lines, and utility poles , There should be a scale near the legend which indicates how distances are represented on the survey illustration. The scale will help you gauge distances on the property in question, including distances between it and nearby landmarks. For instance, one inch might correspond to one mile on the land survey illustration.The illustration might also orient the reader by providing a vicinity map -- also called a location map -- to indicate where the property lies in relation to the larger locality. The vicinity map is a small square inset usually located in a corner of the survey illustration.

Make sure the area has enough snow for you to use, as well., If you want your snowman to last as long as possible without melting, build it somewhere that doesn’t get much direct sunlight. If there’s a big shady tree near you, that’s a great spot. Making the snowman close to a building also provides shade for some of the day.


This is just to help the snowman last longer. If you don’t have much shade around, that’s okay.

, Make sure you are wearing warm, waterproof gloves, or your hands will start to hurt from handling the snow. Scoop up a handful of snow with both hands. Pack it together into a round shape. Add snow to the ball in your hands until it is about one foot (30.5 cm) in diameter, or until it gets too heavy.








, Set the snowball on the ground and begin rolling it forward. As you roll, avoid making a cylinder by changing the direction you’re rolling the ball. Keep rolling until the ball is about three feet (about 1 meter) wide.








Stop rolling the snowball in the spot where you want the snowman to be. Make sure you start somewhere near that spot, and roll the ball so that you end up there.
It often works well to roll the ball in a large spiral, but take note that this will leave an obvious pattern in the snow.
Pat your snowball together every so often to keep excess snow from falling off.

, Scoop up some snow in both hands and pack it into a tight ball. Add more snow until the ball is too heavy to carry. Put it on the ground and roll it around as you did for the bottom section. This time, stop when the ball reaches about two feet (.6 meters) wide.








Roll the snowball in a circle around the bottom section, or in a straight line away from it and back to it. This way when you finish the ball you won’t have to carry it a long way to the bottom section.

, Depending on how big you are, have someone help you lift the large ball. Bend your knees and be sure to stand up with your legs rather than your back. Pick it up and gently set it on the bottom section. Make sure that it sits right in the center of the bottom ball.








It helps if you flatten the top side of the bottom ball and flatten the bottom side of the middle ball. This helps the middle section sit firmly on the bottom section.

, Scoop up one last ball of snow for the head. Pack it with your hands until it is about one foot (30.5 cm) wide. You should be able to make the head without rolling it, but it’s okay to roll it if you want to. When you finish, carefully place it on top of the snowman’s body., Once the three sections are in place, scoop up more snow and pack it between each section. This will give the snowman a uniform look from top to bottom, rather than looking like three snowballs piled on top of each other.








, Grab a long raw carrot from the grocery store for the snowman’s nose. Place it in the middle of the top snowball. Make sure you place it so there is room above it for eyes and below it for a mouth.


Making the snowman your own is all about creativity. If you have something else that you think would look cool as a nose, use that instead.

, Place them above the carrot and space them evenly to the right and the left. Push them into the head, and twist them in a circle so that they stick in the snow. Any round object will work for the eyes.

Use yellow ping-pong balls, blue rubber bouncy balls, or large green plastic gems.

, Use the same thing you used for the eyes to make the mouth, or mix it up with other round objects. Place the mouth under the nose, but not too close to the middle section.

Cut a mouth out of felt, stick some fake plastic teeth in the face, or bend a piece of rubber tubing into a smile.

, Find a couple of sticks that are about one inch (2.5 cm) or less wide and around three feet (1 meter) long. Push the sticks into the middle section of the snowman. Position the sticks so they are angled up or down, giving the snowman the look you like best.









Before the arms, if you want, put a shirt or coat of some kind around the body of the snowman.
Also use old broom sticks, golf clubs, or fake skeleton arms!

, This is where you have even more space for creativity. Grab an old ball cap, cowboy hat, fedora, or top hat for the snowman’s head. Wrap a colorful scarf around its neck. Use old stuff that you don’t mind possibly ruining.

Add a tie, sunglasses, or any other accessories to make the snowman stand out from the rest.

Close all the doors.,
Plug up any gaps or exits.,
Warn everyone in the house that the hamster is missing.,
Look around your hamster’s cage and in his normal hiding spots.,
Listen for any scratching or chewing sounds in the room.,
Check for food and poop trails.,
Use a sunflower seed trail.,
Make a bucket trap.,
Leave the cage door open overnight.",How to Catch a Hamster," Before you can catch your hamster, you need to restrict his movements. Focus on closing all possible exits to outside, as it will be much harder to catch a hamster once he gets outside of the house.If you know which room your hamster escaped in, close all the doors leading out of that room.;
, Hamsters can climb stairs or wiggle into small gaps very quickly. Use towels to plug any gaps under doorways and the seal all the rooms in the home.You should also seal air vents or large cracks in the floorboards with tape to ensure your hamster cannot wiggle his way into these hiding places.
Be sure to look in the air vents or any cracks with a flashlight to ensure your hamster hasn’t already found his way in these spots before you seal them.

, Let others in the home know there is a hamster on the loose so they can help you close any doors or exits.If there are any other pets or young children in the room, take them out of the room so you can focus on finding the hamster.
If you are concerned that your pets might harm the hamster, such as your cat, keep the cat in a separate room or have someone hold the cat to contain him.

, Sometimes hamsters don’t stray further than the area around their cage and can be found easily. But your hamster may also have spots he tends to hide in when he goes missing. Usually these areas are narrow, dark, and easy to get in to. For example:Inside boxes, such as tissue boxes or empty garbage bins.
Under couches, beds, and loveseats.
Behind or under bookshelves.
Inside cabinets and wardrobes.
Inside kitchen and dresser drawers. Keep in mind when searching drawers not to push them back too hard in the event your hamster is hiding behind a drawer.
Behind large furniture like tables, vases, and mirrors that are on the ground.

, Most hamsters will chew through objects to get inside and burrow or hide. Your hamster can also squeeze into a hole as small as an inch in diameter, so she may try to chew or scratch through objects or even a crack in your walls. Turn off any sources of noise and then switch off the lights in the room. Sit still and listen for any scratching, chewing, or rustling noises. This may help you determine where your hamster is hiding., Sometimes, hamster who escape bring a hoard of sunflower seeds with them. Look for piles or trails of half-eaten sunflower seeds, or seed husks in any of your hamster’s usual hiding places. You may want to use a flashlight to check dark and narrow spots.Your hamster may also end up going to the bathroom when he is outside of his cage. Look for any droppings or poop trails, as this may lead you straight to your missing hamster.

, If you know which room your hamster escaped in and you have sealed off all possible exits and hiding places, you can try to bait your hamster with sunflower seeds.Set a trail of ten sunflower seeds leading into your hamster’s cage. Then, turn off all the lights in the room and sit quietly in one corner of the room.
Your hamster will be attracted to the seeds and should reveal himself to you. He may even walk straight back into his cage. However, it may be some time until he shows himself and you may have to wait awhile in the dark room.
You can also dust the floor around the seed bait with flour. Then when the hamster walks through the flour to get to the seeds, you will be able to see where he was headed.

, This is one of the most popular ways to catch a hamster. It is also a very simple trap that you can whip together using a tall bucket, a towel, several boxes or books, and a handful of treats.Flip over a tall, plastic bucket so the opening is facing upward. Place the towel in the bucket to cushion your hamster’s fall when he lands in the trap.
Put a handful of treats in the bucket as bait. It could be peanut butter on a cracker, a pile of sunflower seeds, or other treats that have a strong, enticing smell that your hamster will pick up on. You may also want to place a piece of lettuce or a water bottle on a stand in the bucket so your hamster has something to drink when he lands in the bucket.
Create a ladder leading up to the bucket. Use a stack of books, legos, or a set of small boxes to make stairs your hamster can climb up on to reach the bait, and the trap.
You can also place sunflower seeds or another treat on each step leading up the ladder to ensure your hamster makes it all the way to the top of the ladder and falls into the bucket.
Close the door to the room and check the bucket periodically to see if your hamster has fallen for the trap.

, Hamsters are nocturnal creatures, so your hamster will likely be more active at night. If you have spent the day searching for your missing hamster to no avail, try placing sunflower seeds in your hamster’s cage and leaving the cage door open overnight. Your hamster may come back into the cage on his own and end up burrowing in his cage.Check his cage in the morning to confirm he is back in his cage, safe and sound.

This agreement spells out the rights and responsibilities of the partners and contains provisions on how to resolve disagreements. Good partnership agreements contain dissolution strategies. Although the law does not require a partnership agreement, operating a partnership without an agreement can be highly risky. If there is a partnership agreement in place, locate that agreement as soon as possible., If you do have a partnership agreement in place, review the agreement for your rights and responsibilities and your options on how best to proceed. Sometimes partnership agreements provide details about dissolution procedures. In some cases, the partners may be required to take an official vote for the dissolution to become effective. Know the terms of your agreement regarding dissolution procedures., Once you have reviewed the provisions of the partnership agreement, consider whether dissolution is really necessary. Remember that you have other options as alternatives to dissolution.


You might consider changing the weighting of the partnership. This would allow one partner to acquire more decision-making or financial control through a majority share. The partner with the minority share can remain a partner while giving up some control to the other partner. Consider whether doing so would resolve your disagreement.You can also sell your share or buy your partner’s share. This would allow for the business to continue while allowing the partner who wishes not to be attached to the partnership anymore to remove her name from the partnership. Consult an attorney if you choose this option so that your interests are protected during the buying or selling process., Before initiating legal termination of the partnership, review your business as it currently stands. Consider, for example, how your existing contractual obligations will be affected by the dissolution. Are you locked into a contract? Will those contractual obligations continue regardless of your partnership status? Review your existing contracts, loan agreements, and leases to determine your partnership’s obligations to third parties and determine how dissolution will impact those liabilities., This is important because once the partnership is dissolved, each partner will typically assume business assets and liabilities based on a percentage of ownership. You can get a third-party to conduct a valuation of your business for you., Determine whether you and your partner(s) have completed all agreed upon duties.Doing so will minimize disagreements during the dissolution process and will minimize any legal issues that you might face during the dissolution. Importantly, after the dissolution agreement has been signed, the original partnership agreement becomes void. Therefore, make sure that all parties’ interests have been taken care of before the original agreement becomes void. Not doing so can result in one party suffering a loss because his rights under the original agreement are no longer enforceable., A well-drafted dissolution agreement can both dissolve the partnership and prevent future disagreements. A dissolution agreement can also maximize your legal defenses in case you are sued during the dissolution process., When drafting your dissolution agreement, identify the document as a “dissolution agreement.” Identify the partners and write the date on which the document will be signed., “Recitals” are those clauses that define the agreement and present important background information about the parties. In the recitals section, provide the following information:


A brief description of the purpose of the partnership;
The total amount of capital contributions that each partner made to the partnership. This includes both initial capital contribution and later contributions made specifically to the capital of the partnership (in other words, do not include loans or extensions of credit in the 'capital contributions' amount). Provide a separate entry for each partner with this information.
Mention the language of the partnership agreement that covers dissolutions. List the specific steps that your partnership agreement requires for dissolution to be completed. Summarize those steps and write them down. If your partnership agreement contains no information about dissolution, consult your state’s laws governing partnership dissolution., This information includes the name of the state in which the partnership was established, the name of the partnership, and the current principal address of the partnership., This information includes an explanation that each partner will assume assets and liabilities in proportion to their interests in the partnership. You can change the percentage of interests of each partner if you want to in the dissolution agreement., The “liquidating partner” is the partner (or partners if more than one) responsible for the administrative tasks of dissolution. Describe what those tasks are and what specific task each of the liquidating partners will be responsible for. E.g. which partner will be responsible for terminating leases, which partner will be responsible for filing the dissolution with the secretary of state office, etc., Decide which partner will be responsible for the partnership’s records after the dissolution. That partner will be designated as the “Custodian of Partnership Books.” This provision is optional and you may not wish to include it in your agreement or it may not be relevant to your situation., Your dissolution agreement should also contain a number of miscellaneous provisions designed to avoid legal liability. These provisions include:A provision for indemnification, which is a statement that the partners have agreed to divide the assets and the debts of the partnership on a pro rata basis. The purpose of this statement is to protect the partners in case one partner defaults. The defaulting partner in that case would be required to reimburse the other partners for the payments made to cover the default.A statement of release and discharge, which says that after the dissolution, partners cannot bring claims against other partners for partnership-related matters. This section should, however, provide for the possibility of bringing a lawsuit in case a dispute arises regarding the dissolution agreement.A statement that any changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by the partners., Your dissolution agreement should also contain statements about what law governs interpretation of the document, a statement excluding implied waiver, and rules on signatures.


A statement about governing law. This allows the parties to choose which state’s laws will govern the interpretation of the dissolution agreement. Note that this provision does not mean that a lawsuit can only be brought in that state; it only means that the chosen state's law shall govern interpretation of the document.A statement excluding an implied waiver. This means that you should write that even if one partner allows another partner to ignore his obligations under the dissolution agreement, the former partner does not waive his rights under the dissolution agreement.A statement on signatures. Write that even if partners sign the agreement in different locations or use electronic signatures, all of the separate pieces will be considered part of the dissolution agreement. Allowing for electronic signatures will make this process more efficient., Your dissolution document should also contain a statement on what happens if part of the document becomes void in the future, a statement on the role of section headings, and a statement that this agreement is the entire agreement.


A statement on severability. This means you should write that even if one part of the agreement is invalidated in the future, the entire agreement will not become void. Only the section that becomes void (e.g. because of a change in law) will be invalidated. The rest of the agreement will remain enforceable.A statement that section headings at the beginning of the section of the agreement are only meant to organize the document and are not operational parts of the dissolution agreement.A statement that the partners agree that the dissolution agreement they are signing is the entire agreement. Although such a statement may not prevent a partner from arguing that there are other enforceable obligations in other documents, such a statement may offer some protection against such claims., Sign the dissolution agreement in the presence of a notary public and in the presence of witnesses. Having your agreement notarized and signing it in the presence of witnesses will minimize challenges to the validity of a signature., Dissolution of a partnership requires filling out a Statement of Dissolution (sometimes known as a Certificate of Cancellation). Partnership dissolution is governed by state law, and you will need to visit your state’s official website of the Secretary of State to download a Statement of Dissolution form. A Statement of Dissolution form from the California Secretary of State’s website is available at http://bpd.cdn.sos.ca.gov/gp/forms/gp-4.pdf.
A Statement of Dissolution form from the Colorado Secretary of State’s website is available at http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/helpFiles/DISS_64_HELP.html.
A Certificate of Cancellation form for the dissolution of partnerships in New York is available at http://www.dos.ny.gov/forms/corporations/1390-f-l.pdf.
If your state is not one of the states listed above, visit your state’s secretary of state’s official website for further information.

, Once you have located the form relevant to your state for dissolving the partnership, fill out that form. The form is normally one or two pages and asks the following information:The name of the partnership as filed with the Secretary of State.
The file number issued to the partnership by the Secretary of State.
The form will contain a statement that the partnership is winding up its business and is legally dissolving. Do not alter this statement and know that signing the form means that you agree to this statement.Any additional relevant information that you wish to provide (including the possibility of attaching additional pages as necessary).
The name and mailing address of the person or firm to whom the filing will be returned after the process is complete.

, The liquidating partner responsible for filing the dissolution should do so as provided by the dissolution agreement. The agreement needs to be filed at the office of the Secretary of State in the state in which your partnership is registered.Depending on your state, you may be able to mail the form or be required to file it in person at the Secretary of State’s office., End your business's partnership permits, its licenses, and its fictitious business name registrations. Permits and licenses should be canceled with the agency that issued it. When you abandon a fictitious business name, you may also be required to notify your county clerk and publicize the termination in your local newspaper., It is important that you inform all of the partnership’s suppliers, customers, and clients about the dissolution because they may have an interest in knowing. Do not assume that publishing the information in a newspaper is enough. The liquidating partner responsible for publicizing the dissolution should send actual written notice to the parties., If you have employees, make sure all of your payroll tax deposits have been made and all of your tax paperwork is up to date. Inform local, state, and federal tax authorities about the dissolution. Sometimes tax returns have the option of marking a box that indicates that you have dissolved your partnership and will not be filing in the future., Dissolution of a partnership can have serious tax consequences, so seek help from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) about the tax consequences of your dissolution."

Pair slouch boots with a fitted dress.,
Make the look edgier with a flowing dress.,
Wear open-toe boots with a frock dress.",How to Wear Dresses with Boots2," Slouch boots are ankle boots that don’t fit tightly around the ankle. Pairing slouch boots with a short, fitted dress is a good way to keep the look laid-back. It is also a good way to make your legs appear slimmer.Wear black tights for an extra slimming look.

, This look is one exception to the guideline of pairing the boots with the style of dress. Wearing ankle boots with a flowing dress is a good way to add juxtaposition and a bit of edge to the style. Choosing motorcycle boots, however, may be too much of a juxtaposition., A frock dress is a dress that was popular in the 1950s and is typically looser fitting except around the waist.

Find a suitably humid environment to store the cigars.,
Leave the cigars inside the box with the lid open.,
Allow cigars to sit for up to a month.,
Rotate the cigars every 2-3 days.",How to Rehydrate Cigars1," Store the cigars somewhere with abundant natural moisture in the atmosphere. Damp or humid places like cellars and greenhouses make ideal environments for exposing dried out cigars to constant, steady levels of humidity.Be sure that the place you choose is room temperature, or only slightly warmer or cooler. Never leave cigars in places that receive direct sunlight or are near any kind of heat source.;
, Crack open or remove the lid of the cigar box and make sure the cigars are evenly distributed inside. Leaving the top of the box open will allow moisture to more easily infiltrate the box and penetrate through to the tobacco inside the cigars.


If the cigars aren’t completely dried out, leaving the lid propped open will be sufficient for allowing moisture to enter the box. For thoroughly desiccated cigars, leave the lid off.
A warm, damp towel can be folded and placed beneath the stored cigar box to provide an extra boost of moisture for especially dry cigars. Just be careful to change the towel out frequently, or it might mildew., Leave the cigars in the humid location for a couple weeks to a month. Make sure the cigars are situated where they won’t be knocked over, become wet or be exposed to direct heat or cold. This is the simplest method of rehydrating dry cigars, but also the slowest, as rehydration will occur at a very gradual rate.


Though it takes time, slow rehydration works best, as moisture is returned to the cigars little by little, which keeps the cigars from becoming overhydrated.Overhydration is essentially irreversible, and can result in deadening the cigar’s flavor, making it difficult to keep lit and even causing mold to grow on the tobacco.

, Check back on the progress of the cigars regularly. Rotate each cigar a quarter turn inside the box every few days; this will ensure that the entire outer edge of each cigar receives the same amount of moisture so that they hydrate evenly."

Choose your turkey wisely.",How to Keep Food Safe1," Don't buy cans that are leaking, bulging, or dented. Jars of food should not be cracked or have loose lids. Avoid buying jars where the button on the lid has already been popped up.;
,, Frozen foods should be frozen completely solid. They should be free of ice crystals and frost, as these are signs that the food may have thawed and then been refrozen.

, Chicken is easily contaminated if not stored properly. Be extra careful when picking out chicken to bring home.


Choose your chicken towards the end of your shopping trip. The longer it sits in your shopping cart, the more likely it will be to go bad.
Choose wrapped packages without tears, holes, or leaks. The package should be cold and feel firm when lightly squeezed.
Smell the chicken. If it smells spoiled, don't buy it.
Check the sell-by date. Remember that this is different than the use-by date; it's okay if it's today's date. Just plan to use the chicken within two days of its sell-by date to be safe.

, Like chicken, turkey is easily contaminated. Be sure to choose the turkey near the end of your shopping trip to avoid contamination while it's in your cart.


Find a wrapped turkey without holes, tears, or leaks. Be sure that the turkey is cold and feels firm when lightly squeezed.
Choose a turkey from the bottom of the stack. Often, those that have been stacked near the top do not stay cold enough to guarantee safe eating.

",How to Measure for Chair Cushions,"


Only measure chair cushions that still fit the chair frame well. If you measure misshapen cushions, the measurements for your new cushions will be off.;
,,


The cushion is most likely to be misshapen in the width, so take 3 separate width measurements. Take one from the top width, middle width and bottom width. Use the smallest of the numbers you obtain.

, Use this number only as a reference point, because it's likely the cushion has been flattened from use.

,,,,


Don't measure using the seam as your starting or ending point. Simply measure from one edge to the other.

,, Subtract enough from the measurement that your cushion will fit easily into the spot without too much room to slide or move.

Position the back light.,
Adjust the intensity of the back light to suit your subject.,
Use the sun as a back light in outdoor shots.",How to Use Three Point Lighting3," The back light's role is to provide a glowing rim of light around your subject that will separate it from the background. For this reason, the back light should generally be positioned directly behind your subject. The best way to keep the lamp out of your camera's shot is to suspend it above your subject and aim it downwards.

, If your subject is very light-colored (for instance, a fair-skinned person in white clothing), you will need very little intensity to your back light. A dark-colored subject will need a much more powerful back light to provide separation against the background, especially if the background is also dark.

, Just as you can use the sun as a key light, you can employ it as a back light. Position the shot so that the subject's back is to the sun. You can even use a bright aluminum reflector as a key light and a piece of white foam board as a fill light. This type of setup requires no electric light at all!

Deal with accusations.",How to Do Spiritual Warfare," As the term suggests, spiritual warfare occurs primarily in the spiritual realm. It may have repercussions in the physical realm, but if you don't address a problem at its spiritual root, you won't be able to combat it effectively.


In Ephesians 6:12, the Apostle Paul explains, ""For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.""This verse defines spiritual warfare as warfare against powers that are not “of the flesh,” meaning powers that are not physical or tangible in nature.
Since the spiritual and physical realms are connected, things that happen in the physical realm can have spiritual consequences and vice versa. Obedience to God in your earthly life, for instance, strengthens your spirit. Violating God's law in your earthly life will also weaken your spirit. As James 4:7 says, ""Submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."" You have to first submit to God in order to resist the devil.;
, Only by God's power can you hope to win against the enemy. Relying on God's power requires you to accept the salvation offered to you by Christ. You must also understand that each victory belongs to God.


When you rebuke the devil, you must do so in Jesus' name while relying on God's authority over evil. Even the archangel Michael says ""The Lord rebuke you"" when fighting with the devil over the body of Moses (Jude 9). If even angels must rely on the name of God to rebuke evil, it is little wonder that the Christian must rely on the name and power of Christ to do so.It is also important to understand that the name of Christ alone does not do the work. It is your relationship with Christ as a Christian that you must lean on.
Acts 19:13-16 describes the story of the seven sons of Sceva, who used the name of Jesus to drive out evil spirits without having a solid relationship with Christ. One day, an evil spirit fought back and overpowered them because they placed their faith in the wrong aspect of the process. They simply used the name of Jesus, but they did not really know Jesus.

, You have the power to do battle within the greater spiritual war, but this power is granted to you through Christ. If you begin taking pride in that power as though it were your own, you need to cast that pride aside before continuing. Satan might be able to use the sin of pride against you in spiritual warfare. To truly submit to God, you need to be humble. It is impossible to truly submit yourself to the might and will of another if some part of you believes that your own power can possibly be equal. If two powers are comparable or similar, then you hold neither one as absolute over the other.
You must fully rely on the power of God to do spiritual warfare. Let go of any pride you have concerning your own power. As the Bible says, ""Lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.""

, Doing spiritual warfare requires you to remain obedient to God in all things. Oftentimes, you must exercise great self-control in order to achieve such a level of obedience.


The Apostle Paul instructs believers to ""be strong in the Lord"" (Ephesians 6:10). It is important to note that the term is ""in,"" not ""by."" It is not enough to rely on God's power to win your spiritual battles for you. Instead, you must be in fellowship with Christ, fighting alongside God in the battles you face.To do this, obedience and self-control are necessary.
You must be obedient to God by following God's commands and by resisting or ridding yourself of any force that would influence you to do otherwise.
Self-control requires you to rid yourself of any excess. You need to balance yourself spiritually by resisting the urge to indulge in things that are wicked or in excessive amounts that can cause spiritual decay.

, 1 Peter 5:8 says, ""Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour."" Know that an attack may come when you least expect it. You must remain aware of the spiritual battleground, and you must also continually guard yourself against potential attacks.Treat the battle seriously. The enemy is always ready to attack, so you must always be ready to defend yourself.
When you wake up each morning, take the time to prepare yourself spiritually through prayer and meditation. Ask God for His help each day. A good prayer to pray is ""God I can't do this, but you can.""

, The ""armor of God"" refers to a set of metaphorical spiritual armor that Christians should wear at all times to protect themselves against Satan.


The whole armor of God is described in Ephesians, 6:10-18.
The passage instructs you to ""Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil"" (Ephesians 6:11). In essence, arming yourself with the protection and weapons offered to you by your faith in Christ, will allow you to stand strong and hold out against evil attacks of a spiritual nature.

, Ephesians 6:14 states, ""Stand, therefore, having girded your waist with truth.""


The opposite of the truth is a lie, and Satan is often referred to as the ""father of lies."" Arming yourself with the ""belt of truth"" means protecting yourself from the evils of deception by clinging to the truth. In the Bible, Jesus refuted Satan's temptations in the wilderness with truths from Scripture. You can also do this; quote Scripture to refute the lies of Satan.To cling to the truth, you must seek the truth in all things and speak the truth to all people, including yourself. Don't let yourself be deceived about anything.

, The second part of Ephesians 6:14 refers to the ""breastplate of righteousness.""


""Righteousness"" refers to the absolute righteousness of Christ, not the halfhearted and fallible righteousness of mankind.
Through your faith, you must rely on the righteousness of Christ to protect your heart against spiritual attacks just as a physical breastplate would protect your heart in a physical battle. If Satan tries to tell you that you aren't righteous, quote Romans 3:22, ""This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.""

, Ephesians 6:15 instructs believers to ""shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.""


The ""gospel of peace"" refers to the gospel or good news of salvation.
Preparing your feet with the gospel of peace suggests that you will need to take this gospel as you travel into enemy territory. By stepping forward with this gospel, your soul is protected with each step. As Scripture says, ""Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added unto you."" This includes spiritual protection from Satan.

, You are also instructed in Ephesians 6:16 that, above all, you should take ""the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.""


Faith is an absolute essential to have when engaging in spiritual warfare. Like a shield, faith can protect you against otherwise piercing attacks launched by the enemy. When Satan tries to tell you lies about God, remember to keep your faith that God is good, and that He has good plans for you etc.

, As Ephesians 6:17 states, ""take the helmet of salvation.""


The salvation spoken of in this passage refers to the spiritual salvation Christ offers through His death and resurrection.
A helmet of salvation can be interpreted as the knowledge of spiritual salvation. Just as a physical helmet protects the brain, the helmet of salvation protects the mind from spiritual attacks and false claims that would turn your mind away from God.

, The second half of Ephesians 6:18 instructs you to take ""the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.""


The sword of the Spirit is directly described in the passage as the Word of God, or the Bible.
To yield the sword of the Spirit, you need to have an understanding of the Bible. Your knowledge of scriptures can then be used as a rebuttal to spiritual attacks. Hebrews 4:12 says, ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.""

, The verses regarding the whole armor of God finish with Ephesians 6:18, which states that you should be ""praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.""


In choosing these words to wrap up the passage on the armor of God, the Apostle Paul highlights the importance of relying on God for spiritual strength through the practice of steady and ongoing prayer. The Bible tells us to ""pray without ceasing."" Continually pray over every situation in your life for God's protection and help.
The armor of God is a set of tools and protection that God grants believers, but it is the power of God that the believer must ultimately rely on.

, Offensive warfare requires you to actively tear down enemy strongholds previously built in your mind. Defensive warfare requires you to guard yourself against future attacks.An enemy stronghold is a lie that has already been built inside your mind. It gains strength by deception and accusation, and it may make it harder for you to resist the power of temptation or to see through Satan's lies.
These strongholds have a tendency to become stronger or louder when you are alone, so you need to actively work at tearing them down using the spiritual weapons God has granted you. As these strongholds lessen, it will also become easier to guard yourself against future attacks.

, The enemy uses deception to trick you into believing something untrue so that you will fall into error and sin.


A notable example of this would be when Satan deceived Eve into believing that no harm would come to her if she ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.
In reference to the armor of God, you actively rely upon the belt of truth and the sword of the Spirit when you battle against deception. The belt of truth is your defense against deception, while the sword of the Spirit allows you to fight against deception.
In simpler terms, fighting against deception requires you to understand truth. To understand truth, you need a thorough understanding of Scripture.

, When the enemy uses temptation, he tries to make something wicked look good and appealing in an effort to entice you towards it.


Temptation usually follows deception. For instance, Eve was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit after being deceived into thinking that doing so would be acceptable. Something wicked can only look desirable to you once you have been tricked into thinking that it is in some way good.
Dealing with temptation requires you to resist the devil while drawing closer to God. Both elements are necessary, and both naturally go hand-in-hand as you put them into practice.
Draw near to God through prayer, Bible study, obedience, and worship. As you draw closer to God, you will turn away from evil and temptation will have less power over you.

, The enemy will accuse the believer using past faults and sins in an effort to weigh that individual down with shame and hopelessness. The Bible refers to Satan as ""the accuser of the brethren"" so he will even try accusing you to yourself. Remind yourself always of the verse, ""There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.""


With regards to the armor of God, one of your best defenses against accusation is the shield of faith. When the enemy fires an attack against you using your past failures as ammunition, you must guard your entire self against the attack by relying on your faith in Christ.
You can also use the breastplate of Christ's righteousness to guard your heart and the helmet of salvation to guard your mind against such attacks.

Be inspired.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece10," The above ideas scratch the surface of what is possible by way of a centerpiece. The best things to keep in mind include:


Aim to keep it inexpensive. Reuse or upcycle whatever you already have around the home.
Try to use items from your own garden and cooking where possible, to give it an authentic feel.
Avoid overdoing the centerpiece. It's great to make it the talk of the table but not to have people banging their heads on it or knocking it over every time they go to eat or pass the salt!
Try to work in heirlooms. These are a way of connecting to the past and remembering people you care about who are no longer with you.

Does your friend only occasionally act clingy or is she constantly trying to claim your full attention? Figuring out how serious and recurring her need for your attention is can help you decide what the next step should be.Maybe your friend was recently stressed out and needs some extra attention. If this is the case, the problem should resolve itself.
You may need to try and set boundaries if your friend is constantly demanding your attention.;
, Using excuses may work, in the short-term. However, it can get tiring and it sets up a false kind of boundary. Whenever possible, try to not use one-time excuses to avoid hanging out with your friend. If you don't want to visit with her, you may have to be more direct. Being direct can help her understand your needs and boundaries more clearly as opposed to making excuses.Don't say something like “I've got a doctors appointment” to buy yourself some free time.
You will likely grow tired of coming up with excuses. Being direct can be more effective.

, If your friend is truly being over-bearing and clingy, there is nothing wrong with focusing on your needs. A good friendship should go both ways, being a kind of give-and-take that works to build a stronger bond. If your friend is taking more than she gives back, it's perfectly fine to let them know how you feel and what you need.Don't be afraid to tell your friend that you feel like she is asking too much of you.
A good friend will listen to you and give you the time and space that you need.
Your own well-being is important. Don't neglect your own needs for those of your friend.

, Thinking about your own needs over those of your friend may make you feel guilty or selfish. However, it's perfectly fine to consider thinking about the nature of your friendship and any problems it may have. Realizing that it's okay to think about what you need in a friendship can help you to avoid feelings of guilt.


It's important to remember that your own needs are just as important.
It can also help to remember that good friendships should make both people feel great and supported by the relationship.

, You may feel that your friendship can be saved. However, you may also realize that you don't feel like it can continue. Depending on how clingy your friend is being, you will need to make a choice to either work to fix the relationship or end it.


Think about steps you may have already taken to fix the relationship. Have you already spoken to your friend about your space needs? Have you tried other strategies to distance yourself? If so, what happened? Did it work for a while or not at all?
Consider how the friendship makes you feel. If it is draining and stressful to spend time with your friend, then it may be necessary to end it.
Ask yourself if seeing your friend only once per week or twice per month would be enough distance, or if you really do need to end the friendship completely.

, Your friend may feel that you are truly her only friend. If this is the case, it's easy to understand why she may want to spend so much time with you. Introducing your friend to some new people may help your friend to feel more connected to other people and start to branch out a bit more. This can be a good way for you both to enjoy the company of other people and still maintain your friendship.You can try hanging out together in larger groups to let your friend get to know other people.
Ask your other friends to try and spend time with your clingy friend.
If you tell your friend you are busy and can't hang out, suggest that they meet with other people who you both know.

, Don't feel pressured into meeting with your friend if you don't want to. Whenever you are making plans, make sure that it's a plan you think would be enjoyable and that you have time for. Always make sure that any time you are meeting with your friend that it will be good for both of you.


Don't feel pressured into meeting at a time or place that you don't want to. If you don’t want to meet up with your friend, then you might say something like, “That won’t work for me. Can we plan on a different day?”
You might also want to set some basic limits. For example, you might meet your friend once a month for a movie night. You might approach this limit by saying something like, “I like seeing movies with you, but I really only have the time and money to see a movie once per month. Let’s make the first Friday of the month our movie night.”

, If your friend is constantly calling or texting, you might need to tell her some specific days and times that are okay for her to contact you. You might be at work or busy during certain times or days and unable to speak with your friend, or you might just not want to see your friend on certain days of the week.


Try letting your friend know when you are free. For example, you might say, “I am really busy on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, so I might not be able to talk at all on those days. However, you can call me after 5pm on Tuesday or Thursday, or any time on Saturday.”

, In some cases, a friend may be clingy because of an issue that he or she cannot face alone. For example, it is possible that your friend might be clingy because of issues at home, a health problem, or something else that she does not want to face. Spending lots of time with you might be a way to distract herself from these issues.Try talking to your friend to see if you can determine if there is something going on that may be causing your friend to be so clingy. For example, you might say something like, “I have noticed that you are spending a lot more time with me. Is everything alright?”
If you friend confides in you that she is struggling with something, then you might encourage her to speak to a counselor. For example, you might say, “That sounds really difficult. I think it might be a good idea for you to talk to someone who can really help you.”

, If your friend doesn't respond to your lowered levels of attention or other statements that you would like some time apart, you may need to confront her. Try to meet in a place where you can have a clear conversation and let your friend know exactly how you are feeling and what you need from her.You don't have to be mean or aggressive. Instead, focus on being honest and direct with your friend.
You can talk with your friend about this in a friendly and understating tone. Try to state your feelings and needs while being empathetic to your friend.
Try to speak using “I” statements and explain how you feel rather than how you view your friend’s clingy behavior.
You might try saying something like “I really enjoy your company but I also need time to myself. I think we should see a little less of each other for a while.”

, To get some space for yourself, you may have to set up some clear boundaries first. By setting clear boundaries, you may upset your friend, but you will be respecting yourself in the process. To set boundaries, you will first need to identify your personal space needs.Think about how much time you need to yourself to be happy. How often does your friend interfere with this alone time?
Think about how you would like your friend’s behavior to change. What types of things would you like her to stop doing or to at least do less? Texting? Calling? Dropping by unannounced?

, Clearly setting boundaries might be necessary to let your friend know what you are comfortable with and what is not acceptable. This can help both of you express your feelings about the relationship and learn if it can continue. Be honest, kind, and understanding when setting your boundaries.If your friend invites herself along to events that you had already planned, then you might try saying “I love doing things with you, but I already made my plans for this night. Let's meet up another time.”
If your friend calls or texts you late at night or at other inconvenient times, then you will need to explain to your friend what you would like her to do instead. For example, you might say something like, “I love our conversations, but it is hard for me to give you my full attention when I am at work. Can you call me a little after I finish work instead, like at 5:30?”
If your friend gets upset or bombards you with more texts if you don’t respond right away, then you might say, “I enjoy getting a text from you but I can’t always respond right away. Can you try not to send me more than one text when you are waiting for a response?”
To get your friend to respect your privacy when you are at home or out doing something without her, you might say, “I look forward to seeing you, but it is not always convenient for you to drop by unannounced. Can you just send me a text or call me before you come over to see if I am free?”

, Having this conversation with your friend will likely be difficult. It may be tempting to give concessions or speak in a way that doesn't express your feelings or needs accurately. Always speak clearly and directly when telling your friend that you need more personal space.


Don't change your mind half-way through the conversation.
Avoid being unclear. Saying something like ""I love hanging out with you, but maybe, I don't know. Let's meet, once in a while? I mean, whenever, no big deal."" is unclear, not confident, and won't get your message across.

, Your friend may still try to enter into your personal space or go beyond the boundaries you've outlined. She may use guilt or other tactics to get you to change your mind, causing you to give in and give them attention. It's important that you stay strong and keep your rules in place.Giving in and breaking your own rules will send the message that your friend can still do whatever she wants.
Although it may be difficult, keeping your own rules in place is the only way to address this problem.

, If your friend continues to ignore your requests for time apart or doesn't like that you asked for it in the first place, you may need to end the relationship. Although it can be painful, ending a relationship with someone who ignores your own well-being can ultimately be the best move for both of you.Friends who won't give you space or time apart, especially after you talk with them about it, are unlikely to respect you.
Your friend may care more about her own needs than yours. This isn't how good friendships function.
Don't let feelings of guilt or a sense of owing your friend keep you in a bad friendship. If they aren't respecting your needs, it's okay to leave the relationship.

Find the right time to ask.,
Show gratitude.,
Provide a concrete reason.,
Give them time to decide.",How to Stay up on a School Night1," When you’re asking your parents to stay up on a school night, timing is everything. If you ask them when they’re in a bad mood or feeling particularly stressed, you’re likely going to get an automatic “no.” However, if you ask when they’re in a good mood, you have a better chance of getting permission to stay up.Pay attention to when your parents are usually in a good mood. For example, if your dad is always happy after he watches her favorite TV show, that’s a good time to ask him if you can stay up.
On the other hand, if you know your parents are upset about something, wait until later to talk to them. For example, if your mom tells you that she’s had a bad day at work, you should give her some time to relax before you ask about staying up.
Make sure that your parents have time to listen to your request too. Don’t ask them when they’re about to head out the door or working on an important project around the house.;
, Parents usually don’t respond well if you act like you entitled to something just because you asked for it. When you ask your parents to stay up on a school night, be sure to show gratitude so they know you appreciate all that they do allow you to do. Instead of just asking “Can I stay up late tonight?”, start by saying something like, “I know that you let me stay up sometimes for special occasions, and I really appreciate that.”Don’t just pretend that you’re grateful what your parents do for you. It’s important to genuinely appreciate what they allow you to do, so you don’t take for granted that they’re going to let you stay up whenever you want.
Avoid whining when you ask too. Be as polite and calm as you can manage.

, When you’re asking your parents to stay up on a school night, it helps to have a specific reason why you want to do it. They’re more likely to say yes if they know why it’s so important to you. For example, there might be a TV show that you really want to see or a late baseball game that you want to watch. Explain why you would like to stay up as clearly as possible, so your parents have good reason to allow it.Your reason for wanting to stay up late on a school night doesn’t have to be a one-time-only event. You might feel that because you’ve reached a certain age, it’s time that you be allowed to stay up late every night.
If you’re asking for a permanent change to your bedtime, you might say, “I really feel that because I’m 12 years old now, I should be able to stay up until 10 o’clock.”
It may also help to cite examples of friends who are allowed to stay up on a school night. For example, you might say, “Ryan’s parents decided to let him stay up late on Thursday to watch the playoff game,” or “Marissa and Katelyn are also 13, and they’re allowed to stay up until 10:30 on school nights.”

, You probably want to know right away if your parents are going to let you stay up, but try your best to be patient. If you put your parents on the spot and ask for an answer right way, they’re probably more likely to say “no.” Instead, tell that them that you want to give them time to think about your request.You might say, “Don’t say yes or no right away. Take some time to think about it before you let me know.”
Being patient can be difficult, so it’s a good idea to settle on a specific time when you’re going to get your answer. For example, you might say, “You don’t have to let me know right now. Let’s talk about it again tomorrow afternoon.”

Learn how to shave correctly.",How to Appear to Have Alexandria's Genesis," It is nearly impossible to have purple eyes (though certain lighting and makeup tricks can make blue eyes look more purple) so get contacts. This is easiest if you already have vision problems and need corrective lenses, but you can also order non-prescription contacts from specialty shops and online stores.;
, Most versions of the Alexandria's Genesis story do not say what color the hair should be but some say that dark (black or brown) hair is most common. If you want to, you can dye your hair a darker color. You should also take excellent care of it so it looks beautiful. Frizzy black hair that looks like it hasn't been brushed is a no no. Use good shampoo and conditioner, brush your hair with the right kind of comb or brush for your hair type, and maintain your hair to avoid the appearance of split ends.

, First, take very good care of your skin to reduce acne. Wash, exfoliate, and moisturize daily. Then you can use lemon juice or a mild bleach intended for use on the face to lighten your skin. You can also buy creams at a local drug store which are intended to lighten your skin.


You can also get some lotion or body spray with a little very fine glitter (or ""shimmer"") in it to give your skin the sparkle look described for those with Alexandria's Genesis.

, One of the ""symptoms"" of Alexandria's Genesis is that people who have it cannot become overweight. Eat healthy and exercise to keep your own weight down. A balanced diet (rich in vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and low in fats and sugar) can help a lot, plus it keeps you actually healthy and feeling great!

, Those with Alexandria's Genesis are supposed to be free of hair everywhere except for their head. Reduce the appearance of shaving by using a salt or sugar scrub before, after, and periodically in between shaving sessions. You can also wax if you prefer, although this is painful. Use lotions which heal the skin, like Bag Balm, to keep it healthy as shaving is very harsh on your skin.

, Try to make your menstrual cycle less noticeable by being discreet when you need to change a pad or tampon. You can also actually get rid of your menstrual cycle by getting a hormonal IUD or taking birth control pills and skipping the placebos.

, Being healthy in general strengthens your immune system. Get your shots and stay germ free so you don't ever get sick. Eat lots of fruit or take supplements to get your vitamin C, get vitamin D to help your body absorb the C, use zinc drops if you feel a cold coming on, and use hand sanitizer when you're out in public to avoid contracting illnesses.

, Stay healthy, safe, in shape, get checkups, treat illnesses, anything to make you live longer. Try to live past 100. If in the future they come up with a miracle pill that extends your life and is proven to work, take it!

, You can also lie about your age, making it seem as if you're much older than you really are. Learn about history and culture from the recent years past and talk about it as if you were there. You can listen to music, learn about fashion...even buy antiques which you can swear you bought new!

, Although you can't really not produce waste, just don't do it in public. Only in the privacy of your home may you fart, poop, or pee. Of course, if you really need to go, don't strain yourself. Just excuse yourself to ""touch up your lipstick"" or something else that requires a bathroom.

, Now, the legend explains that Alexandria's Genesis began with a light shining in the sky over Egypt a thousand years ago. In reality, Alexandria's Genesis was created when a young woman named Cameron Miquelon wrote a fanfiction (fan-written story for an existing media) for a 1990s MTV television show called ""Daria"".

, The symptoms include:


White skin that doesn't tan or burn
Purple eyes
Sometimes dark hair, but certainly no hair anywhere but the head
No menstruation but preserved fertility
Lifespans over 150 years and immunity from disease
No weight gain
No digestive waste

, Supposedly Alexandria's Genesis is a genetic mutation. However, the genes which affect these various parts of the body are not located in the same area. Only a number of mutations could result in so many symptoms, some of which are not even possible. Though it is possible to be fertile without menstruation (as some animals completely re-absorb their uterine lining instead), no lifetime over 150 years has ever been recorded and digestive waste would always be produced.


As for reports that people, such as Elizabeth Taylor, have been born with purple eyes, this is not true. There are many photographs and films that show Elizabeth's eyes to be blue. It is possible to have purple eyes in the case of incomplete albinism, but it is extremely rare.

, There are many ways to lighten your skin. You aren't limited to bleaching if you want to take a more natural, safe approach.

, Even if it is just to pretend to have this condition, getting in better shape is a great life choice. However, it's not totally intuitive. You can learn how to exercise properly to protect your body and achieve the results you want, however.

, Shaving is more complex than it seems. If you've never really shaved before, especially in really delicate areas, it may be a good idea to get some help.

Recognize the common causes of a broken femur.,
Understand that athletes are at an elevated risk of breaking the femur.,
Be aware that women are more prone to breaking bones.,
Know that preexisting medical conditions can heighten your risk of breaking your femur.,
Know that people of advanced age are at risk of femur breaks.,
Consider lifestyle factors that can affect your risk of breaking bones.,
Be aware that tumors or cysts can weaken bones.,
Know about the dangers of deconditioning.",How to Identify a Broken Femur2," There are some common causes of broken femurs that can be easily identified. Because the femur is such a strong bone, it usually requires significant impact or trauma to break it. Some of the most common ways to break your femur are:


Falls. Falling is the most common cause of a fracture, especially when you land badly. Toddlers who play outdoors, often slip and accidentally fall because of scattered toys.
Significant or massive trauma. This kind of trauma would be impossible to miss, and could include being hit in the leg with a hammer or a vehicular accident.
Sports injuries. Injuries, especially in contact sports such as hockey, can commonly cause broken femurs. This is especially the case in sports where a bat or hockey stick is used and accidentally hits the thigh.

, Individuals who participate in sports or are serious athletes are at high risk for a broken femur. Athletes who do certain activities like running, ballet dancing, basketball and other close contact sports like football and hockey are also prone to having broken femurs due to the high impact blows that the thigh bone receives.

, Women, especially those with an irregular menstrual cycle, are at an increased risk of breaking bones. During menstruation, a sufficient amount of iron is lost. Iron is needed in the proper development of bones.


Iron deficiency can predispose women to breaking bones.
Additionally, hormonal imbalances in women lead to bone weakening especially if estrogen (female sex hormone that regulates bone growth) is low.

, People with preexisting medical conditions, especially osteoporosis, are prone to breaking bones because they have weak and brittle bones.


Osteoporosis is a condition related to aging which causes the bones to become fragile and brittle because of hormonal and lack of absorption of calcium and vitamin D.

, People aged above 65 are at an increased risk of breaking their femur. This is because during aging, our bones weaken as the body absorbs less calcium, a mineral necessary for strong bones.


The body’s ability to metabolize important nutrients diminishes as a normal part of aging.

, People who drink more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week or smoke are at a higher risk of breaking bones. This is because substances in alcohol and cigarettes tend to reduce bone density.


Additionally, people with eating disorders have reduced amounts of calcium and vitamin D, nutrients that are necessary for strengthening the bones.

, As tumors or cysts grow, they can press against the surrounding tissues of the bone resulting in bone destruction and weakening. This can put you at increased risk of breaking your femur.


If you suspect that you may have some kind of tumor, get it checked out by the doctor immediately.

, Deconditioning causes decreased muscle mass and muscle weakness, especially due to lack of exercise. Physical activity causes formation of new bone tissue. If you stay inactive, then your bones will become brittle and fragile.

Check the fuel lines for visible defects.,
Check the fuel lines for invisible openings.,
Check the ignition system.,
Disconnect the gas.,
Check your fuel level.,
Clean the cooking grates.,
Clean the burner protectors.,
Clean out the burners and venturi tubes.,
Clean the cook box.,
Clean the exterior of your grill.",How to Clean an Outdoor Gas Grill2," If any fuel lines have unmistakable damage (like rips, holes, cracks), replace the parts immediately before your next use of the grill. Also be sure that any fuel lines have a smooth trail. You don’t want any of your fuel lines to be bent, because that will prevent the gas from flowing correctly. Check the exterior of the gas tank for any damage as well; things like dents, erosion, punctures, or any evident signs of damage. If you find areas that have obvious damage, you could potentially have a gas leak.If you are unsure or suspicious about the condition of your gas tank, have it inspected by a professional gas supplier. A professional gas supplier would have the authoritative knowledge to assess and address a possible gas leak.

, Create a mixture of soap and water. Make sure you stir the mixture around so it gets really sudsy. Then, use a paintbrush to brush the soapy mixture onto the fuel lines.Turn on the gas, and brush some more soapy water onto the gas lines. If any bubbles form on the gas lines, that indicates a gas leak. Immediately replace any fuel lines that exhibit signs of a gas leak.


This soapy water test should be done on a monthly basis, but also depending on how often you grill. The more you use your grill, the more frequently you should perform this test.

, Turn the gas off, and test your ignition button to see if it creates a spark. If both the pressure regulator on the gas tank and the ignition system are running normally (meaning the pressure regulator is tracking and maintaining correct gas tank pressure, and the ignition system is sparking and lighting correctly), you can finish testing the grill by turning the gas back on and lighting the grill up as you normally would.








If there is no spark, check the pressure regulator, and be sure it is secured tightly on the tank. Just like your stove at home, you can try to manually light the grill using a grill lighter. Just be sure to keep your arms and face away from the grilling area so you don’t burn yourself when the burners ignite.
If your grill is able to light in that manner, check the batteries in the ignition switch and wipe off the electrodes so there is no battery acid build up. The manual that came with your grill can show you how to properly deal with the batteries and electrodes., As a safety precaution, any time you clean your grill, disconnect the propane tank. That way, you will know for sure that any possibility of a gas related injury or fire is cut out of the equation.


Double check to make sure the gas is turned off at the tank before disconnecting it from the grill. You don’t want gas leaking out from the tank.

, If your fuel tank doesn’t have a gauge, you can check the fuel level by pouring some warm water onto the side of the tank. Slide your hand down the wet area of the tank (starting from the top), and note the temperature difference. The tank will feel cooler where the fuel level begins., Brush the cooking grates with a dry wire brush or a grill stone to keep food, grease, and bacteria from accumulating on the grates.After you have brush the top of the grilling grates, remove them from the grill and scrub the bottom of the grates as well.









Consider spraying a barbecue grill cleaner on the grates before you scrub them with the wire brush. After you scrub them clean, consider spraying vegetable oil on the grates to prevent rust.
If you’re using a grill stone to clean the grates, you don’t need to add any water before scrubbing the stone on the grates.

, Remove the burner protectors from the grill, and use soapy water and an old sponge to give them a good scrub down.The accumulated grease and grime should wash right off, leaving your burner protectors clean, and looking good as new.









Burner protectors are sometimes called flame tamers, heat tents, or vaporizer bars.
If you see a lot of rust or deep pitting (holes from erosion), it may be time to replace these grill parts. Any grill parts you might need can be found at your local home department store.

, The venturi tubes are the pipes that go out from the burners and connect to the grill control valves. These tubes allow the air and gas to mix together, altering the intensity of the flame.Remove the burners and venturi tubes, and place a hose head at one end of the tube.Turn the water on to clear out any debris or insects that could have gotten inside.









Insects often accumulate and nest in the venturi tubes during the grilling off season, usually around late summer and fall.
If your burners are not easily removable (or you’re not confident that you could properly replace your grill burners), use a sponge lightly moistened with water to wipe down the burners.
Failure to re-assemble your grill burners correctly could result in a fire hazard.
If the small holes in the burners are blocked and obstructed, use a small paperclip or pin to poke through the debris and clear the holes. However, if the holes are deteriorated and cracked, replace them with new burners., Remove the cooking grates and use a stainless steel cook brush to brush all the excess grease and debris from inside of the grill into the collecting bottom tray. Then, remove the bottom tray and throw out the collected grease and debris.Some of the debris will be loose and easily disposable, whereas other debris will be caked on. You might need to use a scouring pad or a sharp putty knife to remove the stuck on debris.









Consider washing out the bottom tray to keep things clean and keep grease buildup from accumulating. If you do decide to clean the bottom tray, just wash it out with soapy water, rinse and dry it, and then put it back into position under the burners.

, If you have a stainless steel grill, you can use a stainless steel cleaner to wipe down the outside surface with a paper towel, and keep your grill looking like new.If you have a porcelain grill, you can use a specialized porcelain grill cleaner.

Let the solution rest.,
Mix the solution before use.",How to Make a Longer Lasting Bubble Solution2," For this bubble mixture, you will need the following ingredients: Glycerin, liquid dish soap, and corn syrup.The glycerin, a natural moisturizer, will prevent the bubble from drying out—bubbles love moisture! The corn syrup will make the bubbles extra “sticky”.You can find glycerin at your local pharmacy.

, In a container combine 4 parts glycerin, 2 parts liquid dish soap, and 1 part corn syrup. For a large amount of solution, you could combine 4 cups glycerin, 2 cups liquid dish soap, and 1 cup corn syrup. For a smaller amount of solution, you could combine, 1 cup glycerin, ½ cup liquid dish soap, and ¼ cup corn syrup., If the solution does not work right away, don’t throw it away. Bubbles solutions improve with age. Leave the solution to rest in a sealed container for up to a full week.


These bubbles may bounce off hard surfaces.
When stored for a long period of time, the mixture may become moldy., While the solution was resting, the ingredients may have separated. Before you can use the solution, gently swirl the mixture with your hands or a spoon. Avoid shaking the mixture."

Identify the type of shaver.,
Examine the shaving mechanism.,
Prepare your skin.,
Keep the skin taut.,
Be patient.,
Maintain the electric razor.,
Try different products.",How to Shave Your Armpits2," Some newer models can be used with wet or dry skin, but the typical electric razor is designed only for dry use. Review the packaging to be certain which kind of razor you have.


If you are unsure, try dry shaving first.
Electric appliances should never be used in the shower or bath. Wet shavers can be used on wet skin, but should not be used while you bathe.

, If your razor has a rotary mechanism then it will be most effective if you move it in a circular motion. If it is a foil shaver then repeated back and forth strokes will provide the smoothest shave. Knowing in advance what type of motion to use will ensure a close shave and reduce the risk of cuts or abrasions.

, You will get the smoothest shave if the hair is completely dry. Clean your underarm hair to remove oils or  deodorant residue.Consider using a pre-shave product designed specifically for electric razors. These may be marketed to men to ease facial hair removal.

, Lift your arm in such a way that the skin underneath is as tight and smooth as possible. This will reduce the risk of skin becoming caught in the razor.


Hold the electric shaver at a right angle to your skin.
Shave against the grain of the hair. This may entail strokes in several different directions to ensure the closest shave., If you are just beginning to use an electric shaver your skin may be sensitive and irritated easily. After several weeks of consistent use this problem should self-resolve. If irritation persists, discontinue use or consult a dermatologist.


If you have open cuts or severely irritated skin, wait until you have healed completely before trying to shave again.

, Like most electrical products, shavers perform best when they are properly cared for. Replace worn out parts and clean the razor regularly.


Use a soft cleaning brush to gently remove hair and other particles from the blades after each shave.
Avoid tapping the razor against the sink or counter to remove hair as this may nick the blades or dull them.
Over time the razor may become dull, adding to the risk of cuts. The owner’s manual will likely contain information about how to order and install replacement parts.

, Most electric shavers are designed for men to use on facial hair, which may be too powerful for soft underarm skin. If you try a shaver marketed to men and have problems, consider searching for a product marketed to women instead."

Reveal your hands for ""the showdown."",
Rotate the button, shuffle the deck and play again.",How to Play Texas Hold'em1," One trusted player, or an outside party, should collect and count the money, or whatever you are wagering, and exchange it for poker chips for each player. If you are not playing for money, still the bank should divvy out an equal number of chips to each player. There are a couple ways to organize your game from here.


""No limit buy-in, winner takes all"". In this version, each player buys into the game with a set amount—perhaps $5 for a friendly game, hundreds or more for serious wagering. There is no limit on how many of their chips a player can bet at once—you can go ""all in""—but when a player runs out he or she is out of the game unless allowed to buy back in for another share of chips just as new players can buy-in during the first 2 or 3 days of the tournament with hundreds playing, coming and going. In these tournaments players are usually eliminated one by one by leaving it all on the table until the last remaining player wins the whole pot. But, in some large tournaments, the last 10, 20,30,... or 100 to go out get an increasing take-home, up to the ultimate winner's set pay amount (not the amount of the table pot).
""Limit, No Buy-in"". In these games betting at each stage of the hand is not allowed to go all in, and also players can usually buy more chips at any time. This means that instead of playing the original chips until eliminated, players can wager until they are no longer willing to put up more money. Often, a player can ""cash out"" of the game to take their winnings or cut the losses at any time.
;
, Sponsor can deal a card to each player to see who has high card to get to deal first. Give this person a token, called ""The Button,"" and a clean, standard deck of 52 playing cards (no joker, no wild card). The dealer shuffles the cards and always deals to his or her left, clockwise around the table to the button last. After each hand the button is passed to the left, and the job of dealing thus rotates around the table.

, Have every player prime the pot—a small amount of money for the table/pot before dealing any cards. Using an ante is optional, but it keeps the pot motivating for everyone to try and makes sure pot size doesn't depend only upon the money wagered.

, The player to the left of the dealer for each hand is the small blind and must first put in half the decided minimum bet. The next player to the left of the small blind is the big blind, who puts in the full minimum. These bets are called ""blinds"" because they are placed before any cards are seen/dealt.

, Hand them out one at a time, starting to the dealer's left and ending with the dealer/button. Players can look at their own cards and should keep them secure and facedown. These are the ""hole/hold"" or ""pocket"" cards, and each player hopes their pair combines best with the community cards. Players are responsible for keeping their hole cards secret. If a player's hole cards are accidentally exposed or are mucked/folded, that player forfeits claims to any money already paid into the pot for that round.

, If they had to put in the ante, then each player can ""check/tap"", until someone ""raises the ante"" which then must be at least called. The betting round begins in earnest with the player to the left of the big blind, called the ""action/under the gun"" position. Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player must call (meet) or raise (increase) the current stakes to stay in the hand. If a player chooses to bet or raise, the next player must meet (""call"") or raise that new bet, and so on. Raises must often be in increments of the minimum (big blind) bet. If a player does not wish to call or raise the current bet, he may fold by pushing his hold cards to the dealer into the muck/discards, quitting the pot and sitting out the rest of the hand. Betting goes around the table clockwise until every player has either folded or called or re-raised. If one player makes a bet none of the remaining players are willing to at least match, the hand ends and that player wins the pot without a showdown. He may muck his hand or choose to show either one or both of his hole cards (showing one or both cards when at least one is pretty good is a way of establishing or helping your reputation, ""see, I play when I have good cards, see this ?"").


When betting circles the table and returns to the small and big blind players, these players subtract the money they've already put in from the current call. Thus if no player had bet more than the minimum, the big blind has the ""option"" to either raise or stay in the game at no additional cost by checking. The small blind owes 1/2 of the minimum plus the amount needed to buy up to the call. If the minimum were $100, then the small blinds needs to pay in $50 to pay-in the minimum to the pot.

, These are community cards that players still in the betting hope will combine favorably with their pocket cards.


Before dealing out the flop, or any subsequent cards, the dealer should discard, or ""burn,"" the top card of the deck face down to lessen the ease of the dealer slipping a card on top for cheating purposes.

, The flop is followed by a second round of betting, this time without counting any players as the ""blinds"". Just bet normally starting with the player to the button's/dealer's left. Players are betting on the total of the two cards they have face down in front of them and the three community cards face up in front of the dealer.


If no one has yet bet, players may ""check"" to pass without betting for now. If no one bets the game moves on, but if a bet is made as action goes around the table, then those that checked must bet/call the new stakes to stay in the hand.

, The turn is the fourth community card dealt already turned face up by the dealer. Now players evaluate their chances based on their best five-card combination of their two secret/hidden hole cards with some or all these four community cards—with the knowledge that there is yet one more community card to see that might improve their hand. But, players without a significant draw/combination at this point should probably check/fold unless they hope to bluff their opponent(s) to fold/rather than to bet more into the pot. The bet amount may make it too expensive to ""pay to see"" the possible bluffer's hole cards. Then no one else knows whether it was a bluff or not, unless the winner chooses to show one card as a tease or downer, or to even show he or she ""had real goods"", if it was not purely a bluff.

, Since the river is the last card, players bet based on the best five-card hand in these seven total cards—this hand will not improve, so check/fold now it you don't believe it is going to win, unless you hope to bluff your opponents out of the pot. Again, if one player makes a bet the remaining players aren't willing to match, he or she wins without having to reveal his cards.

, Assuming there are at least two players who haven't folded by the end of the last round of betting, the remaining players flip over their two pocket cards, starting with the last player to bet and going clockwise. A player who tried to bluff, got called, and knows he is beat may simply muck his hand and forfeit the pot. Each player announces his five card hand. The player with the highest hand wins the pot (the total sum of all chips bet on this hand).

, Hold'em poker usually continues until most of the players have been knocked out or quit and either a single winner has all the chips or the remaining players choose to split the pot proportional to how much each has won.

Some may feel scared and sad, while others could feel anger and denial. Know that there aren’t any right or wrong feelings.


Children may not know how to react and will often take cues from their parents about how to respond. Know that your children may be looking to you before they know what to feel. Although it may be difficult, try not to respond in a way you wouldn’t want your children to.For example, if you want to send the message that it’s okay to cry, then don’t try to hide your tears or grief from everyone. However, you may also want to enforce the idea that your children should remain hopeful by considering treatments and adopting a healthy lifestyle.;
, Hearing the news of a cancer diagnosis is overwhelming and frightening. Although everyone handles it in different ways, holding it in typically makes things worse. Talk to your family about how you feel about the news, whether you are the person with cancer or it is someone else in the family. Not only will getting your feelings out in the open likely make you feel better, but you can find out how everyone else is feeling, which gets the family on the same page.


Consider the personalities of everyone in your family to find out how to get them to open up. Some work better in one-on-one settings, while others are more responsive in group settings.You might start by simply saying, “Well, we had some big news this week. How are you feeling about it?”

, The age of your children will guide your discussions about cancer. You can consult with a doctor, nurse, or mental health provider on how to share the news with your kids. In general, it's best not to tell them everything at once, but a little at a time. Try to get a thorough understanding of the diagnosis and prognosis before sharing so that you can address any of their concerns.You might say, ""Daddy has a sickness in his lung called cancer. This happens when abnormal cells grow fast and spread. Daddy will need to visit the doctor and take special medicines to help him get better.""
It may also help to read children's books that depict a story of someone being very sick in order to give your child a contextual reference from which to process the news.

, When you do talk to your children about cancer, you can expect a variety of reactions. Encourage them to ask questions. And try to address their fears. Understand that some kids may act out as a way of demonstrating their sadness or confusion, while others might act ""numb"" or like they don't care at all. Generally, such behavior will stop after the child comes to grips with the news.


However, some kids may have trouble coping with the fact that a family member is sick.Get professional help from a counselor or therapist if your child is having trouble coping.

, Your family likely has lots of questions about your diagnosis. Getting the answers straight from the doctor can give them the support they need. Having them involved in your diagnosis and treatment plan may help them feel more optimistic about the future and can bring you closer together., If the diagnosis is terminal or end-stage cancer, the process of coping will also be a process of saying goodbye. Both adults and children will have varying ways of coping with the impending death of an ill family member. Grief specialists identify several stages that families go through during this time. Here's what you can expect.Crisis: This period may be marked by anxiety, guilt, or anger. Meeting with a therapist or support group is practical during this time to process the emotions surrounding the news.

Unity: Everyone comes together to define their roles and focus on the needs of the ill family member. You might decide on medical services or make legal and burial arrangements.

Upheaval: Unity fades if the dying process goes on for an extended period. Everyone's lifestyle endures major shifts. Negative emotions may reemerge. Family relationships may become strained.

Resolution: Family members begin to reflect on memories with the person and their place in the family. Unresolved issues resurface and may need to be addressed. If seized appropriately and facilitated by a grief counselor, families can use this time to heal old wounds and make peace with the past.

Renewal: After the person dies, the final stage of grief begins with a memorial and celebration of life. Family members may feel both sadness and relief that their loved one is no longer suffering.

, Sometimes loved ones disagree on cancer treatment options. Whether you are two parents with conflicting goals for a child's treatment, or several siblings at odds over a parent's treatment, discord will only make the process harder.If possible, it's always best to consider the desires of the ill person to some extent.


Present the options like ""Mom, you can go through chemotherapy or you can sign up for a clinical trial with this new drug. What do you want to do?"" Giving the person a voice can help them feel empowered, and take the burden of choosing from your own shoulders.
However you choose, everyone needs to be on board to participate in treatment so that there is some degree of harmony in the decision. Changing diets for the whole family or moving across the country to get better access to specialized treatment requires everyone's participation. Have a family session with a mental health provider who has experience with end-of-life care to help facilitate a discussion with your loved ones.

, Depending on who in the family has been diagnosed with cancer, you will likely witness role reversals within the family unit. The primary caretaker of the family may now become the person who needs the most help. The children in the family may also need to increase their workload when it comes to household responsibilities. Having a family member with cancer is an adjustment, but it is doable.


The relationship between the spouses may also change. Intimacy may become a problem, and marriages can become strained. Consider attending a therapy session to speak with a counselor if you are having troubles in your relationship after learning of a cancer diagnosis., Not focusing on the fear and enormity of the situation may be difficult, but it is in everyone’s best interest to stay positive. Chances are, the person with cancer is already worried and frightened about what lies ahead, and concentrating on the “doom and gloom” aspect of the sickness isn’t helping. Putting on a brave face can inspire others in your family to do the same, and can make living with the situation much more bearable.When the person is having a “good” day, plan family outings or a game night. Try to maintain as much normality and usual family time as you can.

, Feeling sadness is normal after the initial diagnosis, but keep an eye on your family members for signs of depression during this difficult time. The person with cancer isn’t the only one who can suffer from depression; those around them can, as well. Depression is a serious matter that could have long-lasting or even tragic consequences, if it isn’t addressed.


Signs of depression include an overwhelming feeling of sadness that lasts for weeks and doesn’t seem to get any better, causes problems with day-to-day activities, and has the person feeling hopeless or worthless., Sometimes, the best thing to do after a cancer diagnosis is to keep things as routine as possible. Continue going to work and exercising, if you are able. Allow your children to participate in the same activities as they have before. Adjusting to cancer is already difficult, and completely changing the normal way of life may be too much to handle.Maintaining a sense of normalcy can help everyone hold it together during this confusing and upsetting time. Having a set routine provides structure which can be helpful when the unpredictable can happen with your loved one’s sickness.

, Providing care for someone else is often very taxing. The most important thing that caregivers can do is to take care of themselves. In the case of families, it’s important to look out for and care for each other.


Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities you enjoy. Feeling good yourself can help improve your mental health and allow you to better care for others., Those with cancer and those who are supporting them can go to support groups to talk to others about what they are experiencing. Although you want to cope with the diagnosis as a family, sometimes, you just can’t talk to your family about everything. Patients may not want their families to hear all of their concerns, and the families may not want the patients to hear their fears. Support groups are safe places in which all matters can be discussed without fear.


Ask your doctor about support groups in your area, or contact your local hospital for information. Online support groups are also available if you can’t leave the home, or if you can’t find any in your area., When your friends offer to cut the grass for you or carpool the children around, let them. Accepting help may hurt your pride initially, but you’ll likely find that it’s extremely helpful in the long run. Also, don’t feel like you are putting your family and friends out by asking for help—they are probably more than happy to contribute to your family.If you need help but don’t have anyone who is offering, look online for handyman services or someone who will provide assistance in whatever you need help with. Sometimes, spending a little money is worth the help.

, Cancer is likely new territory for you and your family, especially your children. They may take this news harder than anyone, and you might not feel like you know what to do for them. Taking your child to a therapist may be what they need to really talk about how they feel, and learn how to adjust to this major change."

You can also check to see if it needs more time by looking at the texture of the hot dog; if the skin looks wrinkled and darker in color, it's probably done.
If you're cooking more than a few hot dogs, they will need an extra minute or two to fully heat.

, Use a fork to remove them from the hot water and drain the dogs on a paper towel before serving.

Heating and cooking gases such as propane and natural gas contain a noxious scent, in order to indicate a possible leak. This is a potentially dangerous situation. If this is a possibility:


Have all people exit the living quarters immediately.
Open windows and doors to ventilate.
Check for any obvious sources, such as a gas burner that is not but is not lit.
If possible, turn off propane or natural gas sources.
Call the gas company, your landlord, or repairman as soon as feasible.
Sewer gasses can smell similar, although not identical to natural gas. This may happen due to an issue with a toilet or other plumbing issues.;
, More typically, bad odors arise from simply not cleaning. Regular cleaning tends to keep these at low or undetectable levels. Clean, spotless houses usually smell pretty good, too -- although even good housekeepers can end up with unfortunate, smelly situations.

, Air fresheners are a ""band-aid"" rather than a cure for bad odors. However, that may still be desirable. This is best for temporary situations, such as someone leaving bad odors in your bathroom after using the toilet.


Covering up a stink with an air freshener may not eliminate the stink. You could end up with the smell of flowers and ripe dirty socks, which may not really be an improvement!
If possible, choose an odor neutralizing air freshener like Febreze rather than one that only perfumes the air.
Air fresheners (such as Lysol) that kill bacteria do not actually clean the air. They still essentially act as a cover-up odor.
Asthmatics and those with chemical sensitivities often react very strongly to air fresheners.
Natural air fresheners can help freshen without resorting to harsh chemicals. Try a bouquet of fragrant flowers, some essential oils, or a simmering pot of cinnamon sticks and orange peels on the stove.

, Rotting food is a huge source of nasty smells. These may arise from:


Refrigerator: spoiled food will cause bad odors.
Counter tops: especially if food or beverages are left out.
Sinks: If dirty dishes are left out, they tend to smell over time. Also, if in-sink disposals are not tended to, they tend to get bad smells.

, If your house smells like garbage, chances are good that it is your kitchen trashcan. Ideally, take out the garbage every day. In hot and humid weather, garbage will start to smell bad quicker than in cool and dry conditions.


You may have to clean or replace your garbage can. Over time, the receptacle may get rather filthy and smell as bad as the stuff in the bag.
Garbage bags have been developed with odor reducing material, and even scents. While these can be helpful, they do not eliminate odor.

, Pets are often a large source of odors. They do not tend to be distressed by their own odors--often the opposite!--but humans will usually readily pick up on animal odors. These sources tend to be:


Feces & urine: Whether from a young puppy or elderly dog, clean up any messes. Any messes on carpets or upholstery may call for a deep cleaning. Litter boxes should be cleaned daily, no matter how good the kitty litter.
Cages: Caged animals, such as hamsters, mice, or birds require regular cleaning. Just cleaning the litter may not be enough; the cage may need sanitizing weekly to cut down on animal smells.
Tanks: Fish, frogs, and other aquatic creatures require very clean environments. If your tank has a distinct odor, your filtration system or cleaning regimen may not be up to snuff. Also, consider the ventilation in your house. The humidity from your aquarium, for example, may be causing a mildew problem in your basement apartment.
Furry animals need grooming. Regular brushing, trimming, washing, and otherwise tending to your animal's cleanliness will help your home smell less like animals.
Vacuum carpet surfaces regularly. Your pet may not like the vacuum, but regularly cleaning carpets clean up fur, dander, and other pet odors. Using baking soda or carpet powders in moderation can also help.
Neuter your pet. Animals who do not experience heat cycles or elevated hormone levels also tend to smell less strongly.

, Fabrics tend to hold onto odors more than hard surfaces. Therefore, if your house is smelling bad, an easy step is to clean the washable fabrics in your house. A small scoop of baking soda in the detergent may be a good idea. Fabrics to be washed include:


Clothing: piles of unwashed socks, underwear, workout clothes, and so forth will smell especially bad. Athletic gear in particular needs to be washed promptly.
Bedding: Sheets, blankets, pillowcases and so forth will start to take on body odors after a while. You may well not notice them, but it is there.
Curtains: Smoke and mildew odors tend to linger in curtains.
Towels: Wet towels that are not dried promptly will start to reek in a few days. Wet towels should always be hung up to dry. Do not leave wet towels on the floor, or even worse, a bed. If a towel needs laundering, and it will not be done within a day or so, it should be dried and NOT put in a laundry basket.
Shoes: These are in the category of fabric, even though they are often made of leather or other non-fabric material. Whatever they are made of, shoes are often a major cause of stinky odors. Wash your shoes, if possible. Use odor-controlling insoles, powders, or devices. If your shoes become wet, be sure they dry completely...not left in your gym bag!

, Carpets and rugs are usually fabric, although most cannot be simply thrown in the washing machine.


Clean up messes promptly, with a carpet spot cleaner. If your puppy messes on the carpet, or you stepsister spills her juice on the carpet, do not let it sit there for any length of time.
Vacuum regularly. Vacuums clean up particles that lead to bad smells.
Use baking soda and vacuum powders with caution. These do an excellent job reducing odors. However, they work because they leave a portion behind. In time, your carpet may become filled with a white ""dandruff"" that while it smells good, is actually filthy.
Shampoo your carpets. Once or twice a year, or as necessary, shampoo your carpets. In many areas stores offer reasonable rates on rental units, if you do not want to buy your own. A deep cleaning of carpets is the best assurance that your carpets do not smell.
Replace carpets when it is time. A good quality carpet today can last 25 years or more. But if your carpet is old and hopelessly stained, it can become a source of odors as well as a health risk, especially for asthmatics.

, High moisture areas--especially with poor ventilation--run the risk of developing mold. Mold is usually black, and often has a musty smell. Although bathrooms and damp basements are the most common areas mold develops, it can happen anywhere that is damp.


A bleach solution is mildew's worst enemy. Most mold cleaners use bleach to attack mildew. You can make your own bleach solution, although sometimes a scouring cleaner or one bought at a store is preferable. Use as directed, with plenty of ventilation.
Ventilate the area as much as possible; mold requires a wet environment. Use the bathroom fan and open the window when possible.
Serious cases of ""black mold"" can be a bio-hazard that may require professional removal. Most larger home improvement stores offer test kits to determine if that stain is simply mildew or a potentially more serious issue.

, Clutter, by itself, does not cause odors. However, when homes are full of boxes, totes, piles of stuff, and so on, it becomes increasingly difficult to clean. When cleaning becomes unnecessarily frustrating, it tends to happen less and less often. But it is also not unusual for smells to occur because:


Cluttered rooms offer vermin places to hide and thrive. Mice, cockroaches, rats, and so on love having quiet areas with plenty of places to hide. Also, if the kitchen offers plenty of food to get into, it becomes the ideal situation for pests. Vermin defecate, and occasionally die in houses, causing horrible odors.
Clutter can also harbor mold. A humid summer may cause water to be trapped in your piles of stuff. That can cause mold to grow, and potentially smell.

, Fresh, clean air in your home is important in controlling odors. Look into:


Open the windows. If possible, get fresh air inside by opening the windows on fair weather days.
Use a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air, reducing smells and help prevent mold growth.
Use air conditioning. Your home air conditioning unit also removes moisture from the air, and can help cut down on smells.
Check your ventilation. Inadequate or broken ventilation systems in your home can cause excess moisture, and therefore, smells.
Use dehumidifying crystals for small areas. These are basically giant-sized versions of desiccant packets. They often come in tubs or other containers. These items remove moisture from the area in small places with limited ventilation, such as a closet, under a sink, or in a RV. In America, Damp Rid is commonly available in home improvement stores.

, Whether you smoke, or you had a small fire, smoke is a pungent and hard to remove smell. In general, you will follow much as the same advice as above:


Wash and clean fabrics.
Vacuum carpets.
Air out the space as much as possible.
Try an air purifier to remove smoke particles from air.
Wash your walls. A multipurpose cleaner, used as directed, can greatly help smoke odors. A cleaner such as TSP does an even better job, and is available in most home improvement and hardware stores in America.
Repaint your walls. A fresh coat of latex paint will often remove a lot of smoke odor from home interiors.

Pay attention to when tickets go on sale.",How to Get VIP Tickets," Most of the time you can find VIP packages on sale through ticket retail services such as Ticketmaster. You should also check websites that deal exclusively with VIP packages., Fan club members occasionally get access to tickets before they actually go on sale. These ""presales"" give you the chance to shop for tickets before anyone else. Be on the lookout for VIP packages if you get a presale notification.Joining a fan club may cost you some money, but it usually comes with a fair amount of perks. By joining a fan club, you may also have the option of entering contests to win prizes, including VIP packages.

, Radio stations often have ticket give away contests. While it isn't a guaranteed way to get VIP tickets, it rarely costs any money. You can win anything from concert tickets to film festival tickets depending on the station you listen to.Check different radio stations for different contests. Visit the website of each radio station and look for a contest schedule.

, Call the venue that is hosting the event you'd like to attend. Ask them if they offer any VIP packages. If the tickets are sold through a third party, the venue will likely be able to point you in the right direction.

, Some ticket retailers post valuable information on social media. Follow these websites to stay updated on the availability of VIP packages and ticket presales.You will usually be required to enter a special code to gain access to these sales. If you're not a part of the community, you won't be able to shop.Keep an eye out for contests run through social media. If you find out about a contest, make sure you read all the rules. Not only will the rules let you know how the contest works, you may find out ways to increase your chances of winning., VIP packages are a hot commodity and are likely to sell out fast. Familiarize yourself with various online ticket retailers to ensure you get the tickets you want.Make accounts with different websites to make the check-out process easier. Stay logged in while you're waiting for tickets to go on sale.Buying tickets online can sometimes be difficult. A lot of vendors give you a set amount of time to purchase tickets. If you run out of time, you have to start all over. It might be helpful to practice buying tickets to make sure you know how each website works. You don't have to buy anything, but you can still get familiar with the check-out process., VIP packages are not cheap, and some are well over $1000. You may need to start saving well in advance to make sure you can afford the VIP package when it goes on sale.Some events will cost quite a bit more than others. For example, if you want VIP tickets to a farewell tour, you're going to spend a lot more than if you were going to a standard show. Likewise, VIP tickets to a special sporting event, such as the Super Bowl, will be much harder to get than VIP tickets to a regular season game.
Plan ahead to make sure you know how much, and how long, you have to save.

, If you're serious about getting VIP tickets, you need to get them soon. The good seats are usually the ones that sell the fastest, sometimes within the first few minutes. If you know that tickets go on sale at 10 AM, make sure you're logged in and ready to buy a few minutes before."

Considering what you need to make your video before you start will ensure that the creation of the video is as smooth as can be.


Pay attention to lighting. Proper lighting is important, so consider filming in a location with good natural lighting during the daytime, or consider bringing your own lights to your filming location so your educational video will have a bright feel.
Locate a decent microphone. A good microphone will help your message come through loud and clear on your educational video. Even a small microphone can improve the quality of your video immensely.
Consider the goals of your video. Are you making this video to be shown at a professional workshop or in a classroom? If so, you may want to invest in a higher-quality camcorder for more professional recording. However, if you are making this video for fun, you may be more comfortable filming on a piece of equipment you already have such as a tablet or smart phone.;
, An optimal location for filming will be a place where you feel comfortable and can set up the necessary equipment to film your educational video. Additionally, you will want a place where surrounding noise is at a minimum, as this will can interfere with your video.Visit the location before you start filming if possible. Pay attention to the noise level at different times of the day, and pick your desired backdrop to film your video.

, After you film your video, you will likely want to make some edits. A tool such as Windows Movie Maker (for a PC) or iMovie (for a Mac) can be very helpful for editing your finished educational video. This software will allow you to import and edit videos, add and edit audio, and share your movie online.Consider using additional technical aids to add in interesting features. Tools such as Go!Animate (which allows you to create cartoons), Google Story Builder (which allows you to create mini-movies and video stories), and Stupeflix (which will animate pictures and videos into a slide show) can make your homemade educational video look professional., Find a site where you want to upload your educational video for the world to see. YouTube is a great option in that it has the best tools for working with your videos and allows you to embed or share videos with ease.Many people choose to upload their educational videos to YouTube.


Watch other educational videos. Before you create your own video, it may be helpful to review some other videos to find out what to do and what not to do.

, A quick YouTube or Google search of your topic can help you determine what kind of videos already exist on the subject matter.


Do not be deterred by the existence of a similar video. Many people will watch multiple videos to learn something new.
Figure out how to make your video stand out from the rest. Identify anything that you may want to know that is not included in any other video, and make sure you include it in your own.

, Pick something that you know best, or learn about something new and tell the world what you have learned.


Determine what kind of educational video you want to make:

Will this be a “how-to” video, or will you be providing in-depth information on a particular topic?
Will there be interactive activities, or will you be talking throughout the video?


Make an outline of how you want your video to proceed before you start filming.

, Adequate preparation for your educational video is key. Many people (especially those who are camera-shy) are more comfortable speaking in front of a camera once they have rehearsed what they want to say.


Make sure you have your facts correct. Before making an educational video, double-check to make sure that the information you will be providing is correct. You don’t know how many people will watch this video!

, The key to creating an educational video in which you seem like an expert is to be confidence in your message. The best way to gain this confidence is through repetition.


Practice in front of a mirror. Doing a run-through of your script with no one around to judge it can be a good way to iron out kinks and gain confidence.
Practice with a friend, and have her give you feedback. It may be beneficial to have another person listen to your script before you film it and publish it.
If possible, practice speaking from memory without the assistance of notes.

, Think about the message you are trying to convey, and locate any props that will make this message clearer and your video more stimulating.


Watch other educational videos to see if and how they effectively use props. While it is important not to directly copy any other video, you may be inspired by what you see on other videos.
Remember that a prop can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. There are no specific guidelines to creating your own educational video! The props that you use in your video will be unique to the topic you are presenting.

, Remember that speaking in front of a camera can feel a lot different from speaking in front of your mirror. The more practice you can get, the better your video will be.


Film your dress rehearsal if possible. This will allow you to watch it over, review your performance, and identify any mistakes you may have made.
Ask a trusted friend to watch your video and provide critiques. A neutral third party may be able to better identify errors or potential distractions in your video.

, While you can make an educational video by yourself, it can help to have someone working the camera so you can focus on the content that you want to convey. In addition, your cameraman can give you instantaneous feedback and can pay attention to things such as lighting and sound.

, As you are making an educational video, you will want your audience to feel like you are an expert on the subject, even if you aren’t!


Dress appropriately for your video topic. If you are talking about preparing for an interview, you may want to dress like you would for an interview; however, if you are explaining how to fix an oil leak on a car, you will likely want to be in different clothing.

, Research has shown that the average attention span lasts anywhere from 7 – 15 minutes.Remember this when making your video, and try to make your video as concise as possible while still getting your message across.

, After you’ve shot the necessary footage, you should upload the video on your computer for editing.


Make sure you save your raw footage as a separate document so that you can edit it and make changes in the future.

, Publish your video to a site like YouTube where it will reach a broad audience. It may even go viral!


Check out wikiHow’s page on editing videos for YouTube as a great starting point.
Consider using the “YouTube for Creators” page on the YouTube site. This site will help you build your video production skills, understand your audience, and improve your YouTube channel., Your audience will be a great source of feedback for your video. Pay attention to how many “likes” and “dislikes” your video receives, and look for any constructive comments that may be posted.


Ignore negative or rude commentary. Don’t pay attention to any personal attacks or criticism that isn’t constructive!

, YouTube, for example, allows you to see who is watching your video, for how long they are watching your video, the ages and locations of people who are watching your video, and other helpful statistics.This can help you understand the demographics of the people you are reaching with your educational video.

Find the right head covering.,
Get good gloves.,
Purchase a warm coat.,
Buy a warm pair of boots.,
Look for a good pair of socks.,
Consider other important gear.",How to Spend More Time Outside During Winter3," The ideal winter hat will keep your head warm while you are outdoors but, depending on the activity, prevent it from getting too hot. For most activities, a simple wool cap that covers your ears should suffice. If you are doing more strenuous activities, you might consider a winter headband that allows heat to escape from the top of your head while keeping your ears warm.Ear muffs are also a great choice if you want to keep your ears warm but prevent the rest of your head from overheating.
If you want to keep your neck and face warm, you should consider a scarf. You can wrap it around your neck and pull it over your face if it gets too cold.
Ultimately, you might want a number of winter caps. You might want to consider a thick cap for walking around in the snow and a light cap for running, snowshoeing, or doing other high-energy activities.

, Protecting your hands is essential to enjoying the outdoors during winter. Proper gloves will keep you from getting too cold or developing frostbite. If you are walking around or ice skating, you may want a thicker glove made from wool. For playing in the snow, skiing, or snowshoeing, you will want a thicker glove that is also waterproof. Depending on the activity, you may also want a glove that affords you some dexterity to use your phone or manipulate things with your fingers.Ultimately, you may want to have different gloves depending on the activity., A warm winter coat is essential to enjoying the outdoors during winter. In general, you will want a thick insulated coat.However, if you are going to be more active, you may opt for lighter clothing that helps you stay warm but keeps you from overheating.In addition, layering can also help you stay warm by creating pockets of warm air and preventing moisture from seeping in.Consider investing in at least two winter coats, a heavier one for general use and a lighter coat for any strenuous outdoor activities.
A down-filled puffer coat is great for staying warm. However, it is not a great option if you are going to be doing anything active because you can easily get overheated. Also, down absorbs moisture and loses much of its warmth if exposed to humidity.If you are going to be active outdoors, you might want to consider a ski coat that offers water-resistance and helps keep you cool.

, Depending on the activity, there are a number of things to consider when looking for a good winter boot. Generally, you want a boot that is insulated and waterproof. If your feet get wet and cold, you will quickly cool down and you run the risk of hypothermia. If you are doing any snowshoeing or playing in the snow, you might want to consider a waterproof boot that gives you a little more flexibility.Finally, skiing, snowboarding, and skating all have their own footwear with special considerations.


Be sure to talk with a sales representative when you buy any boots for skiing or snowboarding. They will help you get the appropriate boots.

, A good pair of socks helps keep your feet warm and dry. For brief excursions outdoors, wear a thicker sock that traps more warm air and keeps your foot insulated. If you are going to spend an extended period outdoors, you should wear two to three layers of socks to keep your feet warm and dry.When layering socks, you might want to start with a lightweight wicking sock, covered by a lightweight wool sock, with a medium wool sock on top. This combination will keep your feet warm while wicking away moisture.

, Depending on the activity, you will need to consider other pieces of equipment or clothing. If you are skiing or snowboarding, you will need to find skis or a snowboard that are the right size. You will also need goggles to protect your eyes from ice and glare and a sturdy helmet to protect your head. If you are on the ice, you may want ice grabbers to attach to the bottoms of your boots. Make sure that you know what equipment you will need to perform the specific outdoor activity.


A sales associate at a local sporting goods or outdoor store should be able to help you find the gear that will work best for your outdoor adventures.

Distract yourself from cramps.",How to Survive Your Period when You Live With All Guys," Don't let yourself run out of sanitary towels or tampons. If you are mature enough to live away from your parents and with 'guys' you should be able to maintain a supply of appropriate products.

, Get a lot of toilet paper and fold it neatly into a similar shape to what a pad looks like, the longer and thicker, the better. Place it as you would use a regular pad and wrap the end of the big piece or even another piece around everything a few times to keep it all in place, make sure you do this before going to bed or you're definitely going to have menstrual fluid all over your panties in the morning.


Try to change these every 1-2 hours depending on what day you're on in the cycle.;
, Fold it to the size of a regular pad, then stick it in your underwear. Make sure you have extras on hand, since you may have to change once every hour or two.

, Is there someone you can go to in a hurry to beg for a pad or two from? Always give back a fresh new package of pads if you resort to this.

, This can help you cope with the potential embarrassment of having to ask one of the guys for some.

, If you can't get out to get sanitary gear for yourself, ask the most switched-on guy in the household to get out there and buy some pads or tampons for you. It's probably best to target the guy who has sisters; it won't be odd to him. It will be odd if you wince, grimace or make a song and dance about it though; talk about it as natural (after all, it is) and keep the request simple. Don't apologize for having your period, although it's okay to apologize for not being organized enough.


If you're comfortable and casual about the fact of having a period (""Hey.. would you mind getting me some pads on your run to the drugstore?""), then the guys are more likely to be comfortable too.
If asking a guy to buy you pads or tampons, be specific. He probably doesn't know which brands are best or what you like, so make sure to tell him exactly what you need- write it down for him to make it easy.
You might want to just tell the oldest guy, or the guy you're most comfortable with, about your period and tell him that you need some help.

, You'll notice that the more you exercise, the less menstrual fluid and pain there is. Be sure to keep your own limit in mind, if you think you are too tired/painful, you need to stop. Sports can help a lot, but with some people, the 'damage' you cause to your muscles, takes longer to heal when you're on your period. Do not risk any injuries and stop when you need to stop. You're feeling unwell and it's not a shame to just lay in bed for three days, if you feel like you have to.

, You might be able to fake a headache and get some other painkiller, but in case you don't then try these things: doing something you enjoy a lot, watching a funny or scary movie, again with the exercising thing, you'll even find that you might be able to sit a certain way that stretches you stomach and helps with the pain.

, Consider your background and education, and the sort of things you enjoy doing. Choose a program that matches your particular skills and abilities.


Earthwatch organizes scientific expeditions to help scientists collect measurements and other vital data.United Planet has programs in Peru involving healthcare and childcare.
Organizations such as EarthWatch and GVI (Global Vision International) offer opportunities to connect with nature.
Many programs offer experience teaching English as a second language. Some programs require a college degree or teaching experience; others will allow any native speaker to teach.
In the aftermath of a natural disaster, volunteer organizations like the Red Cross and Relief International send workers to help rebuild communities.
Because of the nature of these assignments, the work can be extremely stressful and emotionally taxing.
WIDECAST has programs in Latin America involving environmental conservation, farming, and monitoring endangered sea turtles.

, Most short-term overseas volunteer programs charge a fee to cover administrative costs, food, lodging, and ground transportation. The costs of different programs can vary greatly. For example:The WIDECAST Latin America Program charges $315 for one week, or $430 for two weeks. This covers your in-country costs and training.
Global Volunteer Network has programs starting at $797 for two weeks, plus a $350 application fee. This covers Spanish lessons, internet access, airport pick-up, food, and lodging.
The Costa Rica projects at i-to-i will cost you $1,299 for two weeks. This covers food, lodging, airport shuttle, orientation, and training.

, Nearly all programs require you to pay for your own airfare. How much this costs depends on where you live, and where you are going. For example, airfare from the US to Australia will run about $1,500; airfare from the US to Costa Rica will cost $500-700., If you are applying to a program that allows you to bring your children, you'll need to arrange the trip to fit in with your kids' summer or winter breaks.

Try to step out of the stereotypical popular girl look, and make an attempt to not dress like your friends. Instead, find your own fashion statement. You can do this by finding clothes that you are comfortable with and help you to bring out the character within you. Remember that the clothes you wear give people an impression about who you are and the type of person that you want to be.;
, If it's naturally greasy, wash it every day or every other day. If it's dry, wash it every two or three days, and be sure to use conditioner. If it's normal, wash it every other day, with a small bit of conditioner. Brush your hair after your shower, when you wake up, and when you go to bed. If you use heat on your hair, don't do it too often, as it will damage your hair. Try doing something pretty with your hair everyday so it shows that you take care of yourself.

, Try to make it unique and just for you, but make it fit in a little. If someone copies your style, it may be annoying, but this just means they like you and see you as a role model. People follow the popular people's style, right?

, Makeup isn't to cover up your flaws, it's to outline your best features. If you love your smile, wear lip gloss or lipstick. If you have amazing eyes, wear mascara and eye shadow. Maybe wear some powder or foundation to get smooth skin. People will start to notice how beautiful you are.

, Be nice to everyone, even the mean girls, and people will notice you. If you're mean to people, they'll be mean to you. You can be popular and not be friends with the ""populars"". Make friends with everyone!

, Don't just try out for cheerleading or soccer, instead, try to supplement your activities with what interests you. This could be joining a chess club or a marching band.

, Good grades are the most important thing in school. Sure, being popular is fun, but without good grades, you'll fail in the future.

Be prepared to urge the subject into a deeper hypnosis.,
Rock the subject's head.,
Try a countdown.,
Begin priming your subject to wake.,
Wake the subject.",How to Use Rapid Hypnosis," It’s imperative that you talk to your subject in a way that calms and relaxes him. Practice speaking slowly, with some rhythm and melody and no harsh or discordant tones. Use this as an opportunity to practice your script; if you struggle with what you want to say during induction it will break the subject’s focus.You also should not sound like you’re reading off a script. Practice will help you sound natural.;
, You will want to make sure that he is relaxed. Inform him that you might touch him lightly, so that he is not surprised in a way that would cause him to break focus. If your subject is wearing a skirt, give her a blanket to put over her legs so that she does not need to worry about the way she positions herself.


Similarly, tell your subject that is okay if he coughs or moves. If he is struggling to suppress a biological function, it will likely break his focus.Similarly, tell him to keep his legs uncrossed, otherwise he might get caught up by repositioning his legs. If he is wearing glasses, have him remove them.

, A distinct sense of fear will prevent him from falling into hypnosis. You want to let him know what you will not be able to manipulate them and that he will not be endangered by the hypnosis.


Simply indicate ""This is a perfectly safe procedure. You will enter into a state of increased relaxation and focus, but you will be in control the entire time.""

, Always begin by asking if he is ready to be hypnotized. Establishing consent is important for ensuring that he is mentally ready and should calm him as well.A simple, ""Do you agree to be hypnotized?"" should be sufficient

, Hypnotic subjects need to be willing to engage in the procedure and psychologically susceptible. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of subjects are moderately susceptible, 10% are highly susceptible, and another 10% have low susceptibility.Susceptibility is positively correlated to how well the subject is prone to fantasy and empathy.His ability to focus while, for example, reading, also correlates to susceptibility. It is often thought that hypnosis is easier in a relaxing environment with few external sounds or distractions. While this sort of hypnosis certainly won't hurt, some studies indicate that hypnosis is equally as easy to reach in disturbing settings, Ideally, he should press down with some force, but only be touching the edge of your hand, so that it will be easy for you to withdraw your hand when you are ready., Do this very rapidly shortly after having him press against your hand. That way, his attention will be occupied with two tasks simultaneously. , The goal is to surprise him.You should speak in a strong, authoritative tone when telling him to “sleep.”This whole process should take about four seconds. Surprise—and thus speed—is imperative.

, The initial shock of the eight word induction will fade if not followed up with a script that takes him into a deeper state of hypnosis. For this, follow up in a calm tone with a couple of sentences asking the subject to fall into a deeper sleep. The two best ways to deepen the hypnosis are described below: rocking the head and performing a countdown. Pick whichever you are most comfortable with; rocking the head will require some physical contact with the subject.

, If the subject is positioned so that he falls over into a slump after you pull away his hand, some hypnotists will begin to rock the subjects head with their hands to induce a more relaxed state. As you do that, you can tell him to let his neck relax and let that feeling of relaxation spread throughout his body. Tell him to let his mind and body relax until he fall into a deep sleep.


Tell him, for example: ""As I rock your head you will go deeper and deeper into a trance. The more I rock your head the deeper you go, the deeper you go the better you feel, the better you feel the deeper you go ... "" , Tell him that he will become more relaxed as you count down from 1 to 5. Every time you count down a number, describe to him how he is felling. “1, the relaxation is spreading through your body. 2, the relaxation is getting deeper. 3, your mind is becoming relaxed. 4, you no longer feel anything but the sense of relaxation. 5, your relaxation is getting deeper with every passing second.” Alternatively try something like: “10, you feel yourself relaxing. 9, going deeper and deeper. 8, doing excellently, keep going. 7, with each number I say you will be in a deeper trance. 6, deeper, excellent. 5, farther and farther, relax completely now. 4, 3, you're doing well. 2, even farther away from the world. 1, 0. You are now in a deep trance.”

, Shortly before you try to awake him, tell him that it is almost time to “wake up” and “become more aware.” To make the transition peaceful, indicate how he will feel when he comes out of hypnosis. Tell him that when he comes out of the trance he will feel “relaxed and comfortable.”


As you do this, use cues that will make him feel like he is returning to the real world. Stop speaking in such a slow, soothing tone and begin talking in a more normal conversational tone, like you would in everyday life. Call the subject by his name to remind him of his regular life., Tell him that he will awaken after you count down from 10. As you count down, talk in a progressively less calming tone. Say something like “10, you are feeling more awake. 9, you are beginning to become conscious. 8, you are remembering your life. 7, 6, you feel like you are waking from a deep sleep.”

Consider what the child is saying or doing.,
Be frank and clear.,
Be polite.,
Focus on the behavior, not on the child's personality traits.,
Be amiable.,
If the child persists in being rude, there are several things you can try.",How to Tell Someone Else's Child to Stop Being Rude," Be sure this is a battle worth entering, as trivial things are often best overlooked. Things that are of immediate concern include the child swearing at you, dropping constant f-bombs, name-calling, gouging holes in your soft furnishings, asking intimate questions or rifling through your undies drawer. Things that you might consider letting pass you by include back chatting to his or her own parents, refusing to eat something at your table or making annoying sounds. For the latter instances, take a deep breath; for the former, you are completely within your rights to say something pointed and frank.;
, Adults worry about ""social niceties"" and tend to beat about the bush when trying to convey messages about rudeness and other unacceptable social behaviors, because they're trying to be polite, save face, not tread on toes, etc. Children don't have this socially-ingrained baggage and are much more amenable to being corrected based on the facts presented to them. They understand direct and clear comments that go straight to the behavior in question. The child knows that he or she is doing something wrong or offensive; part of this is often about whether he or she will get called out on it. And when this does happen, the child will know that the game is up.

, Obviously remain polite. But avoid the temptation to sugarcoat the reality; if a child is cursing away, that is the behavior you point out. If a child is digging his or her stylus into your softwood coffee table and leaving holes behind, that is the behavior you point out.


Use the word please when asking the child to stop the behavior in question. It both shows your own restraint and kindness in instructing the child, and it also shows respect towards the child and parents. As an added bonus, it demonstrates the value of using manners when instructing others, something the child will pick up on.
If you are worried about the parents, manners will win the day. It is hard to fault a polite person, who has relied on respecting each other person involved by acknowledging them and using polite language.

, In other words, don't say: ""Johnny, you are such a bad boy, you will end up in jail."" Johnny will think, wow, this person is mean and why do they think I am bad?"" Instead, it is important to direct your comment at what Johnny is doing that bothers you. For example:


""Johnny. That was my favorite economics textbook. It disappoints me that you ripped out pages from it. I now have to buy another one for $89 and I don't have that sort of money. Please put the book down and sit quietly until your visit is over.""
""Missy, I appreciate that you are a sassy girl with lots of confidence. But it is not okay to call me ""@^$^%@&"" either to my face or behind my back. That is disrespectful and unkind. It also hurts my feelings. Please speak nicely about me from now on.""
""Rennie. I understand that you are feeling bored. I can give you some toys to play with from my son's old collection. So, please stop using my glass ornaments as shooting targets and I will fetch those toys for you. While I am fetching them, I am sure your parents will find you a nice and comfy spot to sit down on."" (Note how you can also bring the parents in to do their bit.)

, Use a soft and friendly tone. If you sound whiny bossy or angry, the child may cry, get aggressive or throw a tantrum. If the parents are present, it will reflect badly on you and if they're not there, it's likely they'll get the story secondhand. Stick to firm but polite, and treating this whole occasion as instructional and enlightening, not a telling off.


Smile after you have instructed the child to do something else. This indicates that ""the instruction is done now"" and ""we're not going to bring it up again"".

, For example:


If the child is visiting without parents: Talk to the child quietly but firmly, explaining that you like the child and that he or she is welcome to visit again and play with your children, etc. but that if he or she is not able to respect you/your family/your things, etc., that he or she will not be welcome back if this disrespect continues. Again, name the exact behavior that is bothering you along with how to solve it, and make it clear that once the warning has been given, it won't be raised again unless the child breaches it.
If the child is visiting with the parents: Ask the parents to stop the child from misbehaving. For example, you might say: ""Jenny and Rick, I love having you over here. I would be happy though if you would kindly ask your child to stop breaking my china ornaments. I have asked him/her to leave the ornaments alone and I have given him/her toys to play with but still the behavior is happening. Please ask your child to stop so that there are no more breakages during this visit. Otherwise, maybe it's time to finish up for today."" Many a parent will be mortified enough to respond quickly; if not, then maybe these people are not ideal visitors.

Contact animal control.",How to Report Excessive Dog Barking," The easiest way to report excessive barking is to call your city’s animal control department. Give the person on the other end of the phone the location of the dog and tell them how long the dog has been barking. You can find the animal control phone number by looking in your phone book or searching the Internet for “your city” and “animal control.”


In New York City, you can report excessive dog barking by calling 311.You can also report anonymously online.Depending on your city, you might have to contact a different department. For example, in Los Angeles, you need to contact your local animal shelter.If you can’t find the phone number for animal control, then call the police. They should direct you to the right number.;
, Some animal shelters will require that you send a letter. For example, Los Angeles requires that you send the following information in a letter to your nearest animal shelter:your name
your address
your phone number
the address of the barking dog
a description of the problem (such as when the dog barks)
your signature

, Your city’s police or animal shelter will send someone out to investigate. Realize that this person might not come out right away. Instead, the person may come to check on the dog at another time. You should be available to talk to the person investigating the barking dog.


Show the investigator where the dog is located and share any documentation, such as audio that you have recorded.

, In many cities, the city will respond to your complaint by sending the dog’s owner a letter, explaining how they can reduce the dog’s barking.If the dog continues barking, however, you need to report the barking once again to the appropriate authorities.

, Depending on your city or county, you may have to testify in court against the dog owner.You will probably be nervous. However, you should remember these tips for being an effective witness:Always tell the truth. It is illegal not to.
Never guess if you don’t know the answer to a question. Also be careful when providing estimates. Be sure to preface an estimate with the words, “If I have to give an estimate, then I’d say….”
Avoid humor. A court proceeding is serious business, and you should take it seriously.
Don’t get angry. Always try to remain calm and in control.

, Each city will have different rules about how much barking is “excessive.” Although you may find five minutes of barking late at night annoying, your city might not consider that amount of barking excessive. To find your city’s definition, search the Internet for “your city” and “excessive barking.”


For example, in Los Angeles, barking is excessive if it is continuous for 10 minutes or intermittent for 30 minutes within a three hour window.In New York City, by contrast, barking warrants calling law enforcement if it lasts continuously for 10 minutes or more between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 pm or for five continuous minutes between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am., You should carefully document the days and times when the dog is barking.If the dog barks mostly at night, keep a log beside your bed so that you can easily write down the duration of the barking.

, You can build your case by tape recording the dog barking. In some cities, police or animal control officers won’t come right away to investigate. Instead, they might stop by the animal’s house several weeks later and listen for 10 minutes to check if they can hear barking.In these situations, it is highly unlikely that the dog will be barking at the precise moment the investigator shows up to listen.


Accordingly, you should record audio of the dog barking so that you have proof.Use a digital recorder, tape recorder, or a camcorder. Your smart phone may be able to record video or audio.

, Experts disagree as to whether you should talk to the owner about the barking. In some situations, talking to the owner could be helpful. For example, the dog might bark only when the owner isn’t home, and the owner could be unaware of the barking.The owner could be grateful that you informed them of the problem.


However, some owners might become hostile if you complain about the dog. Complaints about excessive barking can escalate into tit-for-tat “wars” between neighbors: you complain about the dog, your neighbor makes up a complaint about you, etc.
If the dog owner becomes upset or annoyed when you talk, quickly end the conversation with a pleasant, “I just thought you should know” and don’t raise the issue again.

, Animal cruelty is very serious and should be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities. If you hear a wailing dog and investigate, then pay attention to the following signs of animal cruelty:open wounds or multiple healed wounds
a tight collar embedded in the dog’s neck
being extremely underweight
limping or inability to stand
heavy discharge around the nose or eyes
the owner hitting or otherwise abusing the animal

, The dog may be barking because it is in pain or suffering. You should first document the abuse, by writing down what you have seen.Give dates and times you have heard the animal howling. Also note if and when you saw the owner strike the dog.

, Don’t put yourself in danger. For example, you shouldn’t trespass on someone’s property, break into their garage, or approach an animal that looks wounded.Instead, take pictures from a safe distance, if possible.


Document the dates and times that you took the pictures.

, You should contact your local animal control or local animal shelter after you have gathered all of your information. Offer to meet the investigator to show them where the dog is located.

For instance, point out that skateboarding with your friends is a great way to bond and make new friends., If your birthday or Christmas is coming up, you could ask for a skateboard as a gift.If you only ask for the skateboard and nothing else, you are more likely to get it.


If it's not that time of the year, be patient. Don’t forget that you want the skateboard, and keep the idea to ask for it in the back of your mind until the right season approaches.

, Alternately, you could offer to pay for part of the skateboard with allowance money or money earned from a part-time job.


Offer to help more around the house by, for example, mowing the lawn or doing the dishes.
Do not promise to improve your grades (or do anything else) if you don’t think you can. If you make a promise that you don’t or can’t fulfill, your parents will be less willing to buy you the next thing thing you ask for, or trust you when you make a deal with them.

Care for your teeth.,
Bathe or wash regularly.,
Wash your hair.,
Wear clean clothes.",How to Look Healthier2," Taking care of your teeth can go a long way towards having a healthier appearance. Poor dental hygiene can lead to plaque, gum disease, tooth decay, and bad breath.Brush your teeth twice each day.To brush your teeth, squeeze out a pea-sized drop of toothpaste onto your toothbrush and scrub the inside, outside, and underside of each tooth's surface. It should take you about two minutes to thoroughly brush your teeth.Use dental floss. Flossing helps remove food debris stuck between your teeth and can also reduce gum disease and halitosis.To floss, take a strand of dental floss about 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) in length, wrap the ends around each index finger, and gently work the floss up and down as well as side-to-side between each tooth. Unroll a little floss from one finger while tightening the wrap on the other to ensure that you are not simply spreading plaque and debris from one tooth to the next.Use mouthwash, especially a mouthwash that contains fluoride. This will help kill germs, get rid of bad breath, and prevent tooth decay.To rinse, measure out about a half-cap to a cap full of mouthwash from the bottle, swish it around in your mouth, and spit it out without swallowing any., A shower or bath is ideal, but a sponge bath (wiping down with a wet sponge or washcloth) is a good alternative if they are not available.For best results, use a soap or body wash that you like. Try to balance fragrance with moisturizing capabilities so that your skin does not become irritated by the soap.
Daily bathing is a social norm, and not necessary for health or hygiene. In fact, some dermatologists say that daily washing strips your skin of natural oils and beneficial bacteria. Most adults can stay clean and healthy by washing every other day instead., It's important to wash your hair with shampoo or soap at least once each week, though many people prefer to wash their hair on a daily basis.Having clean hair is an important part of personal hygiene maintenance, and it will help you look healthier and feel more confident.


Thoroughly wet your hair.Squirt a glob of shampoo into the palm of your hand. A quantity about the size of a quarter should be sufficient, though if your hair is very long you may need more shampoo.If you tend to have dry, frizzy hair, try using a moisturizing shampoo. Look for haircare products that contain natural oils like olive oil, or other moisturizing agents like glycerin and shea butter. Avoid products containing mineral oil and petroleum, as these may further dry out your hair.Rub the shampoo into your hair and gently massage your scalp. Don't scrub your scalp too hard, though, as this may cause pain and irritation.Rinse all the shampoo out of your hair. Make sure there is no more shampoo remaining in your hair, as this may cause irritation.Let your hair air dry, or use a towel to gently dry off your head. Try to avoid using a hair dryer whenever possible, as it can dry out or irritate your hair and scalp., Clothes can carry dirt, germs, and unpleasant body odors. Re-wearing clothes multiple times can cause you to appear dirty or unhealthy. For best results, wash your clothes with laundry detergent any time they become soiled or have been worn more than once.Using a dryer or hanging your clothes directly in the sun can help kill germs that may have lingered through the washing machine. If you are using an unclean water source to wash your clothes, you also run the risk of carrying microscopic parasites in your clothing, even after washing. Use heat or direct sunlight, rather than simply air-drying your clothing indoors, to prevent the spread of germs and parasites."

Prepare the roof surface by removing any old roofing, any rotten wood, and adding roofing felt to the entire surface.,
Calculate the number of sheets of corrugated metal needed.,
Place your first metal sheet in a corner of the roof, flush against the surface.

,
Nail in the first metal sheet to the wood of the roof.,
Place the second metal sheet alongside the first with an overlap of 3 to 4 inches (or 10 cm).,
Nail the second metal sheet to the roof.

,
Continue with the other sheets, overlapping on every side of each sheet except for at the edges of the roof.

,
Secure ridge caps to the bottom lip of the roof.,
Test the roof for any loose spots or places where water can seep in.,
Paint the corrugated roof, if desired.

",How to Install Corrugated Metal Roofing,"


Roofing felt is a cheap and easy-to-install material: simply nail the sheets into wood, overlapping each sheet by 3 to 4 inches (or about 10 cm).;
, Divide the area of your roof by the size of the sheets you will be using. Remember that you will want the metal sheets to overlap.

,, You should use about 20 nails per sheet. Whenever possible, nail in the valley between the ridges, where the roofing is closest to the wood.

, Secure the sheets together using hex screws and washers.


Whenever possible, line up the ridges of each metal sheet. This will create a tighter roof and make it easier to drill in the screws. Screw in the spaces between where you nailed the first sheet to the wood.

,,, Follow the same method as when installing the metal sheets: overlap the ridge caps both with each other and with the sheets, using hex screws and washers where the metal overlaps and nails where the ridge caps attach to wood.


You will use about 40 nails for each length of ridge cap.

, If any roofing is sticking up, secure it as much as possible with nails or screws if attaching it to other metal sheets.

The PIT maneuver is a procedure which has been used by law enforcement departments around the world (this is also known by some as the Precision Immobilization Technique).,
Before the PIT maneuver is performed, it is assumed that Car A is approaching Car B from behind.,
Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B.,
At speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A.,
If Car A gives the initial tap with enough force, Car B's back-end should slide out.,
Be prepared for Car B to try to drive off as soon as they have slowed enough to regain control.",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)6," Vehicles at high speed are, by laws in physics and aerodynamics, inherently less stable than at lower speeds. The rear of the vehicle is also fundamentally less stable than the front of the vehicle (especially a RWD vehicle, under acceleration).

, The faster the speed (freeway speeds), the greater the advantage Car A has.

, It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A.

, At speeds closer to 40 mph (64 km/h), Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.

, Car A will need to straighten out, as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B. For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B.

, An experienced driver in a FWD vehicle could recover and drive off in the original direction at surprisingly fast speeds. An experienced driver in a RWD vehicle will, once the vehicle is slowed most of the way, likely try to accelerate in the opposite direction of the initial pursuit. AWD vehicles may be able to go either direction.

This is a very difficult and dangerous maneuver, and should only be performed if you have been trained in the technique.
Find out more about this maneuver by reading How to Use the Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT Maneuver) in a Car.

Include pictures, videos, and stories that define your marriage.Sites such as WordPress or Weebly allow you to easily build a low-cost page that is suited to your needs and tastes.
Alternatively, you can find local professionals or online companies (like GoDaddy.com) to create your website for you.

, Bring back memories and milestones in your marriage by recreating events. Think of the most romantic and happiest moments in your marriage and reenact them. Plan down to the smallest detail: where were you, what was the occasion, what were you wearing, what was said?


For instance, take your partner back to the place where your marriage proposal occurred. Instead of asking them to marry you, vow to never be apart from this day forward.Reenact your first date. Go back to the same place, order the same food, do the same activities. Remember to fill your spouse in on the significance of the memory for you; what is memorable to one person, might not be to the next. Either way, it is meaningful to the relationship.
Relive the first kiss. Once again, go back to the same place and demonstrate why the memory has had such a lasting impact on you. This is also a great time to create new memories.

, What better way to celebrate your life together than to have it immortalized in a work of art? Choose a specific item (whether person or thing) that represents your love for one another, and have it drawn, painted, or sculpted into something you can share.


You don't have to go with a traditional drawing or painting of yourselves. Instead think of objects that represent your love: your wedding bands, a customized home portrait, or even an abstract creation will do.Think about the medium of the work of art and what will fit your personal style. Would you prefer a painting, a sculpture, a drawing, or photography?

, Definitely non-traditional, but nothing says forever like identical wedding ring tattoos. Choose a symbol or design that represents you and your loved one. Popular items include words or phrases, signs and symbols, important dates, or basic bands.


While they are growing in popularity, they always come with a warning: remember, tattoos are forever.
The placement of the tattoo on the ring finger makes it both small and intricate to tattoo. Be sure to research your tattoo artist prior to obtaining the tattoo to make sure they have the experience and skill level needed."

Provide feedback.,
Try some time apart.,
Consider contributing factors.,
Involve people you trust.,
Seek professional help.",How to Handle Difficult Children3," One way to help a difficult child learn better behavior is to consistently provide feedback. By letting the child know what is and is not appropriate, you are helping to teach him ways to improve. Make sure that you are consistent in your reactions to certain behaviors or actions.


Provide social feedback. Let your child know how you feel by offering verbal praise or corrections. For example, you might say, ""Thank you for remaining calm today, Tim. I know it was disappointing that it rained and you couldn't go to the park.""
Provide concrete feedback. It can be useful to visually measure your difficult child's behavior. One way is to try a points system. For example, you could make a chart and post points every time your child does something positive (like cleaning her room without being asked). You can detract points for negative behavior. Visualizing the impact of her behavior can help your child learn the benefits of more positive actions.

, If you and your child are continuously experiencing conflict, you might need a little space. Taking a brief time-out can give both you and your child the time needed to calm down and reflect. Some space can go a long way towards solving problems.Ask a close friend or relative to watch your child while you take some time for yourself. It can be emotionally draining to handle a difficult child, so try to take some time each week to do something for yourself. Go to a movie or have dinner with a friend.

, You should consider whether your child is being difficult for a very specific reason. For example, maybe he is not getting enough sleep and is reacting by being difficult. A solution could be that you adjust your child's schedule and make sure that he gets the right amount of rest.There are many other factors that could impact your child's behavior. For example, maybe he is dealing with a health issue that you don't know about. Watch for any signs of physical discomfort, including lack of appetite or change in energy level.

, Remember that you are not alone. Hopefully, you have family and friends who can help you deal with this frustrating situation. Don't be afraid to ask someone you trust for advice.


Your friends and family can help in a couple of different ways. They might be able to communicate well with your child, and you can enlist their help in solving the problem. They might also just be willing to take care of your child for an evening, giving you a much needed break.

, Sometimes your child might need some help that you simply cannot provide. If your child's behavior seems beyond simple acting out, and has been going on for a while, it might be time to contact a mental health specialist. Many therapists specialize in treating youths, and can help you find a way to help your child.Ask your family doctor to recommend a therapist he trusts.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. There is no shame in helping your child live the best life he can.

Stick with something you want to be better at.,
Talk to someone about it.,
Ask yourself what you can learn from the experience.,
Recognize that dwelling on something prolongs its effect on you.",How to Overcome a Blow to Your Ego2," Maybe a friend said some nasty things about your series of fashion selfies. Or an art critic voiced their confusion about your approach to painting. Or you didn’t make the ball team, despite trying your hardest. In these cases, the best response is to buckle down, bang out a few push-ups (figuratively or literally), and get back to work honing your craft., When something gives your ego a knock, admitting to to someone else can not only feel good, it can lead to renewed motivation to get your mind back on track. It doesn’t matter if you’re speaking to a workplace mentor, a close friend, or a mental health professional.If you're hesitant to speak with someone but you keep thinking about something that happened, remind yourself that it’s a sign of emotional maturity if you’re able to admit it when you’re bummed.
Simply pull someone you trust aside at some point and say something like, ""Geez, James said something earlier that really got to me. I've still been thinking about it and I'd like to get it off of my chest. Can we talk for a minute?""

, It can be helpful and motivating to reflect on your own. In fact, many people are motivated by experiences of defeat or humiliation to examine their prior behavior or level of effort and adjust to prevent a similar experience from happening again.To aid in your reflection, ask yourself questions like, “What could I have done differently that might have prevented this?”
In this way, you can challenge yourself to address the matter in a healthy and productive way by thinking it through without someone else.

, As important as honest conversation and reflection may be, it’s also important to move on shortly after receiving a blow to the ego. Address and manage your emotions, and then focus on other aspects of your life.Thinking too much about what might have been, or how something might have gone differently, will prolong your discomfort and prevent you from spending your time thinking about and doing more productive things.
Whenever a thought arises that you don't want to think about, simply push it away. Don't become frustrated if it keeps coming up, just take a deep breath and focus on something else.

Ensure your kitchen is properly ventilated.,
Wash the wok.,
Apply some type of fat.,
Allow the wok to cool.,
Repeat the process.",How to Cook With a Wok2," Seasoning your wok helps create a natural non-stick surface, so food glides easily around when you're cooking. Before you start seasoning your wok, though, it’s important to ensure that the kitchen has adequate ventilation because the process creates smoke. Open all of the windows, and turn on an exhaust fan if you have one.Make sure that there are no flammable materials near the stove while you’re seasoning the wok.

, When you first purchase it, your wok have a factory coating of oil on its surface that protects the material and prevents rust. Before you can season it, you need to wash the oil away so it doesn’t burn off during the processing. Use a steel wool scrubber, dish soap, and hot water to carefully scrub the entire surface, both inside and out the wok.After you’ve washed the wok, make sure to dry it thoroughly before moving on in the seasoning process. Place it on a burn set at low heat, and let it sit for a couple of minutes -- or until you no longer see any water droplets on its surface.

, While the wok is still warm, use a heat-proof brush, such as the kind you would use for barbecuing, to apply a thin layer of fat or oil to the entire surface of its interior. Lard is a traditional choice, but you can also use an oil with a high smoke point, such as grapeseed, canola, peanut, or palm. Once the fat has been applied, place the wok on a burner set at high heat.Avoid using sunflower oil, safflower oil, flax oil, fish oil, or margarine to coat the wok. They leave a sticky coating.
While you’re heating the wok with fat in it, make sure to rotate it on the burner so that it’s heated evenly.
You’ll usually know that you’re done heating the wok when you start to see wisps of smoke coming off the surface.

, After the fat has burned for several minutes, remove the wok from the burner and allow it to cool completely. Once it’s at room temperature, use a paper towel to wipe its entire surface and soak up an excess fat or oil., While your wok is ready to be used after you’ve completed the seasoning process, you’ll get a better cooking surface if you repeat the process several times. You’ll know that the wok is properly prepared when its interior becomes dark and shiny.You can also tell that the wok is fully seasoned when the paper towel that you wipe it down with no longer comes back with brown or black ash.
When you’re heating the oil in the wok, you can also add aromatics, such as scallions, garlic, or ginger, to help with seasoning process.

Discuss whether to see an animal behaviorist.",How to Diagnose Behavioral Dysfunction in Senior Dogs," Cognitive dysfunction is another term for dementia. It occurs in senior dogs when the brain undergoes changes that cause it not to work very well. Cognitive dysfunction causes behavioral changes that may be mild at first, but worsen over time.If you see signs of cognitive dysfunction, take your dog to your vet:Disorientation: wandering aimlessly, getting lost when indoors, getting stuck in corners
Changes in social interaction: not seeking attention, not greeting people
House soiling: having bathroom accidents indoors, even in front of people
Altered sleep/wake cycle: waking up during the night, howling during the night;
, Senior dogs can become anxious when left alone. If your senior dog has separation anxiety, it may whine and howl, become destructive, and urinate and defecate in the house.Some dogs can become very aggressive when their owners are about to leave the house. Other dogs may pant or even hide.You may be tempted to crate your dog to prevent destruction or house soiling. However, if your dog isn’t used to being crated, this could create even more anxiety., Dogs can develop fears later in life because of cognitive dysfunction, as well as sensory losses (hearing, sight, touch). For example, your senior dog may become fearful of thunderstorms or become reluctant to step on different types of surfaces.It may also fear change to its environment (new pet, new family member).


If you notice your dog is afraid of something that it wasn’t afraid of before, write down what that fear is. Also, write down your dog’s reaction to that fear (hiding, whining, wanting to be closer to you).

, Senior dogs can begin performing repetitive behaviors. For example, a senior dog may repetitively lick certain parts of its body, repeatedly chase its tail, or suck on its flank for long periods of time.Anxiety is a common cause of repetitive behaviors in dogs., Just like with people, dogs can lose their hearing with age.If your senior dog can’t hear as well as it used to, it either won’t respond to you at all, or take longer to do so.


If you think your dog is losing its hearing, your vet can perform various tests to determine whether your dog has hearing loss.

, Dealing with your dog's behavioral dysfunction can be frustrating.Before you lose your patience with your senior dog, take it to the vet. Behavioral dysfunction in senior dogs is usually due to some underlying cause, such as decreasing brain function or chronic disease.


Examples of chronic diseases that can cause behavioral dysfunction are liver and kidney disease.
Do not delay in taking your dog to your vet. The sooner your vet can diagnose the behavioral dysfunction, the sooner you dog can receive treatment for the problem.

, A history of your senior dog’s behavioral dysfunction will help your vet diagnose the problem. During the appointment with your vet, tell them about any behavioral changes you’ve noticed in your dog. No matter how major or minor you think the problems are, it will be important for your vet to know what’s changed about your dog’s behavior.


When you give your vet the history, include when the behavioral problems started and if they have gotten worse over time.

, Because behavioral dysfunction can sometimes be caused by underlying diseases, your vet will need to determine whether your senior dog has other medical problems. To do this, they will first perform a physical exam.Your vet will examine the outside of your dog’s body and listen to its heart and lungs.


During the physical exam, your vet may also test your dog’s hearing and vision. Not being able to hear or see very well could affect your dog’s behavior.

, Urine and blood samples can indicate whether your dog has a medical problem. For example, kidney disease would cause abnormalities in the blood and urine. For liver disease, the blood sample would have abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes.

, A neurologic exam will allow your vet to see how your dog’s brain is functioning. It will also help your vet rule out other medical causes of the behavioral problems.Your vet will evaluate different things during the exam exam:Gait and posture: observing of how your dog walks and positions its body
Mental status: observing how your dog interacts with you and your vet during the exam (alertness vs disorientation)
Cranial nerve function: testing the nerves in your dog’s brain
Postural reactions: determining whether your dog knows where its limbs are when not looking at them
Spinal reflexes: testing the function of different nerves

, If your senior dog’s behavioral dysfunction is complex, your vet may refer you to an animal behaviorist for a more detailed behavioral examination. Based on the exam results, the behaviorist will recommend a treatment plan for your senior dog. The website http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/behavioral-help-your-pet can help you locate an animal behaviorist in your area."

In this way, you not only prepare yourself for sharing the experience more widely, but you also learn about the experience at a deeper level for yourself and hopefully also take this chance to reflect on how you might approach things differently next time if the learning experience was more of a negative one. Questions that you might ask yourself include:


What did I learn?
What lessons can I extrapolate from this experience to bring to the organization?
What was good about this learning experience?
What was bad about this learning experience?
How can I build on both the negative and positive aspects of this experience?

, Select the appropriate organizational team people who will benefit from your learning experience and who can expand upon its import for the rest of the organization. Initially, tell the team about the experience and about what you learned. However, this time you should also aim to elicit team responses to how they perceive the learning event and how they see its applicability to the organization. The team should be made up of individuals who are able to address issues that have been raised and come up with solutions, actions and outcomes.

, In a situation involving a client, the ability to ask the client about the experience is invaluable. This time, frame the questions using ""we"" and genuinely seek answers from the client that can help to improve both the client's experience and the working patterns and deliverables of your organization. This is not meant to be a confrontational exercise but is a genuine attempt to come to grips with areas of weakness in your organization and they may well be areas that nobody has considered before or has only danced around. Finally, clients appreciate being asked, so this does a great deal for building a strong relationship. Questions that you might consider asking the client include:


Did we do a good job for you this time?
If not, why not and how do you feel we could have made this a better experience for you?
Are there particular areas that you feel need greater attention?
What did you like about your experience with us?
Is there any particular activity or event that you believe is superfluous to the achievement of a good outcome?

, Peers in your profession are also benchmarkers and innovators. They are watching you and you are watching them. Touch base through networks and exchange ideas and thoughts over recent learning experiences in a broad manner that does not breach client or organizational confidentiality. You can, and should, share experiences with peers. Some may have answers to problems that you are facing, some may appreciate your answers to problems that they are facing. Developing strong relationships even within a competitive context is vital to ensuring that all clients are receiving the best advice, skills and up-to-date information, so it pays back for all of you. Questions that you might consider asking include:


Why did you resolve X problem in that way?
What additional benefits did you foresee doing it like that as opposed to the way Y?
What recommendations would you make to someone doing this same thing?
What do you think the outcome would have been if you had done Y?
What thoughts do you have about developing Z instead?

, Unless you debrief for personal reasons, it is always a good reason to keep file or notebook records of debriefing sessions. That way you, your team and your organization can continue to learn from past lessons and the discussions surrounding these experiences. It will also help you to better recall what each of your clients expects of you in the future and gives you a good indication of how your client's organization operates and the types of expectations under which that organization may be working.

, Don't just stick the notes in the bottom drawer. Pursue the lesson actively and put into practice what you have learned. If you, your team or your organization generally needs extra skills or a change in direction, start implementing the things that need to be done to achieve this. Book yourself into a conflict management course, book team members into an updating seminar on the industry in which you work or make proposals for changes in direction about the ways that things are done, produced, manufactured and delivered within your organization. Use every debriefing session to build upon the last, to continuously strive for improvement from the individual level to the wider organizational community.

Locate plaque using a stain.,
Use the right kind of toothbrush and toothpaste.,
Use the correct brushing technique.,
Focus on each tooth individually.,
Remember to brush your tongue.",How to Remove Plaque1," Plaque is practically invisible, so it can be very difficult to know how much is on your teeth. To overcome this, you can purchase ""disclosing tablets"" in the grocery or drugstore. Once chewed, these tablets will stain the plaque on your teeth bright red, making it easy for you to examine your teeth for plaque and identify the areas you need to target with a toothbrush.


Green food coloring applied to your teeth with a q-tip will have the same effect, staining your teeth green for easy plaque identification.;
, To effectively brush your teeth and ensure that you are getting rid of as much plaque as possible, it is important that you have the right tools. Although there are many fancy toothbrushes on the market, the American Dental Association states that any ""soft nylon brush with rounded-end, polished bristles"" will do the trick.Hard bristled toothbrushes can be too abrasive and wear away tooth enamel and hurt your gums. Even if you are not using the correct brushing technique, soft bristles will still be better.


You will also need a good fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride strengthens teeth and protects them from decay and from the formation of cavities.
Electric toothbrushes are not any more effective at cleaning teeth than regular manually-operated ones. However, some people find that they are inclined to brush their teeth more regularly and for longer when they own an electric toothbrush, so investing in one may not be a bad idea.
Dentists recommend that you should replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months, as they become less effective at cleaning over time.

, When brushing your teeth, hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle against the gum line and sweep the brush away from the gums, in a short vertical, back-and-forth, or circular motions. Try not too scrub too hard, as this can actually damage the enamel on your teeth and cause high sensitivity to any type of stimulus., Pay attention to each tooth as you brush, making sure that you don't miss any. Remember to brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces and the chewing surfaces, and pay some special attention to those hard to reach teeth at the back. Brushing your teeth properly should take about two minutes -- try using a stopwatch to get a feel it, and hum a song to yourself to pass the time.

, Plaque can easily build up on the surface of the tongue due to food residues, so make sure to give it a little gentle scrub too. This will also help to freshen your breath.


When you brush your tongue, go from the back to the front of your mouth and repeating the gentle brushing motion 4 or 5 times.

Make a veterinary appointment.,
Discuss the cat's condition with your veterinarian.,
Allow a variety of testing to be done.,

Continue with follow-up care.",How to Diagnose and Treat Entropion in Cats," Entropion is a condition in which the eyelids are turned inward. This means that the cat's eyelashes are turned in towards the eyeball. If you see this occurring in your cat, it is likely that your cat has entropion.

This condition can affect from just one to all four of your cat's eyelids.;
, As the cat's eyelid turns in towards the eye, it begins to irritate the surface of the eye. This can cause an array of symptoms including:Redness
Light sensitivity
Tearing
Squinting
Discharge

, Persians or other brachycephalic breeds are more likely to have this genetic abnormality because of the different structure of their skulls.If you have one of these cats, you should be especially vigilant in looking for the signs of the condition.Cats without the stubby face of the brachycephalic breeds are more likely to have saggy or droopy eyelids instead of eyelids that are curled inward.

, Entropion often occurs in brachycephalic breed cats at birth. In these cases it has a strictly genetic cause and cannot be prevented, except through breeding programs the avoid using cats that have no family history of the problem.You should be on the lookout for entropion in kittens that are brachycephalic breeds. If newborn kittens do not open their eyes within four to five weeks after birth they should be assessed for this condition by a veterinarian., You should be on the lookout for entropion if your brachycephalic adult cat has had chronic infections of the eyes. Chronic infections, such as repeated bouts of conjunctivitis, can cause the condition to develop., As soon as you notice an abnormality with your cat's eyelids, you should make a veterinary appointment. Call your veterinary office, tell them about your cat's condition, and make an appointment for as soon as possible.

If your cat's eyelid is extremely infected and swollen and the cat seems very sick, you may want to bring your cat to see a veterinarian immediately. Call your veterinary office on the way there to warn them that you are coming in.

, When you bring your cat in for assessment, you should tell the veterinarian about the cat's symptoms. Discuss the cat's general health and answer all the questions the veterinarian asks you.

Feel free to ask the veterinarian questions about your cat's condition as they assess your cat.

, In order to figure out the right treatment for your cat, your veterinarian may need to complete a variety of tests. This could include a simple tear test to assess the cat's tear production and tests to identify any existing infections in the eye.

Tests will add to your veterinary bill but they are necessary in order to fight infections and to treat the abnormal eyelids. Without proper treatment of the condition and subsequent infections, your cat could lose its vision., There are several preliminary treatments that can be done on a cat with entropion before turning to surgery. To begin with, any underlying infections should be treated, usually with antibiotics. You can also apply artificial tears to the cat's eye to make movement of the lid easier.Discuss your treatment options with your veterinarian. The extent to which you can use non-surgical treatments on entropion depends on the severity of the condition.
Cats with severely turned eyelids may need surgical treatment right away.
In less severe cases of entropion, clearing up any infections in the eyes can cause the eyelids to go back to normal., The surgery used to treat entropion flips the eyelid right side out and removes skin so that it stays that way.If your cat has a severe case of entropion, it is likely that they will need this procedure.Even with surgical correction, your cat may still have spasms and infections of the eye. Thus, you will need to continue to assess the cat's eyes.

, After non-surgical treatments and surgical treatments your cat will need some care. Most importantly, make sure that the cat cannot touch its eyes by putting a cone onto it. Also make sure that the cat receives any medications that have been prescribed to it.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions about caring for your cat's sutures after surgery. Dressings should typically be changed regularly and the surgical wound should be kept clean and watched for signs of infection.
If your cat undergoes surgery, it may have some reactions when coming out of anesthesia. It may be extra sluggish for up to twenty-four hours after it wakes up."

Combine the dry ingredients.,
Add the shortening and water.,
Shape the mixture into patties.,
Heat the oil in a large skillet.,
Fry the patties until golden brown.,
Drain on paper towels.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Hot Water Cornbread1," Place the cornmeal, salt, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine.


Note that the sugar is an optional ingredient. Add it if you like mildly sweetened cornbread. Leave it out if you prefer savory cornbread.;
, Toss both ingredients into the cornmeal mixture, stirring until the shortening melts and the mixture seems evenly combined.The resulting dough should be thick enough to loosely hold its form, but it will still be quite sticky and difficult to pick up with your hands.

, Scoop up heaping tablespoons of dough. Use your fingers or a second spoon to form them into flattened balls or patties.


You should be able to get roughly 10 to 15 patties out of this dough.
Place the formed patties on a plate lined with wax paper. Alternatively, wait until after you heat the oil, then form and drop the patties directly into the skillet.

, Pour 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of vegetable oil into a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Cast iron skillets work best, but any large, heavy-bottomed skillet can be used.
Note that bacon fat, canola oil, or peanut oil can also be used instead of standard vegetable oil.
Test the temperature of the oil with a cooking thermometer. When the oil reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), move onto the next step.

, Gently place each dough patty in the hot oil. Fry the patties for approximately 5 minutes, or until the patties are golden brown on both sides.Only turn the patty once during the cooking process. Wait 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bottom edge of each patty starts to brown. Use a flat, heat-resistant spatula to carefully flip the patties to their uncooked sides.

, Remove the patties from the hot oil using a slotted spatula and transfer them to a plate covered in paper towels.


Try to position the patties in a single layer on this plate. If you stack them on top of one another, the oil may not drain completely.
Let the cornbread patties drain for 1 or 2 minutes.

, Enjoy the cornbread patties while they're still hot. You can eat them plain or add butter, maple syrup, honey, or fruit preserves.

Consider a long raincoat.,
Try a waist length raincoat.,
Buy a fisherman coat.,
Opt for an anorak style raincoat.,
Avoid a tight fitting raincoat.",How to Choose a Stylish Raincoat1," Long raincoats are typically in the style of a trench coat and can come in mid-thigh, knee, or calf-length varieties. They will help to keep your legs dry and are an excellent choice for walking around the city. You can also pair a long raincoat with a number of different outfits. For example, a long trench coat will look nice with jeans, dress pants, skirts, or dresses.Because long raincoats pair with so many outfits, they can be worn during the day or in the evening.;
, Shorter raincoats often look sportier and are best for daytime wear. They pair nicely with casual attire such as jeans or athletic gear. This style is also appropriate for outdoor activities such as hiking and camping., When you are shopping for a raincoat, you should also consider the fit. Unlike the trench coat, which has a belt to pull in the waist and accentuate your figure, the fisherman jacket has a more boxy shape. These raincoats are both stylish and practical and are perfect for protecting from the wind and rain., If you live in a cold and wet climate, you may want to consider purchasing an anorak style raincoat. These raincoats pull over the head and are insulated to keep you warm. They typically use draw strings at the waist and wrists to keep in the warmth., Typically, you will wear a raincoat overtop of a sweater, suit jacket, or cardigan. As a result, you should purchase a raincoat that is slightly larger in size and leaves room for your to layer your clothing underneath. This will allow you to stay warm and dry during rainy weather."

Determine if he is overly protective of his phone.,
Pay attention to his normal routine.,
Notice if he becomes more secretive.,
Notice if he has become less affectionate.,
Look for any behavior that is out of the ordinary.",How to Tell if Your Boyfriend Is Cheating1," If your boyfriend is cheating, he will become overly protective of his phone and computer. Does he get upset if you touch his phone or computer?His phone is probably what he uses to communicate with the other person he is seeing, and he wants to keep you as far away from his stuff as possible.


If you ask ""Who was that calling/texting you?"" he may say, “nobody,” or “don’t worry about it.”
Does he delete text message threads or Facebook messages before he lets you use his phone?
Does he run to answer the phone before you can see who is calling?;
, If your boyfriend is cheating, he has to make time for this other person in his schedule and change his routine.You probably know his usual schedule. If he starts hanging out with his guy friends more, studying late, or working late nights, he may be cheating.Your boyfriend will begin to choose all of these activities over spending time with you. You will no longer be a priority., Does your boyfriend close the door when you are around? Does he take his phone calls in another room? If your partner is cheating, he will begin to distance himself from you.Look for secrecy in any area of his life.Has he started hanging out with people that you don’t know?
If you ask him about where he is going or how his day was, does he only give a short answer with no details?, If your boyfriend is cheating, he may become less affectionate. Does he no longer want to hold hands, cuddle, kiss, or have sex? Is he no longer interested in the physical aspect of your relationship?


Keep in mind that your boyfriend could be less affectionate due to stress or health issues. Take into account the other signs before you decide that he is less affectionate because he is cheating., Your boyfriend may begin to change his behavior because he feels guilty about cheating. These behaviors can be positive or negative. Typical changes include:Buying gifts for no reason.
Going out of his way to be helpful and caring.
Picking fights with you.
Being more moody.
Smelling differently (e.g. another person’s perfume or cologne)
Paying extra attention to his appearance (e.g. clothing, new haircut, going to the gym)
Lying about things that are both big and small.Saying different phrases that he usually would not.
Keep in mind that cheating is not the only explanation for unusual behavior.

Know when to call a dentist.,
Do not delay if you may have an abscess.,
Go to your appointment and follow the dentist’s advice.,
Return to the dentist for follow-up treatment as needed.",How to Deal With a Sore Tooth2," While tooth pain can often be at least temporarily alleviated at home, permanently fixing a sore tooth frequently requires the intervention of a dentist.


Call a dentist if any of the following are true: your symptoms have lasted for two days; you have tooth pain accompanied by fever; you have signs of infection (swelling, redness, odor or discharge from the site); or you have trouble breathing or swallowing. If any of these symptoms are severe, even if they have lasted for less than two days, seek medical help immediately.If your tooth hurts when you're chewing, you might have a crack on your tooth. If it's above your gum, it can be treated with a root canal. If it's below the gum, your tooth may need to be extracted.
If you don’t have a regular dentist, call one in your area. If you have a toothache, you should be able to be seen within a couple of days.

, An abscess is an infection that has spread from a crack in the tooth into the pulp inside. From there, it can spread into the jaw and elsewhere, with possibly serious medical complications.In addition to pain, swelling, fever, redness in the gums, and a foul taste in the mouth can be signs of an abscess. Call a dentist if any of these symptoms accompany your sore tooth.
Seek medical attention immediately if you also experience any of the following symptoms: high fever, chills, vomiting, or dizziness. These can be signs of a severe dental abscess.In addition, seek immediate medical treatment if you experience an inability to open your mouth (if you can't fit one finger into it), difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, or gasping for air when you lay flat. These symptoms indicate that you might have a significant infection compromising your airway.

, Be ready to tell the dentist when your pain started, where the pain is most severe, and if you have any other symptoms.In addition to a visual inspection, the dentist may take x-rays, which can spot an abscess.
Take any and all medication prescribed by the dentist, according to his/her instructions. If you have an abscess, your dentist will probably prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection before the tooth can be fixed. Your dentist may also give you a prescription for a painkiller such as prescription strength acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or even hydrocodone.

, In the case of an abscess, the dentist will likely perform a root canal and crown. A root canal involves the removal of the infected pulp and the re-closure of the area in order to save the tooth.Root canals can be pricey, depending upon whether you have dental insurance, but they are not usually as painful as is often portrayed on television comedies, for instance.
Root canals can often take one to three office visits to complete. You will likely be fitted with a temporary crown after your root canal and need to return to the dentist for a permanent cap.
Your dentist might also give you the option of extraction, which is significantly less expensive.

Rewrite the complex fraction as a division problem.,
Take the reciprocal of the second fraction.,
Rewrite the expression as a single fraction.,
Simplify the expression.,
Complete the necessary multiplications.",How to Divide a Fractional Algebraic Expression by a Fractional Algebraic Expression (Using the Fractional Bar Form)1," Remember that a fraction bar means “divided by,” so when you see a fraction over a fraction, you need to divide the top fraction by the bottom fraction.For example, you might see 2x2y−3x4{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}}. You can rewrite this as 2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}.
;
, To  divide a fraction by a fraction, you take the reciprocal of the second fraction, and you change the division sign to a multiplication sign. A reciprocal is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are reversed.For example:2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}becomes2x2y−3×4x{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}}


, Use parentheses to show the multiplication, but do not multiply any terms yet. Writing the expression this way may help you identify terms that can cancel.

For example,2x2y−3×4x=4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}={\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}.


, Use the normal rules for  simplifying a rational expression to do this. Cancel out terms common to the numerator and denominator.Remember that you cannot cancel out a single term (like y{\displaystyle y}) from a binomial (like y−3{\displaystyle y-3}). 

Also remember that if you have an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term in the numerator, and an x{\displaystyle x} term in the denominator, you can cancel out one x{\displaystyle x}, and the x{\displaystyle x} in the denominator disappears, and the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} in the numerator becomes x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, you can cancel an x{\displaystyle x} in the numerator and denominator in the expression 4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}:4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{\cancel {2}})}{{\cancel {x}}(y-3)}}}4(2x)y−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}}


, If you have any remaining parentheses in the numerator or denominator, simplify these by multiplying. The result will be your final simplified expression.

For example, 4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}. So, 2x2y−3x4=4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}={\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}.

Be aware of the science behind your Basic Metabolic Rate (BMR).,
Factor in your age, weight, and gender.,
Determine how active you are on a weekly basis.,
Use your BMR and your fitness goals to determine your calorie intake.,
Create a diet based on your calorie intake.,
Record your calorie intake per a day.,
Update your BMR after several months of healthy eating and exercise.",How to Calculate Calories per Day," Your BMR is the estimated amount of calories your body burns when it is not moving, or at rest. This amount represents the minimum energy your body needs to function, from breathing to maintaining a heartbeat.You use about two-thirds of your daily calories to maintain your BMR, so the daily caloric intake needed to allow you to lose weight or gain weight (and still function as a person) will be based on your BMR.;
, Your BMR is based on your age, height, weight, and gender. Most calorie calculators use the Harris-Benedict equation to determine how many calories you should be eating every day.For men, your BMR is equal to: 65 + (6.2 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)
For women, your BMR is equal to: 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.3 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)

, Calorie calculators also factor in your level of activity. If you are very active, for example, with hard exercise almost every day of the week, you may need to consume more calories than if you lead a more sedentary lifestyle, where you do little to no activity. Be honest with yourself about your level of activity; many people over-estimate their daily activity level. The five different levels of activity are:Sedentary: You have a desk job where you sit all day long and do little to no exercise every week.
Lightly active: You do light exercise or play sports, one to three days a week.
Moderately active: You do moderate exercise or play sports, three to five days a week.
Very active: You do hard, intense exercise or play sports, six to seven days a week.
Extremely active: You do intense daily exercise or sports twice a day, and have a physical labor job or are doing a training camp for football or another contact sport.

, You can put all of the above information in calorie counting tool that will estimate your required calories per a day, based on your BMR, available here. Once you have your estimated calorie intake, consider how you will reduce or increase your calorie intake per a day based on your fitness goals.If you are trying to lose weight, reduce your estimated calorie intake by 500 per a day. Balance your fitness plan by eating 250 calories less a day and exercising enough to burn 250 calories. Try walking or running 2.5 miles a day. When planning your meals, cut back on portion sizes to reduce the amount of calories you consume by 250.
Remember that a pound of body fat is comprised of 3,500 calories, thus subtracting 500 calories per day over seven days will result in one pound weight loss per week.
If you are trying to gain weight, eat 500 calories more per day and limit your cardio exercises. Focus on strength training, involving free weights, to add lean muscle mass. You should also be eating at least one gram per pound of body weight of protein and get plenty of rest to recover after your workouts.
Always start by reducing or increasing your calorie intake a little at a time, no more than 500 calories either way. This will prevent your body from going into shock and ensure you are consuming enough calories to allow your body to function., Use your estimated BMR, minus or plus 500 calories based on your fitness goals, to create meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Always eat three meals a day, and balance out the protein, vegetables, and healthy fats on your plate to maintain a healthy diet.


For example, you might be a 28 year old female who weighs 140 pounds and is very active. You do intense exercise seven days a week, with one hour at the gym every other day and recreational soccer two days a week. Your estimated calorie intake, based on your BMR, is around 2050 a day. If you are looking to lose weight, you would remove 500 calories by subtracting 250 calories from your daily intake and burning 250 more calories during your exercise routine. You would now consume 1,800 calories a day and add more exercise to your existing routine to burn 250 extra calories.
It is very easy to overeat when following a limited diet, so it is important to create a meal plan and stick to it.
You could break down your 1,800 calories a day further into each meal, so 600 per a meal (600 x 3) or you could allot more calories for lunch and dinner and less calories for breakfast (500 for breakfast, 650 for lunch, and 650 for dinner).
Avoid under eating by consuming less than your estimated amount of calories, based on your fitness goal. This will lead to unhealthy weight loss and a lack of energy. It’s always better to burn off weight, rather than starve it off. You should also avoid overeating if your goal is to gain weight by building up muscle mass, as you will need the right amount of energy to get through your workouts., Start a food journal that charts your daily calorie intake, as well as the amount of exercise you are doing every week. Though you should not be too concerned about your weight on a scale, you should also note how much your weight fluctuates every week.


You can also download a calorie counting app on your phone so you can easily record your calorie intake for the day.After several weeks of healthy eating, based on a well estimated calorie intake, as well as exercise, you should start to notice changes in your body weight and your energy levels. Consuming enough calories to maintain your body’s functions and give you enough fuel to do daily exercise, means you will not end up losing or gaining weight in an unhealthy way.
Accountability is key. It is very easy to consume too much food in one sitting when you are not properly measuring and recording your foods for the day.

, Once you start to notice results, you may want to go back into a calorie calculator and adjust your BMR profile. Update the amount of exercise you are doing every week, as well as your total weight. Based on the calorie calculator results, you may need to reduce the number of calories you eat further or increase the number of calories you consume every week.

Express love and concern.,
Avoid blame or guilt-tripping.,
State things in a calm and assertive fashion.,

Get law enforcement involved under certain circumstances.,
Cut ties from the family member if your health and well-being is threatened.,
Keep your medication in a safe space.,
Care for yourself.",How to Confront Family About Stealing Your Medication," Oftentimes, addiction is the culprit if someone is stealing your medication. Your family member may have an addiction to prescription pain medication. If this is the case, spend some time learning about addiction. This will help you foster empathy and best address the situation.Read about addiction online. There are many resources you can use, such as Narcotics Anonymous, that provide information about what addiction is. Try to remember addiction is a medical condition and your family member cannot help being drawn to the substance.
If you're currently seeing a therapist, you could try asking your therapist for more information about addiction and talk over confronting the family member with them.
Remember, while addiction is one possible reason your family member took your medication, it is not the only explanation. A family member may also be stealing to sell the drugs for money. If you find your family member does not display symptoms of addiction, look for another explanation.
You may even want to connect with a local rehabilitation center to talk with a drug counselor about your situation and get some advice about how best to proceed.;
, You do not need to write out what you're going to say word for word. However, it can be helpful to have a rough idea of what you want to express going into the conversation.Jot down your feelings for a few minutes. Pull out a few phrases that best convey your feelings and concerns. You can have these in the back of your mind going into the conversation.
You do not need to write down an entire script for yourself. In fact, doing so can make the conversation worse. You may sound disconnected when speaking to your family member, which is not something you want during a hard conversation.

, It's vital you talk to your family member at the right time. A poorly planned confrontation can give your family member a chance to evade or escape the conversation.As this is a sensitive subject, choose a place that's private. You can try confronting the family member when they're at your house, for example, or go to their place to talk.
Make sure there are no external constraints. You do not want to begin the conversation only to have your family member run to work. Choose a time when they're not distracted and will be more receptive to your words.

, You do not know how your family member will react. Trying to predict as much can affect how you approach the conversation. If you, for example, expect a bad reaction, you may come into the conversation angry or overly confrontational. Try to approach the conversation without any particular expectation about what will occur.Remember, no matter how well you know someone, you can never entirely predict their reactions. This is especially true with difficult issues.
There is no way to predict the future or someone's behavior. Therefore, go into the conversation reminding yourself you do not know what is going to occur.

, With addiction, you need to approach the topic from a place of love. You want your family member to feel supported, not alienated, by you. Ultimately, your goal should be to get them the help they need so they do not steal from you again.You are probably angry and hurt by your family member. It is okay to express this, as your family member needs to know their addiction hurts others. However, remember your family member likely feels guilt and shame on their own end. Come at it from a place of love.
For example, do not say, ""I'm furious that you took my medication."" Instead, say something like, ""I love and care about you. I'm angry you took my medication, but I'm also concerned by the behavior. I'm worried you have an addiction.""

, Blame-oriented language can make the person feel guilty. While your family member should take responsibility for treating their addiction, a physical addiction itself is largely beyond someone's control. You do not want to say things that sound like you're blaming the person. This will only increase negative feelings and make your loved one less likely to seek help.It can be helpful to use ""I""-statements here, as they are designed to reduce blame. They start with ""I feel..."", after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, you state the actions that led to those feelings, and explain why you feel the way you do.
For example, ""I feel hurt that you took my medication without asking because it's a huge betrayal of my trust.""

, Getting angry in these situations, no matter how emotionally taxing they are, will make things worse. Remember, you want to help your family member confront their addiction and get help. It's best to remain calm to achieve this.Addicts may try to confuse you or deflect blame. They may even deny wrongdoing at first. Be calm and continue to state your case.
For example, your family member says, ""Maybe you took more than you intended and didn't realize."" Respond with something like, ""Please do not lie to me. We need to talk this over.""

, You want to end the conversation on a note that allows you both to move forward. Talk to your family member about seeking treatment for addiction. This is vital if your family member has been stealing medication.End the conversation with something like, ""I think we should get you treatment so this does not happen again. I love and care about you and I just don't want you getting hurt.""
Remember to keep your expectations in check. Your loved one might not be willing to make a change right away. They might need some time to think and want to return to the conversation later.

, The first step to moving forward is making sure your family member gets the treatment they need to overcome their addiction. Explore your options here. It's probably a good idea to enlist the help of other family members.There are many different options regarding treatment. Some treatments have patients stay in a facility, while other treatments only have out patient care.
You can go to a local hospital or drug rehabilitation facility about possible treatment.
The treatment you choose depends on the severity of the addiction and what you and your family can afford.

, Unfortunately, a confrontation may not always work. The problem may continue, despite your efforts to help, and in these scenarios you may need the help of law enforcement.If your family member starts to commit bigger crimes, such as picking up prescriptions for you or using your credit card to buy drugs, you should report them to the authorities. You do not want your credit and identity damaged by someone else.
Also, if you feel like you, your loved one, or anyone else is in danger at any time, then do not hesitate to call emergency services or to call your local police.
While it is always painful to get law enforcement involved with a loved one, this may be the wake up call your family member needs.

, You need your medication for your physical health and well-being. If your family member is continuing to take your medication after the confrontation, your health and safety is at risk. You should cut ties with the family member at this point. This can be painful, but you need to prioritize your health., As you need your medication for health reasons, do your part to make sure it does not get stolen again. Find a safe and secure place to keep the medication away from the family member who stole it.


Keep your medication somewhere with a lock that's difficult to reach. You could, for example, keep your medication in a safe over a cabinet. Just make sure the medication is accessible to you at all times.When choosing a secure spot for your medication, read the instruction labels that come with it. Some medication cannot be stored at certain temperatures, for example, or needs to be out of direct sunlight.
You may also want to lock up any valuables that your loved one might try to sell for money to buy drugs.

, It's never easy to confront a family member about such a painful topic. In the aftermath of the confrontation, prioritize self-care.Do things to take your mind off the situation, like reading a book or watching a movie. Make time for any hobbies you enjoy.
Spend time with kind and supportive friends and family members.
Consider looking for a support group, like Al-Anon, to help you out.

Sweetspot to recover onto a ledge.",How to Play Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee3," When being knocked away, side-B will give Marth a bit of time to stay in the air. When you are close enough to the side of the stage, then press Up-B. If you are close enough to the side of the stage and your enemy is trying to ""Hedgehog,"" the attack will sometimes hit him. You can even side-B more than once if you time it correctly, allowing you to cover vast distances to make difficult recoveries.

, Down-B is used as a counter, and is one of Marth's most helpful attacks. Use it when you are being barraged by attacks and cannot escape. You will take no damage from that attack, and then use a sword strike to knock away enemies.


Avoid countering repeatedly, as most players will catch on quickly and fake you out, leaving you open.

, This is done by delaying the timing of Dolphin Blade (Up-B) so that you grab the ledge as late as possible, making yourself less vulnerable as you recover. This can be countered by edge-hogging though, so be careful.

Remember to eat regular meals.,
Ask for help.,
Have healthy snacks on hand.,
Set realistic expectations.",How to Eat Healthy As a New Mom1," You may feel any sense of routine you had is gone once you bring home a baby. It can be difficult to even remember to sit down and eat when you've been up caring for the baby. Remind yourself that you need to be eating regular meals throughout the day. This will give you steady energy. Eating regular meals will also stop you from making poor food decisions on an empty stomach.If you need to, set an alarm on your phone that reminds you when it's time to eat a meal.
If you have help, have someone care for the baby while you sit down for a meal.;
, Friends and family members often want to help when a new baby comes. A great way they can help is to bring you meals. There are several meal sharing applications or programs, so your friends and family can organize which date and when they want to drop off food. Just let them know that you'd prefer healthy food.


For example, don't be afraid to request no junk food, cookies, or fried foods. Many apps also have a place for you to list any dietary restrictions.

, Since you'll be up throughout the night and be busy caring for your baby during the day, you'll probably find that you're hungrier than usual. This is especially true if you're breastfeeding. Try to have nutritious snacks that you can eat with one hand. If you can, portion them into serving sizes. Some good examples of snacks include:Cut fresh fruit with a yogurt dip
Granola bars
Hard boiled eggs
Cut vegetables and hummus or bean dip

, Talk with your doctor about a reasonable calorie-intake during the postpartum period. One of the perks of breastfeeding is that you'll actually need about 500 more calories a day, so your body can produce milk (for a total of 2200 to 2400 calories a day). If you're not breastfeeding, you'll probably need to get between 1900 and 2200 calories a day.Avoid cutting too many calories in the early postpartum period, since your body needs a chance to recover from childbirth.

Hold unpopular views on political and social issues.,
Question popular and common beliefs.,
Know that some conformity is normal.,
Think of rebellion as a movement, not just an attitude.,
Put your own spin on the rules or on common behavior.,
Speak your mind, especially when others are afraid to.,
Do what you want to do, not what people expect from you.,
Dress outrageously.,
Shrug off people's negative opinions about you.,
Stand up for your beliefs and for people who share them.,
Pick your battles wisely.,
Know the difference between rebellion and recklessness.,
Remember that your actions always have consequences.",How to Be a Rebel," A central part of being a rebel is to develop views that go against popular, traditional views.


Musical rebels like Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur based much of their work and philosophies on fighting the establishment, defying expectations of their peers, and acting the opposite of others' expectations.They did what they felt, said what they believed, and didn't care about what others thought.
The United States and other free countries were founded on unpopular beliefs. In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, interracial marriage was deemed illegal in certain states.Segregated marriage was a popular belief and is now considered wrong. The people who fought against it are now credited as being upholders of freedom and thinkers who were ahead of their time.
Remember that ""popular"" is relative. People at your school may believe partying and doing drugs is the popular social norm. Defy this norm by being clean and proudly advertising that to others.;
, Part of holding unpopular views is to question things that most people believe at face value.


The French scientist Georges Cuvier tried to convince people that African-Americans were not as smart as Caucasians because of their skull shape and size.His student, Friedrich Tiedemann, questioned this theory and showed that there was no scientific evidence to support this commonly accepted ""truth.""Questioning your beliefs and the beliefs of others is difficult, but rewarding work. Remember that accepting things at face value is common among people because it is the easiest.When you question things, you will naturally stand out from the pack because the act of questioning tends to be rare.
Questioning things isn't just a way to stand out, it is a way to arrive at the truth. When you question things that turn out to be true, you will be held in high regard by your peers. Most people in the 16th century believed that the Earth was flat. Pythagoras, the person who proved the opposite, is now revered in both science and mathematics., You don't have to be completely different from everyone around you to be a rebel. Following trends is part of being human, and actually helps us navigate everyday life.


Musicians like Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur are credited as being some of the most rebellious artists in their respective genres. Still, they tended to dress and behave in ways that were similar to their peers.
Most people aren't even aware of when they are conforming.Following others is a natural process, but that doesn't mean that you can't consciously notice when you are following others and decide to do otherwise.
You might notice that on the path to being a rebel, you'll find that there are others who share and believe in similar views. This isn't uncommon, and is often the way movements and revolutions start.

, Being a rebel involves taking physical action, not just holding and believing in unpopular views.


Even if you're determined to be a rebel without a cause, you will need to show others that you're your own person.
You don't have to hurt other people's feelings or say outlandish things to be a rebel. Being a rebel simply means displaying behaviors that are uncommon or unpopular.
For example, it may be popular and common for your peers to play football and wear letterman jackets on campus. Do the opposite by wearing torn jeans and obscure band t-shirts.

, You don't necessarily have to break the rules to be a rebel. All you have to do is act in a way that stands out from what's common.


For example, if you play sports and have a letterman jacket, stand out from your athletic peers by removing the sleeves of your letterman and wearing it like a vest.
If you are required to call teachers proper names like ""Mr. Moser"" or ""Mrs. LaGuerta,"" put a playful spin on it by calling them ""Mr. Most-definitely"" or ""Mrs. L.""
If your school requires you to wear a school uniform, like a nice pair of pants and a collared shirt, throw some personality into your wardrobe by leaving your shirt untucked. Or, you could tuck your shirt into nice pants with holes at the knees.
If your peers tend to walk slowly while looking down at their phones, grab some attention by skipping through the hallways on campus. Strut proudly, sing a song while skipping, swing your arms like a gorilla. People tend to remember things that are unusual or difficult to understand., Speaking your mind doesn't mean just blurting out whatever you are thinking at a given moment. It means advocating for your opinions and beliefs, especially on issues you feel strongly about.


You may feel that your cafeteria is severely lacking in yummy foods like burgers and tacos. Tell the school administration that they should include more foods that teenagers enjoy.
If you can't rally up people to present your case, do it by yourself. Having numbers may be a powerful way of showing people that you mean business, but it isn't the only way. As long as you provide solid evidence for your beliefs, you should be fine (for example, good tasting foods help learning because they increase serotonin levels, and high serotonin is essential for memory).If your school is hosting a poetry slam, write some spoken word about how the cafeteria food sucks. Paint a picture of foods that you want to eat at school, and hang it on people's lockers. Sing a song during lunch about people's choice of what to put in their bodies. Art is a great way of getting people to see the merits of your views and expressing yourself in creative ways.

, Doing what's in your heart may possibly be at the ultimate core of what it means to be a rebel.


If you feel an uncontrollable urge to dance, join the dance squad or dance feverishly in the quad during lunchtime. If you like to argue with people about their beliefs, join the debate team and pick people apart in a structured manner. Rebelling isn't just about using your voice, it's about using your body.
Find something you are truly passionate about and align your actions with that passion. If you hate animal cruelty, picket the lunch line for hamburgers with signs of cute baby cows. Rebels with a specific cause tend to be the most prominent and memorable., Making a spectacle of yourself is a great way to make people do a double-take. Dare to grab hold of people's attention from everyday, mundane routines.


Outrageous is subjective. If your school tends to have multiple people who sport mohawks and ripped jeans, dress in a rock/preppy fashion. Wear a long sleeved collared shirt with the sleeves ripped off. Wear dress slacks with holes in them. Wear a tie that is loose and extremely loud.
Rebellion is all about contradiction. If you can create contradiction within your wardrobe, people might notice you even more. For example, wear a mohawk but also wear thick framed glasses. Wear a pair of worn sneakers with a business skirt. Throw a nice blazer over a Black Sabbath t-shirt and jeans.
Sport accessories that are strange but relevant to your personality. If you love teddy bears, have a teddy bear key-chain on your keys but dye the fur your favorite colors. Dye your hair blue to match your outfit. Don't be afraid to clash and look ""weird"" to others.

, Focus on ""doing you,"" not on pleasing others.


It will be common for people to mock and tease you for being different. Though you shouldn't lay down and accept their cruelty, you should also not take any of what they say to heart. People tend to fear things that are strange or different.If you find yourself being mocked and teased for being unusual, flaunt what makes you weird and embrace it. Write ""weird"" or ""strange"" on a t-shirt and wear it to school. When people see that those words don't affect you, they'll know they don't have any power over you and will find calling you those names useless.
If people call you really hurtful or offensive things, tell a school administrator. The reason people tease others is to ""get them in line,"" and is probably a remnant of the evolutionary behavior to regulate the group.Still, you shouldn't have to experience hurtful things for wanting to be different.

, Shrugging off ridicule is a great trait to have, but knowing when to advocate for yourself and others is also very critical.


Don't let people tease you for being different. You don't have to fight them physically or verbally. A simple ""leave me alone, I'm not hurting anybody"" is enough.
Teachers may tell you to act, dress, or behave a certain way because it is ""part of the rules."" If it truly is part of the rules, you may be better off following them. If your teacher is simply telling to behave a certain way because it is the norm, tell your teacher that you're not breaking any rules.
If you see someone who looks, acts, and believes the things you do, ally yourself with them. Rebels don't have to be lone wolves. Having a friend with similar beliefs and attitudes is a great way to expand on what makes you a rebel and come up with rebellious ways to express yourself.

, You don't have to fight the school administration over cafeteria items. Maybe freedoms of expression, like the right to wear certain band t-shirts or play certain music, is a more valued issue.


If doing a certain action - like questioning your teacher when she tells you to tuck in your shirt - means getting sent to the principal's office and possibly getting expelled, choose whether or not you believe enough in that action to bear the consequences.
Fight for issues that matter the most to you. You may be a fan of Led Zeppelin, but maybe being a vegetarian is more important. Forego your plea for ""rock music during lunchtime"" for ""more menu alternatives other than meat.""

, If your actions have a possibility of seriously hurting yourself or others, avoid doing them. Rebellion is about standing out; you don't need to do harmful things to do so.


It's normal for teenagers to be curious and to experiment. If you truly are curious and want to experiment with alcohol, drugs, or sex, be safe and cautious. Know that you don't have to do these things in order to be thought of as a rebel.
Remember that being a rebel means fighting conformity. Within your rebellious group, you may still face peer pressure to experiment with drugs or alcohol. If that is something you truly don't feel comfortable doing, don't do it. Tell your friends that you're ""being an even bigger rebel"" by not following them.
Some people think that being a rebel means damaging or vandalizing property. You don't have to be infamous in order to be a rebel. If you want to express yourself visually, decorate your own property with spray paint, stickers, and permanent markers.

, If being a rebel to you means constantly disobeying rules and fighting with other students, know that there are other consequences besides being ""known"" as a rebel.


You don't have to be violent and unruly to be a rebel. Sure, you can talk tough and walk with your chin up, but you don't have to harm people to be noticed. Being a rebel is about being original, and demeaning others to gain popularity is too common among many people.
Decide whether being expelled and losing an opportunity at an education is really worth being a rebel. Many political rebels like Tupac, Malcolm X, and Gandhi were focused on getting an education as a form of rebellion.As the old saying goes, ""knowledge is power,"" and being a rebel is about showing individual power.

Understand that confrontation isn’t about starting a fight, it’s about addressing and resolving issues that are causing tension.It is important to identify the REAL issue that is inciting this confrontation. People tend to project emotions or moods onto other people or other situations. Before you decide to confront someone, take the time to parse out what the issue is that you want to approach and why you feel like a face-to-face confrontation is the best way to go about resolving this issue.;
, Try to separate your feelings about the issue you want to talk about from other confounding situations or emotions that aren’t relevant to the discussion at hand.When you do finally have your confrontation, the only statements you should make are ones that are directly relevant to the issue that spurred your confrontation.


Separate problems from emotions.For example, are you upset because your coworker forgot to turn in a report and caused you an extra 6 hours of work on a Friday evening? Or are you upset because you got stuck with extra work that you won’t get credit for?
Don’t bring up any issues or vendettas from the past. Past actions or feelings that are not directly related to the issue at hand have no place in your confrontation. Don’t start to throw in other frustrations that you’ve kept bottled up.

, You will want to explain to the person what happened, what you heard, what they did, etc. that you want to talk about. You will also want to explain why you feel the need to talk about it, and how it made you feel. Here is an example of how you may want to frame your confrontation using “I statements”:“I heard from one of our colleagues that you told our boss I didn’t put in my fair share of work on the project.” (What you heard)
“I feel like I worked really hard and I’m really confused as to why you said this.” (Why you want to talk about it)
“I’m hurt that you would say this to a superior behind my back.” (How it made you feel)

, You want to make sure you say everything that’s on your mind in a logical and composed way, and this can be hard to do without some prior preparation. Writing your thoughts out on paper before your confrontation can help you to ensure you say everything you want to say to the other person.


Rehearsing the main points that you want to make during your confrontation can make you feel more comfortable and prepared for the actual confrontation event. Start by rehearsing alone in a room while looking in a mirror. If you have someone that you trust, you may want to practice in front of them as well.
Try to memorize your main points. This will be much more effective than reading from a piece of paper during your confrontation.

, While sometimes we lash out at a person when we feel anger, we generally shy away from planned and controlled confrontation. However, controlled confirmation can be a positive and effective way to deal with a problematic issue or person. It is important, however, to ensure that you are mentally ready for your confrontation- you want to feel calm and ready to have a discussion.


Determine if you still feel anger toward the person or about the issue you want to discuss. If you still feel anger, it is likely not the best time to have a constructive confrontation. Postpone your confrontation until your anger subsides and you can have a rational, factual, and emotion-free conversation.The angrier you are, the more likely that your conversation will turn into an argument.
Go into your confrontation with a calm demeanor and focus on having a productive discussion, not a fight.

, Picture yourself coming to some sort of agreement or finding a resolution: this is the goal of your confrontation. Remember that confrontation often does have positive effects.


Deciding the outcome that you want from your confrontation can help you move the conversation productively., While confrontation is uncomfortable, awkward, and difficult, it can also be a rewarding experience. The benefits from confrontation can improve your own emotional state as well as your relationships with others.


Confrontation can release you from the burden or tension of a situation.If there is something that has been weighing on your mind, confronting the issue head-on is a great way to relieve yourself from this unnecessary stressor.
Confrontation encourages honesty in a relationship. You learn more about yourself than you would otherwise, and you gain the confidence to express the way you honestly feel.In addition to encouraging honesty in a relationship, confrontation usually strengthens a relationship., While it can be tempting to confront someone through a phone call or via text or email, it should be avoided if at all possible.Talking face-to-face is a much more powerful way to resolve an issue efficiently and effectively. Try the following approaches for proposing a meeting to engage in a constructive confrontation:


“Elise, I notice that we seem to be butting heads a lot when we meet as a group for our school project. Can we sit down and talk about our different views and see if we can find a way to collaborate so that this project gets done?”
“Paul, it would be great to have the opportunity to talk about how we communicate with each other. Would you be able to find time this afternoon to sit down and have this conversation?”

, Keep your confrontation calm, composed, and collected. It is usually best to confront someone with a few brief, factual, succinct statements.

r]]

Say what you need to say, but try not to blame the other person.For example, “I was upset when you gave a presentation to our boss and didn’t mention the contributions I made” instead of “You never give me recognition for any of my work.”

, Reciting what you have prepared (see “Part 1 of 2: Preparing to Confront Someone”) will help you present your issue in the best possible way.


Don’t throw insults or call names, and stay away from inflammatory comments.This is a sure-fire way to guarantee that your point is not heard or respected. Maintaining as much professionalism as possible during a confrontation will lead to a more positive outcome.

, A productive conversation depends on both parties alternating between contributing and listening. Even if you don’t agree with what is being said, it is necessary to listen to the counterpoint when you are confronting someone.


This is true for every type of conversation, but is especially important in a tricky social interaction like a confrontation.
Try to be emotionally non-threatening.Stick to the facts that support your side of the confrontation and don’t allow emotions to get involved.

, People often will get defensive when they are confronted as it is not a pleasant feeling to be attacked.Even if you feel that the points you are making are well-supported and you are presenting them in a logical and non-insulting way, it is still very likely that the person who you are confronting will put their guard up and get defensive.


The best way to handle a defensive person is to listen to them. While you may not agree with the point they are making, you should give them the chance to speak their mind.
Try to avoid arguing. It is easy to argue with someone who is getting defensive; however, it is undoubtedly unproductive. Try your best to keep a calm and collected demeanor instead.

, You confronted the person for a reason, and it is important that you stick to your guns even if they are disagreeing with you or acting defensively. Point out that this is not meant to start a fight, but it’s an issue that you feel needs to be dealt with head-on. If you are armed with facts and examples and present these with composure and clarity, your point should be heard.


Keep in mind that your opinion matters, and being able to speak honestly is worth engaging in an uncomfortable social interaction., Consider the “Rule of 3”- if someone performs a behavior (such as “forgetting” their wallet, not responding to an email, etc.) three times, it is likely a behavioral trend and is probably worth a confrontation., If the person you are considering confronting is causing problems in a wider arena (such as in the workplace, within the family, etc.), the situation may only be resolved through confrontation. In particular, workplace confrontations can be particularly difficult.


If you feel like someone is taking advantage of you, or intentionally undermining you, it may be worthwhile to confront the person. If you are worried about confronting the person in private due to fear of the issue escalating, you may want to contact your human resources (HR) department and explain the issue to them.
When confronting a co-worker, it is especially critical to be armed with facts. These facts should support your side of the issue you want to discuss. For example, you might mention specific days that your colleague came to work late or particular presentations that you feel he or she did not contribute sufficiently to.

, If a person’s behavior poses a threat to him or herself and/or anyone around them, it is recommended to confront the person in order to stop the behavior from repeating or escalating.


Assess the unique situation. If you feel unsafe confronting someone on your own, you might need to bring a trusted friend with you or have the confrontation in a public place. Put your own safety first.

, There are definitely situations that will benefit from direct confrontation; however this is not universally true. There is no need to confront everyone, every time. Sometimes, a smile and basic “okay,” or simply walking away from the issue is a better way to resolve tension than staging a confrontation. Because each situation and each individual is different, it is important to determine if confrontation is the right way to handle things on a case-by-case basis.

Have your vet check your cat’s blood pressure regularly.,
Have your vet perform a urine test.,
Schedule a blood test for your cat to rule out other conditions.,
Talk to your vet about having a kidney biopsy done.",How to Know if Your Cat Has Kidney Issues2," Cats with kidney disease have a tendency to develop high blood pressure. Unfortunately, unless your cat's blood pressure is checked regularly by your veterinarian, you may not be aware there is a problem with her blood pressure, so it is a good idea to have her checked regularly.Sadly, high blood pressure can cause serious side effects, like sudden blindness and strokes. Luckily, if your vet checks your cat’s blood pressure regularly, he or she will be able to prescribe medication that can control your cat’s blood pressure.

, If your veterinarian is suspicious your cat has renal issues, he or she may request a urine sample. This sample is tested for specific gravity (SG) which is a measure of how weak or strong the urine is.Along with a urine test, a dipstick test rules out other causes of thirst such as diabetes mellitus.
A further urine test called a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC) helps distinguish dilute urine that is due to renal disease from other causes such as behaviorally driven thirst.

, Blood tests have a useful place in monitoring the progress of renal disease. Unfortunately, a normal blood panel does not mean the renal function is normal. This is because the kidney has a large reserve capacity and the kidney has to be more than 75% damaged before it will show any signs through a blood test.The main use of blood tests is to rule out other causes of increased thirst, such as infection, diabetes, or an overactive thyroid gland, and to monitor ongoing renal disease.

, Kidney biopsies are rarely performed because they can have serious and dangerous side effects, like blood clots and strokes. However, biopsy is important if renal cancer is suspected, because a definitive diagnosis can help decide if chemotherapy is an option or not.

Choose the badger shaving brush according to your needs and budget.",How to Care for a Badger Shaving Brush1," While the cleaning methods provided in this article are appropriate for each type of brush, it is helpful to understand the way in which badger shaving brushes are ""graded"" (noting, however, that there is no standard naming convention, so name variations are given here):


Pure badger, or dark badger (standard) - the hair used here is derived from the stomach, shoulders, neck, and buttocks of the badger. This hair is usually very dark and it is coarser than other types of badger brush. Brushes made from this hair tend to be machine assembled, and they are the most affordable version of the badger shaving brush range.Gray badger, standard, pure - this hair is taken from the tail and back of the badger. It is lighter, almost gray. Again, this version tends to be machine assembled.
Premium badger, finest, tapered, or best badger - this hair is taken from the back of the badger and the color band varies from light, to dark band, to light again. The tips of the hairs are thinner than the base and this makes them soft. This version is usually assembled by hand and is expensive. It is thought to be best for light beards.
Silver tips/silver-tip badger, sometimes referred to as ""super"", (although that can mean it is slightly inferior to the silver-tip) - this type of brush uses only neck hair that lightens during winter, making it very expensive.It is white, with a small dark band. It is very soft and is suitable for men with skin conditions.;

, Turn the jug upside down and cut out a rectangle, leaving an edge all around.

, Cut the holes out on the sides and top only, using a SoniCrafter or whatever you have that will cut through tough plastic.


Cut off the top 2/3, leaving the bottom 1/3 to attach your bottle/cup to.






At this point, score along the bottom, so that the flap can be bent inward.







, Use the miter saw to cut off the top of the bottle. (If you are using plastic cups, you can skip this step).

, Set the half bottles/cups in the holes of the planter. The top of the ""pot"" should be just a little above the top of the hole, just so that it doesn't slip inside. Cut off any excess bottle/cup.

, Drill a hole a little smaller than the screw through each bottle/cup half bottom, and the flap on each hole. Screw each cup to each flap.

, Measure the space between the top of the holes to the bottom of the ""pots"" and cut a scrap piece of board to fit in and use as a wedge to keep the pots up against the planter. Caulk around the outside edges of each ""pot"", sides and bottom. Add the caulk to the sides of each ""pot"" on the inside.

Speak with your doctor before ingesting essential oils.,
Ask about enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules.,
Take peppermint oil only when necessary.,
Take the capsules an hour before each meal.,
Swallow the capsules with water.,
Do not take peppermint oil with other medications.,
Consider peppermint tea instead of peppermint oil.,
Do not take essential oils regularly.,
Be aware of risks specific to peppermint oil.,
Watch out for side effects or allergic reactions.,
Reduce alcohol consumption while taking peppermint oil.",How to Take Peppermint Oil," In general, ingesting essential oils such as peppermint oil is not recommended. While the practice is employed in some parts of the world, essential oils are unsafe to consume without professional medical guidance., The menthol in peppermint may provide relief from the symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort caused by irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. In order to do so, however, the capsule must make it to your intestines without breaking down.An enteric coating will help capsules pass through the stomach without breaking down.
Enteric coating will also help reduce potential heartburn, which can be a side effect of taking peppermint oil capsules.

, As soon as you start experiencing symptoms of IBS, which may last for days at a time, take a capsule. Start with one at a time to see if this is enough. Take the capsules daily, for as long as digestive discomfort is bothering you.If symptoms persist after taking one capsule, take two capsules before your next meal. Never take more than three capsules at one time.
If you forget to take a dose, don’t double up later. Simply resume the dosage that has been working.

, Similarly, avoid taking the capsules immediately before or after a meal. Taking a capsule with a meal can disrupt your digestion and prevent the capsule from helping., The capsules will come with information on how to take them, including things like how much water you should drink, and liquids you should avoid taking with the capsules. The important thing is to swallow the capsules whole, without chewing or breaking them in any way., Other indigestion medications, including antacids such as Tums, may interfere with your peppermint oil capsules and prevent them from working. Accordingly, avoid taking any other medications or herbal remedies for two hours preceding of following each dose.If your symptoms persist, a treatment option other than peppermint oil may work better for you.

, Peppermint teas is not only refreshing, it can help reduce some mild symptoms of indigestion. For instance, if you are experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort, peppermint tea may help. Get peppermint tea from your local grocery store or health food store or make your own.To make your own, use 1-2 teaspoons of dried, ground peppermint leaves per cup of water. Boil the water first, then add the leaves once the water settles and let sit for 10-15 minutes.
Peppermint tea will lose effectiveness in treating upset stomach if used habitually. Only use it when you have discomfort in the mid or upper portion of your belly.

, Stated simply, essential oils can be toxic to the liver or kidneys if taken in unsafe quantities. Similarly, natural processes within your body may change the effect of the essential oils, and the oils may also interact negatively with medications, either suddenly or after extended use., Do not take peppermint oil if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Do not take it if you’re experiencing intense constipation, have passed blood in recent stools, or are experiencing irregular vaginal bleeding. Additional factors that may put you at risk include:Loss of appetite or recent weight loss.
Illness.
Difficulty urinating.
An allergy to menthol, peanuts, or soya.

, Most commonly, peppermint oil can cause heartburn, stomach indigestion, and a surprisingly burning in your backside. These side effects may subside once your body acclimates to the capsules. However, if any of these symptoms become especially bothersome, discontinue use of peppermint capsules and mention the side effects to your doctor.Though uncommon, signs of peppermint allergy include rash, headache, feelings of shakiness or unsteadiness, and a slow heartbeat. If you experience these or any other unexpected effects, notify your doctor.

, Alcohol consumption may increase the likelihood that you will experience side effects. It may also prevent peppermint oil from helping ease indigestion."

Apply lip balm.,
Increase your water intake.,
Use a humidifier.,
Monitor your medications.,
Take a multivitamin.",How to Heal a Split Lip3," After your lip has healed, buy a non-medicated, beeswax-based, unflavored lip balm and apply it frequently. It’s even better if the balm contains lanolin or petroleum. Some lip balms even have an SPF rating and can help protect your lips from dryness caused by sun exposure.Don’t use lip balm from a pot as it can lead to infection due to bacteria., To keep your entire body hydrated, and avoid cracked and split lips, drink at least eight glasses of water per day. To promote healing of a split lip, boosting your water intake up by a few glasses might even help., Wintery and cold weather can create dry conditions that will cause your lips to crack. These cracks can then turn into deep splits. To counter this pattern, use a humidifier in your room at night. Or, install a humidistat device on your interior heating and cooling system.This is especially a good idea if you are a known mouth-sleeper, which can dry out your lips even more., If you suffer from continue split lips, it could be that your medications are to blame. Read all of the warning labels for your meds, looking for any cautions against dryness. If you see something that concerns you, talk with your doctor about medication alternatives.For example, some acne medications dry up the moisture and oils on your entire face, including your lips.

, Split lips are often a sign of a vitamin deficiency. To counter this problem, take a quality multivitamin each day that contains iron and zinc. B9 (folate) and other B vitamins can also promote skin healing. Try out a few different vitamin combinations, with the guidance of your doctor, to see what works the best for you."

Pick a music genre.,
Do your research.,
Ask people.,
Browse.,
Find what you like.,
Get to know your local bands!",How to Find Awesome Music (for Scene Kids)," If you only know one or two genres, you won't have as wide a variety of music to choose from - and you won't know much about music. Do some research, and pick one or two genres that you think you'll probably like. Always remember to experiment; you never know when you might come across something great! These are the typical Scene Kid genres:


Alternative Rock and Pop Punk
Glam Rock and Metal

Skate Punk, Electronic Punk Rock
Metalcore, Deathcore, Hair Metal
Indie
Techno, Dance, Trance, Posicore (Positive Hardcore), Crunkcore, Electronica/Electro,Dubstep, Nightcore;
, The more you know about these types of music, the more likely you are to find something really great. You may look at a genre name and think nothing of it, but it might be just the type of music for you. Select a few genres and do some research on them - find out their history, style, popular artists and bands, etc.

, If your friends are into the Scene, ask them to recommend you a couple of bands or singers. Don't be shy or embarrassed - you may discover some really great music. If you know anyone else who might know some music you might like, ask them who their favourite singers or bands are.

, When you're hanging around in the mall with some spare time, step into a good music store. Check out the different genre sections and look around; you may find something that you really like or would like to try out. You may want to look at genres that you know you like, or just pick at random. Don't be afraid to experiment and try something new - you won't get anywhere otherwise!

, If you're really into a certain singer or band, try finding someone who is a little like them; for example: if you really like a certain artist, try listening to someone who's voice or style is a little like theirs. You may find another great artist or band that you haven't discovered before. Try some online music recommendation sites like last.fm.com or ilike.com. they will take what you listen to and try to find similar artists.

, Find underground bands, so you know them before they get famous, and go to local shows, even if you have no idea who is playing. Go with your scene friends to any other shows. Seeing bands play before they are really famous is a great way to actually get to know and talk with the band members personally - who knows, if you wanted to get into playing guitar or bass, they might be able to give you a few pointers!

Observe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",How to Know if You Have an Anxiety Disorder," Anxiety is often associated with feelings of fear and worry. These feelings of fear and worry can lead to different behaviors. Alongside fear and worry, some other emotional symptoms include:Feeling irritable and restless
Feeling tense, jumpy
Feeling apprehensive or dreading
Expecting the worst to happen
Loss of concentration, mind going “blank”;
, Along with emotional symptoms, anxiety often involves some physical symptoms. Many people with anxiety disorder experience certain physical symptoms on a daily or almost daily basis. These symptoms may include:Racing heart
Sweaty hands
Stomach upset, nausea
Frequent urination or diarrhea
Tense muscles
Headaches
Shortness of breath
Twitches or tremors

, Anxiety can make you behave in different ways. You might avoid certain situations due to the anxiety they can bring.This can include work, home, school, or social situations. This kind of avoidance can get in the way of living a normal life.


You may find yourself purposefully avoiding social situations, such as parties or outings with your friends.

, Having an anxiety disorder means that the symptoms of anxiety may affect your life in negative ways and decrease your functioning. This can include problems at work, school, home, or in social situations that result from anxiety. For example, you might lose so many points from missing class due to your anxiety that you end up failing a class.


You may also notice that you cannot control your fears or worry and that they get in the way of living a normal life.For example, you may find it hard to sleep or focus on an important task because you are so worried about an upcoming test.

, Ask your friends and family members whether they notice any signs or symptoms of anxiety. Sometimes other people can give you accurate feedback on your behavior and explain the situations in which they notice your anxiety. Ask people close to you who observe your behavior regularly. Family members can answer honestly and respond to symptoms you’ve shown since you were a child.


This kind of feedback can be helpful if you lack awareness to when you feel anxiety or what situations bring on your anxiety.

, People with anxiety disorder have ongoing symptoms. To be diagnosed with anxiety disorder, your symptoms must have been present for more than six months and they must have occurred on most days during this time period., Make an appointment with a psychologist or therapist to discuss a diagnosis of anxiety. Certain medical professionals are qualified to diagnose anxiety, such as psychiatrists, psychologists and some physicians who are well-trained in mental health diagnosis. Try asking your general practitioner for a referral to someone who can give you a diagnosis. You may be given a psychological evaluation, which can include answering questions about your symptoms, thoughts, behaviors, moods, and feelings and filling out a questionnaire.Once you have a diagnosis, this can be a huge relief. You now have the awareness to bring healing and improved health to your life.

, You may want to rule out certain diagnoses or medication interactions, which is why it can be helpful to meet your general practitioner. Talk about your symptoms with your physician. You may be given a physical exam or have some lab tests taken.Be sure to discuss any medications you use, in addition to any supplements, vitamins, or herbs you take.
Discuss any substances you’ve used recently and regular alcohol consumption or tobacco use, as well as caffeine consumption.

, If you do have an anxiety diagnosis, it’s best to start treatment right away. The faster you address your anxiety disorder, the better you can begin to feel. Many people choose to attend therapy as a primary way of addressing symptoms. Cognitive-behavior therapy is a technique that helps you think and act differently by challenging irrational beliefs that have a basis in fear and negative thought patterns and replacing them with more positive thoughts.Your therapist may teach you certain relaxation methods which can help calm anxiety, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Practice relaxation and calming activities regularly to buffer stress and anxiety.

, Everybody has worries from time to time. Generalized anxiety disorder affects you long-term and anxiety is experienced in various situations and not around one specific event. You might worry about many things, and spend much of your day worrying. Despite efforts to stop, you cannot seem to get your mind off of your worries. With GAD, worry and anxiety are part of every day and can cause physical and emotional symptoms on a regular basis.Your worrying may distract you from things you need to do, or you may constantly feel like something bad will inevitably happen. You may not know why you feel so worried.For more information, check out How to Reduce Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

, It’s normal to feel nervous before a date or presentation. However, some people have such intense fears around social events that it causes harm to their lives. If you have social anxiety disorder, you may tend to have intense fears about talking to people, being in large groups, or giving speeches or presentations. Social anxiety can occur when meeting new people, speaking up in a group, or feeling like the center of attention. You may feel like all eyes are on you or that people are waiting for you to make a mistake to judge you or your performance.Activities such as talking on the telephone or eating and drinking in public may fill you with fear.You may tend to avoid social situations, such as parties and gatherings to the point that it disrupts life.
Some symptoms of social anxiety include intense fear prior to social situations, turning red or feeling nauseous around other people, feeling dizzy, and trembling or shaking.
If you’d like to know more, read How to Recognize Social Anxiety Disorder.

, Panic disorder is when you experience a surge of worry accompanied by startling physical symptoms. Some people report feeling like they are having a heart attack, despite being in good health.You may start to breathe shallowly, sweat, feel like you are choking, feel dizzy, or fear you are losing control or going crazy.You may begin to fear having panic attacks and even the thought of having a panic attack brings intense worry. You may change your behavior in order to avoid feeling a panic attack again.


Panic attacks tend to peak at 10 minutes and rarely last more than 30 minutes.
To learn more about panic attacks, check out How to Manage Anxiety and Panic Disorder.

, If you have OCD, you may experience obsessions (“Did I leave the door unlocked? Are my hands clean enough?”) and compulsions (“I better check and re-check the locks. I need to wash my hands again in order to feel clean.”) Obsessions are repeated thoughts that cause anxiety. The compulsions are performed in order to reduce the anxiety. Obsessive thoughts can include violent or “bad” thoughts, such as wanting to kill yourself or someone else, despite being a calm and harmonious person. These thoughts can lead to intense distress and anxiety, yet those with OCD cannot stop thinking them.Once the compulsion is completed, the person experiences some feeling of relief, yet does not experience pleasure from the compulsion. Often the thoughts and compulsions begin again, which can feel frustrating and like the person is trapped.


If you have OCD, you likely spend an hour or more engaged in compulsions each day. OCD majorly impacts your life and day-to-day functioning.
For more information, check out How to Know if You Have OCD.

, Phobias are over-exaggerated fears that do not present an immediate threat in reality. Some people have intense fears around snakes or spiders or hurricanes, despite living in an area with few threats. If you have a phobia, you may go to extreme measures to avoid contact with the phobia. This kind of behavior only perpetuates the fear and can increase it.While it’s normal to have a fear of heights, if you have a phobia, you likely will refuse to do activities that may feel threatening, even if it’s only a perceived threat.
If you’d like to know more, read How to Overcome Phobia.

, PTSD occurs after experiencing a traumatic or stressful event. It’s normal to experience distress during and after a trauma, yet some people carry on this feeling of distress long after the event has occurred. You may experience flashbacks or dreams of the event, scary thoughts, or avoid certain places, people, or objects. To be diagnosed with PTSD, you must have symptoms for one month or more that include re-experiencing the trauma, avoiding triggers, having altered thoughts or feelings related to the trauma, and heightened reactivity.For example, if you have PTSD after a car crash, you may avoid driving in a car or being near cars due to the intense fear they bring about.

Check to see if you need a building permit.,
Choose a location for your hot tub.,
Prep the site, if necessary.,
Call a general contractor if you decide to place your tub on a deck or build a deck to accommodate the tub.,
Create a route for the power to reach the hot tub.,
Plan your delivery route of the tub from the curb to the foundation.,
Assemble the hot tub and hook up the electricity.,
Prepare the hot tub for use.,
Know that some warranties will be voided if the electrical circuit isn't installed by an electrical contractor.,
If you decide to do the wiring yourself, keep the power on a single dedicated circuit.,
If wiring on your own, make sure your specs are right.,
If you have any doubts, use the services of a professional.",How to Install a Hot Tub," Many cities will require building permits for installing hot tubs outdoors.Check with yours to see if you need to as well.;
, Make sure the spot you choose is large enough for the hot tub as well as some extra leeway for getting in and out and performing maintenance. A safe amount to allot is approximately 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m), but it depends on the size of your hot tub.


Examine your city's building code to ascertain how far away from your home you must place your hot tub. Many codes require at least 5 feet (1.5 m) of clearance between your home and your property line.
Two other regulations you need to consider when finding a place for the hot tub. The hot tub should be at least 10 feet (3 m) away from any overhead power lines, as well as 5 feet (1.5 m) removed from the spa panel.Water and electricity do not mix.

, Hot tubs, when full, can weigh as much as 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg). For this reason, you will need a firm foundation on which the hot tub can rest. If you don't have a firm foundation, you risk damaging the tub voiding any warranty it comes with.


Pouring concrete into a 3 to 4 inch thick (7.62 to 10.16 cm) pad is a common method of creating a solid foundation. Concrete provides a very strong foundation. At the same time, it may not be aesthetically pleasing and will be permanently anchored into place if you ever choose to move the hot tub.
Another option is prefabricated spa pads. These pads have interlocking grids that make installation easy, and they can be removed if you ever decide to relocate your tub. At the same time, spa pads may be less supportive than concrete.Make sure you have a solid base to work with, and you choose the strongest pads if you use this option.

, If you want to place your tub onto a deck, check first with a contractor. They should be uniquely suited to tell you whether the deck will be able to withstand a ton or more of weight bearing down on it like a continuous hammer. The last thing you want to have happen is to break your deck, and then your tub, upon installation.

, Most modern tubs are self-contained, meaning you won't have to run any plumbing in order to get the tub up and running. But electrical wiring is another matter. Cities usually have codes for using certain types of conduits, so make sure you talk with your local building department. When you have, decide if you'd like the conduit to run under or above ground.


Most pumps will require an extra hard-wired circuit, one that's entirely dedicated to the electrical on the tub. A 240V, 50-amp GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) should be sufficient on many tubs. Multiple-pump tubs may require a 60-amp circuit. If you don't have familiarity wiring this kind of circuit, it's best to call an electrician to do it for you.

, An unfilled hot tub can weigh upwards of 800 pounds (363 kg), so it's important to know how you will get it from the delivery van to your backyard. Make sure that the width of the tub will pass through any gates, foliage, or structures with enough leeway.


Some delivery drivers will help you with this step.
If you find that the tub is bigger than certain obstacles in your path will allow, you may need to improvise. Cutting a branch or removing a part of a fence, although it appears drastic, is sometimes the only thing that you can do.

, The voltage of a hot tub is higher (usually around 240 volts) than regular home outlets, so you will need to install a breaker to your electrical control box. If you are not familiar with electrical systems, it is best to hire an electrician to assist you in this aspect of installation. See the section below for more information on electrical wiring and help.

, You're almost ready to start enjoying your brand new tub, without having broken the bank by paying someone else to install it. To complete the installation, you'll want to:


Turn off the electricity.
Clean the interior of the hot tub and make sure all jets and knobs are in place.
Open the air valves.
Fill the hot tub with water from a garden hose or using buckets of water from inside. No special water is necessarily required.
Turn the electricity back on and begin heating the tub.
Mix in the proper chemicals to ensure sanitation.

, In some cases, unless the circuit has been installed by a licensed contractor and then approved by a local building/electrical inspector, the manufacturer won't recognize the warranty.

, The power that runs the hot tub must be given a dedicated circuit because of its electrical demands. No other appliances or electrical demands should share the power.

, Again, if there is any doubt about how to wire the circuit responsible for the hot tub, use a licensed electrician. Otherwise, here is some important information about wiring that you should know:


The size of the wire you use must be approved by the National Electrical Code (NEC)and/or local codes.
The size of the wire you use should be based on the length of run from the breaker box to the hot tub. The maximum current draw should also play a role in determining wire size.
Copper wire is recommended with THHN (thermoplastic nylon) insulation. In fact, all wiring should be copper; aluminum wire should be avoided.
If using wire larger than #6 (10mm2), be sure to put a junction box close the hot tub. Then, reduce the wire to short lengths of #6 (10mm2) in between the junction box and the hot tub.

, When it comes down to it, saving a few hundred extra bucks isn't worth the potential disaster of voiding the warranty or causing serious bodily harm or death. Please see a professional if you no experience wiring electrical circuits.

Form-flattering clothes are the way to go.,
You don't need designer clothing or whatever is cool.,
Look for good deals, and if you really want designer clothes, but can't afford them, buy knock-offs.,
Keep the clothes age-appropriate.,
Don't wear the same outfits all the time; mix and match!

,
Wear things that work well together.,
Accessorise!,
Wash your clothes when you're done wearing them; if your clothes look dirty, or haven't been washed in a while, then it gives you a sloppy look.

,
Wear clothes that fit.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Even if you have no interest in fashion whatsoever, try to wear nice clothes.,
Make sure your clothes look good on you.",How to Look Great (Girls)7," Highlight your best features, but don't wear anything revealing. Remember that black makes you look slimmer, and horizontal stripes make you appear to be wider.

, If you have something that fits well, looks good on you, and that you like, then that's good enough.

, If you outgrow something, or don't like it, then sell it! You can get money to buy something that you like, fits and looks nice!

, No teddy bear skirts if you're 13, for example, and no see-through clothes if you're 10.

,, If your clothes are clashing, it's distracting and doesn't look good.

, Purses, jewelry, scarves, whatever you want, as long as it matches!

,, Anything too tight or baggy isn't particularly form-flattering.

, No jeans to a funeral, and no fancy dresses to school. Your shoes should match the ""theme"" of your outfit as well. For example, no snow boots with skirts.

, Nothing with stains or holes, or anything old and dirty!

, If you look terrible in yellow, don't buy a bright yellow shirt. Ask someone for their honest opinion on how the piece of clothing looks on you before you buy it.

Mention where you're from.,
If appropriate, mention how old you are.,
Introduce other people with you.,
Ask a few basic questions.",How to Introduce Yourself in French2," This is one of the most common questions asked among people meeting for the first time. Since you're not a French speaker, the person you're talking to will probably be even more interested to learn your origins. Use one of the phrases below:



J'habite à ______ (I live in ______): Zhah-beet ah (location)


Je vis à ______ (I live in ______): Zhuh veez ah (location)


Je suis de ______ (I'm from ______): Zhuh swee duh (location)

Put the name of your city, state, or country in the blank. For example, if you're from the U.S. you might say, ""Je suis des États-Unis.""

, This isn't always a topic of conversation that will come up, but if you're a young person meeting people who are older than you, it's nice to know how to say. Use the easy phrase below:



J'ai ___ ans (I'm ___ years old): Zheh (number) ahn. The final n is very delicate — more or less silent.
Put the number of years old you are in the blank. See our guide to counting in French for help.

, Being able to introduce other people is almost as important as being able to introduce yourself — especially if they're not great French speakers. Use the phrases below to make introductions between people you know and people you don't:Je vous présente ______ (I present you ______): Zhuh voo preh-zont (name and/or title)


Voici ______ (Here is ______): Vwuh-see (name and/or title)

After you say someone's name, you may want to describe your relationship with this person in a few words. For instance, you might say ""Voici Emma, ma femme"" (""Here is Emma, my wife"").

, Once introductions are out of the way, the conversation itself can commence. Below are just a few basic questions you may want to have ready — you don't need to be perfectly fluent to show you're interested in learning more about the person you're meeting.



Comment vous appelez-vous? (What is your name?): Co-mahnt vooz ah-play-voo?


D'où êtes-vous ? (Where are you from?): Doo eht-voo?Quel est votre profession? (What do you do for a living?): Kell ay vote-ruh pro-fess-yone?


Comment allez-vous? (How are you?): Co-mahnt ah-lay-voo?

Determine whether this person is already in a relationship.,
Be confident, but prepared for rejection.,
Find out what he or she likes, if possible.,
Determine how you want to ask the person out.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Ask them if they would like to go on a date.,
Let them know that there are no hard feelings if they say no.,
Make eye contact and smile at the person.,
Approach the person and introduce yourself, if you haven't already.,
Strike up a casual conversation.,
Ask the person out.,
Be diplomatic if they say no.",How to Ask Someone Out," This will save you a great deal of embarrassment and unnecessary effort.


Don't ask somebody out if they are in a relationship. Not only is it essentially guaranteed that they'll say no, but it is inappropriate, unfair to the person's boyfriend/girlfriend, and reflects poorly on your moral character.;
, Decide beforehand what you will do or say if the person says no. This is especially important if you plan on asking out a friend, as it will reduce the likelihood of damaging the friendship.


Being prepared for rejection will help you avoid appearing physically defeated in front of the other person if the answer is no.
While you want to prepare yourself for the possibility of rejection, don't let it get in the way of your confidence. Rather, let it build on your confidence by accepting the fact that being rejected isn't the end of the world.

, This will help you think of a good idea for a date. If this person loves music, find out what kind and invite them to a concert. If they enjoy movies, then invite them to the theater, and so on.

, If you are too shy to do the asking in person, then consider sending a text, Facebook message, or email.


Text messages are a good option if you are too afraid to do the asking in person. This way, you will at least be able to hide your disappointment from the other person.
If you have just met the person and don't have their number, you will have to do the asking in person, but don't fret! Doing the asking in person is romantic and can be very rewarding if the person says yes.

, Starting a casual conversation first will help you ease your way into asking the question and reduce some of the nervousness you might feel.


Send a friendly text saying ""Hey, how's it going?"" If you are doing the asking in person, approach the person and say hello. Make sure to smile and make eye contact, as this will show that you are interested.
Instead of asking them out right away, first ask them what they are doing tomorrow, this coming weekend, and so on. This will serve as a segue to asking the person out and will make the conversation flow more naturally.

, Suggest an activity that you think they will be interested in, based on what you know about the person. If you can't think of anything, here are a few ideas:


Ask them to meet for coffee or a drink.
Ask them out on a dinner or lunch date.
Ask them if they'd like to come to a party/dance with you.
Ask them out for ice cream or frozen yogurt.

, This will help eliminate any awkwardness in the future, especially if you have just asked out a close friend that you plan on continuing to see on a regular basis. More importantly, it will show the person that you are confident and mature enough to handle a little rejection.

, This shows the person that you are interested in them, and gives them the opportunity to return the gesture, showing that they too are interested.


If the person looks away or doesn't smile back, they might not be interested. However, it might also mean that they are too shy to reciprocate, so don't give up quite yet.

, Be sure to act confident, even if you are shaking inside. First impressions are very important, and confidence is an attractive characteristic in both men and women.

, This can range from complimenting the person, to talking about what's going on in the room around you, or asking them a question. If you can't think of a reason to talk to the person, try these things:


Ask the person what time it is.
Ask the person where they are from.
Ask the person what they are reading.
Compliment what the person is wearing.
Talk about the music that is playing, or anything else that is going on around you.

, Once the conversation has started, let the person know that you think they are interesting, and would like to get to know them.


Suggest meeting for coffee, lunch, dinner, etc. These are all very basic dates that are low-commitment, in case you don't hit it off.
Avoid asking them out to a movie on the first date, because it will not give you a chance to get to know one another.

, If the person says no, smile and say something like: ""Well, it was worth a try. Nice to meet you anyway!"" and then leave them be. Don't continue to bother the person once they have said no, and definitely don't continue trying to convince them to go out with you. This will make you appear desperate, and make the other person feel uncomfortable.

Find the wattage on the appliance label.,
Multiply wattage by hours used each day.,
Divide the result by 1,000.,
Multiply your answer by the number of days you're measuring.,
Multiply by the cost of electricity per kWh.",How to Calculate Kilowatt Hours2," Most high-power appliances have an energy label on the back or base of the appliance. Look here to find the wattage, listed as ""W."" This is usually the maximum power the device operates at, which may be much higher than the actual average wattage.The steps below will find a rough estimate of kWh from this number, but your actual kWh usage is usually lower.


Some devices show a range of watts, such as ""200–300W."" It may be more accurate to choose the middle of this range, or 250W in this example.

, Watts measure power, or energy used over time. Multiplying by a unit of time gives you an answer in terms of energy, which is what matters for your electrical bill.



Example: A large window fan rated at 250 watts runs for an average of 5 hours a day. The fan's daily watt-hours equal (250 watts) x (5 hours / day) = 1250 watt-hours per day.
For air conditioning and heating units, make separate calculations for each season.
Refrigerators only draw power about ⅓ of the time, or about 8 hours a day if you never unplug them., A kilowatt is equivalent to 1,000 watts, so this step converts your answer from watt hours into kilowatt hours.



Example: You've calculated that your fan uses 1250 watt hours of energy per day. (1250 watt hours / day) ÷ (1000 watts / 1 kilowatt) = 1.25 kilowatt hours per day.

, Now you know how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) the device uses every day. To calculate your kWH per month or per year, just multiply by the number of days in that period.



Example: Over the course of a 30-day month, your fan would use (1.25 kWh / day) x (30 days / month) = 37.5 kWh per month.

Example: If you fan runs every day for a year, it would use (1.25 kWh / day) x (365 days / year) = 456.25 kWh per year.

, Your electricity bill lists the cost per kilowatt hour. Multiply this number by the kWh to find the amount you can expect to pay.



Example: If energy costs 17 cents/kWh, running the fan will cost (0.17 dollars / kWh) x (456.25 kWh / year) = $77.56 per year (rounded to the nearest cent).
Remember that estimates based on the listed wattage is a maximum. In reality you would be charged less than this.
If you're looking at a different area than the one you live in, search online to find the cost of electricity. For US locations, start with the EIA website.

Remember if you have the pads with the long flaps which are visible when you get changed, cut them off to make them unnoticeable.,
Say if in PE you have to wear a large jumper for sports, put that on first so it will cover the top of your legs and hide any noticeable parts of the pads.

,
Consider using a tampon if you know you'll be changing in front of other girls and don't want them to notice you're wearing a pad.,
Go into a toilet cubicle to change!,
Note that if you really don't feel like doing PE, get your mother to write you a note to get you out of it.",How to Get Changed for Physical Education with a Period," If you want to keep the wings, try wearing underwear the same colour as the pads so they're camouflaged.;
,, Tampons are not as noticeable through your underwear as a pad (and they stay in place better during sports)

, If anyone asks, say you had to use the bathroom, too.

, Just don't do it every month, people might catch on.

Look for “no salt added” canned vegetables.,
Buy sodium-free sauces.,
Choose dry beans.,
Buy whole grains.,
Use caution with condiments.",How to Cut Salt from Pantry Foods1," Canned vegetables are generally high in sodium. To cut the salt from these, buy canned vegetables that say “no salt added” on the label. That ensures you are getting the vegetable without added salt.If you want a little bit of salt to taste, you can add a small amount of salt when you put the food on the plate.
Consider cooking your vegetables with spices and herbs to eliminate the need for added salt. For example, try adding rosemary and thyme to green beans or ginger and sage to carrots.;
, Many sauces, such as pasta sauces, have a lot of added sodium. Most brands offer a sodium free option. If you can’t find sodium free, you may find a reduced sodium option.Make sure to check the serving size. Reduced sodium varieties may not be low in sodium if the serving size is smaller than what you would eat.

, Canned beans are full of unnecessary salt. However, beans are a really healthy food. To get away from this, try dried beans. This will give you the benefits without added sodium.Dried beans take longer to cook, so cook enough for multiple servings for the week.

, Many grain items may be full of sodium and other unhealthy additives, especially if you buy flavored varieties. Replace these sodium-heavy versions with plain, whole grains that are relatively salt free.For example, instant oatmeal not only contains added sodium, but sugar as well. Plain, steel cut oats are a healthier option.
When buying cereal, look for brands that have whole grains as the first ingredient. Make sure to buy a brand with a low sodium content.
Try whole grain pasta, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, and bulgur.

, Condiments are pantry staples, but they can be loaded with salt. Read the labels carefully and compare brands and types before buying. If available, get a reduced sodium, low-sodium, or no-sodium added variety.Condiments may include ketchup, mustard, dressing, olives, pickles, relish, dips, and soy sauce.
Consider leaving the condiments off your food completely.

Speak about matters of life and death.,
Learn how to greet people in Costa Rica.,
Talk about liveliness.,
Make comments about your life.,
Add common exclamations and interjections to your vocabulary.",How to Say Life in Spanish3," There are many common phrases in Spanish that incorporate the word vida to indicate the importance or gravity of a situation. In Spanish as in English, you may fight for your life (debatía entra la vida y la muerte), lay down your life (dar la vida) or lose your life (perder la vida).If something awful or difficult has happened, but you want to communicate that the troubled times will pass and you will move on, you might say ""la vida sigue"" (""life goes on""). If the awful thing has never happened to you before, you might say ""en mi vida"" (""never in my life"").
If something is a matter of life and death, it is ""cosa de vida o muerte."" If a desperate situation requires you to risk life and limb then it requires you jugarse la vida.
Not all phrases about life use the word vida. For example, if you wanted to tell someone in Spanish that they gave you the fright of your life, you would say ""¡Qué gusto me diste!""

, You may already know that ""¿Como estas?"" means ""how are you?"" in Spanish, and you may know to respond ""Bien, gracias"" to mean ""I'm well, thank you."" But Costa Ricans use a different phrase as a greeting that incorporates the word vida.If you are in Costa Rica, you'll hear people use the phrase ""pura vida."" While the direct translation of this phrase is ""pure life,"" the use of the phrase goes far beyond the direct translation. More accurately, it describes a relaxed lifestyle that values happiness and joy.
You might hear the phrase in other Central American countries as well, but it's most common in Costa Rica. There, the phrase is used as a general greeting, as well as the response to that greeting.
It also is used as a general expression of gratitude or satisfaction. For example, if you say ""¡Muchas gracias!"" someone might respond ""Pura vida!"" by which they mean something more like ""you're welcome.""
In English, you might ask someone ""how's life?"" instead of saying ""how are you?"" or a similar greeting – especially if you haven't seen the person in awhile. In Spanish, you would say ""¿Qué talk te va?"" or ""¿Cómo va eso?"" Not these phrases do not include the word vida., In English, there are many phrases incorporating the word life to talk about how something seems real, or how a person brought life to a place or event that was dead or dull before they arrived. Spanish has similar phrases, though not all of them use the word vida.Many of these phrases use the verb animarse, which means ""to come to life."" For example, if you want to say that a particular guest brought the party to life, you would say ""animó la fiesta."" If that person was the life and soul of the party, you would say ""el alma de la fiesta.""
Perhaps you're having trouble with the office printer, and you want to say in Spanish that the machine seems to have a life of its own. You would use the phrase ""tener vida propia"" (which means ""to have a life of its own"").

, Particularly when you're speaking to someone you haven't seen in awhile, they may ask after your life in general. You can respond in equally generic terms by using common phrases in Spanish.For example, if you want to tell someone that you have a good life, you might say ""es una vida agradable"" (""it's a good life"") or ""la vida me ha tratado bien"" (""I've had a good life"").
In contrast, if you wanted to say that you've been having difficulties, you might say ""la vida es muy dura"" (""it's a hard life"").
If you want to tell your significant other that they are the love of your life, you would say ""eres el amor de mi vida"" (""you are the love of my life"").

, There are many phrases using the word ""life"" in English, such as ""that's life,"" that can be used to express how you feel about something happening. In Spanish, there are similar phrases that mean the same thing, even though the translation isn't always literal.To say something similar to ""that's life!"" or ""such is life!"" in Spanish, you would say ""¡así es la vida!""
If you want to tell someone to get a life, you would say ¡espabílate y haz algo!""

Interject ""¡Dios mío!"" if something has happened that you find shocking or upsetting. A literal translation would be ""My God!"" but as used, the phrase means something like ""my life!""
If someone asks you to do something that you have no intention of doing, you might say ""¡ni hablar!"" which means ""not on your life!""

, You need to see a doctor who will find ways to treat you which do not involve overpriced medications which you may not need.

, Don’t hesitate to ask for a sample that you have a prescription for. Every little bit helps. However, keep in mind that the samples will be given mainly for expensive drugs. In many cases, cheap alternatives are available, and drug companies do not give free samples for drugs on which they don't stand to make a large profit.

, Meijer even offers some for free. Shopping online can also save up to twenty percent.

, Ask your doctor if he can prescribe your drug in a higher dosage so that you can cut your pills in half. This way you will get a double amount of dosages for the same price. However, not all pills can be split in this manner. Gel capsules and time release capsules cannot be split.

, Call hospitals and doctors offices before you show up for a procedure, and get the details of what the facility is going to charge you. This knowledge may help in negotiation of a better deal or to motivate you to search for a more affordable practitioner. At the very least, your doctor will be more price conscious if she knows that her patients are asking questions.

, Always ask the price before getting work. Once you learn the price, explain that you have no insurance and you would like to have a discount.

, Doctors are running to make a profit for their practice. Some more so than others. If a doctor is recommending extra tests or procedures, especially ones not covered by insurance, get a second opinion to see if these are necessary.

Spray the solution on the slippers and let them dry completely – usually for one day – before wearing them again.Be sure to spray the slippers outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.

, Since Ugg slippers can be slightly difficult to clean at times, it’s important to take proper care when storing them when you aren’t wearing them. Try to keep your Ugg slippers in a clean place away from any dust or dirt accumulation – like in a closet or drawer.


Because of the suede material, you don’t want to keep them in a damp place that could ruin the fabric over time. Keep your Ugg slippers in a dry place instead of somewhere where moisture could reach them – like the bathroom or garage.

, Ugg slippers are mainly intended for indoor use around the house. Even though they have a hard sole, you should try to avoid wearing them outside – especially in areas that are particularly dirty.Try not to track your Ugg slippers through mud or other inclement weather that could damage or permanently stain your slippers.

Schedule errands and chores.,
Set aside three hours of decluttering per month.,
Use the one-minute rule.,
Do a five-minute clean up at the end of the day.",How to Beat Clutter if You Have ADHD1," People with ADHD are often easily distracted, and are prone to forgetfulness and procrastination. It's possible to overcome these roadblocks to decluttering if you make — and follow — a schedule for your errands and chores. Use a day planner, wall calendar, post-its, reminders on your phone — whatever works best for you. Pick a date and a time to drop off your dry cleaning, and write it down. Schedule things like yard work, laundry, paying bills, or anything else that tends to pile up or contribute to clutter., Schedule three hours to tackle all of the disorder in your home on a monthly basis. Given the challenges of distraction with ADHD, it is important to actually set aside the time to take control of the clutter in your life. Once you begin doing the monthly straightening out, you may pay more attention to organizing on a daily basis so that the monthly declutter is easier.You may want to choose an evening when you are alone. After organizing, you may feel more able to invite people into your space.If you feel overwhelmed by the clutter as a result of your ADHD, consider asking a close friend or family member for help.If you find it too hard during the week, you may want to choose a weekend afternoon.
If the mood to declutter strikes before your scheduled organization time, that's fine! If you feel driven to declutter, get down to it.

, Always do chores if they take less than a minute. Instead of leaving the dishes from your lunch meal for later in the day, just do them right away. Anything that takes less than a minute should be done right away.If there is a pile of coats that need to be placed on a hanger, just do it right away instead of leaving it for later.

, At the end of your day, walk around your house and look for things to clean up. When you see an article of clothing or a book that is out of place, put it away. Clean up as much as you can in five minutes. If you feel you are easily distracted as a result of your ADHD, spending just five minutes on organization can be a good way to go."

Check with the management of your office and determine if any holiday festivities have been scheduled.,
Ask permission to schedule a potluck at the office and coordinate the best time and location to set up and have the meal.,
Pick a date and time.,
Ask the highest ranking manager to send an email to all employees asking them to save the date and time and inviting them to celebrate with co-workers.,
Post signs around the office with the date and time.,
Create a sign up sheet for people to commit to bringing certain items.

,
Tape the sign up sheet to someone's desk in a central location.,
Include another sheet with the details of the event and a separate sheet for a few volunteers to sign up.,
Include a deadline to sign up and remove the sheet at the deadline.,
Consider the following categories and layout to add to your sign up sheet(s).,
Remind everyone to bring the appropriate serving spoons to serve their dish.,
Tell them to drop off their dishes.,
Set up large garbage cans to collect dirty dishes and cups.,
Remind everyone to label their dishes, slow cookers or serving items.,
Make sure you have dish detergent at a sink where people may rinse off items before taking home.,

,
Give everyone plenty of time to go through and eat.,
Remind everyone to claim their dishes and serving items.,
Wipe down the tables, move drinks and non-perishable items to the break room for people to enjoy later.",How to Plan a Holiday Potluck for Your Workplace," Even if an off-site holiday party is scheduled, an in-house potluck may allow more people to attend.;
,


Depending on when your offices are open, a lunchtime potluck meal may be the best time. More employees are typically in the office during the day.
Ask your manager if the company can cover the cost of the meat items, allowing employees to bring the fixings. If not, ask everyone to contribute a dollar or two in addition to their potluck contribution. Order the meats in advance from a restaurant, grocer, deli, etc.
Because of the cost involved and concerns about proper cooking, you may want to consider ordering hams or turkeys from a local restaurant, grocer or deli. You can pick them up before the meal and serve while it is still warm. The meats usually take the longest time and having them prepared by a professional is usually easiest. Consider ordering pre-cut turkey breasts and ham to offer a variety with easy serving.
Tofurky or other meat substitutes should also be available for any vegetarians or those with food ""issues"" who attend. Don't assume they'll be fine with the side dishes either. Vegetarian dishes are quick to prepare and are good menu items for vegetarian co-workers to sign up to bring. Add a ""meat substitute"" line to your sign up sheet if vegetarians are numerous in your workplace.

, Consider the demands of your industry. Retail businesses may need to schedule this when the location is less busy. Other offices may have many people taking their vacation the week of Christmas. Consider a time earlier in the month of December if your office tends to operate on a skeleton crew the week of Christmas.

, Reminder emails should be sent out weekly leading up to the date.


Send the initial email out as far in advance as possible. Two weeks in advance is adequate for smaller offices.
A message from the most senior manager is usually best and will probably result in a better turn out.
Managers can coordinate a system with their staffers to allow everyone a chance to get food and eat.

, Also instruct people to a specific location to sign up to bring certain dishes. Place the sign up sheet in a central location where people will see it every day.

,, You don't want the sign up mixed up or accidentally thrown away.

, Volunteers will be needed to set up the food, put ice in coolers, etc. For a larger workplace, you may want to have a sign up sheet for ""Set Up Volunteers"" and ""Clean Up Volunteers"".


Consider the size of your office when adding the numbered lines. If you only have 20 people in your office, you may want to only put a few lines under each food category.
By limiting the number of items under each category you can be sure you will have enough of the appropriate food items and not 5,000 paper plates and bags of ice but nothing to eat.

, This will encourage people to sign up the weeks before and not for something at 6pm the night before. One or two business days before is usually sufficient.

, Other items may be considered depending on what may be popular locally. Adjust for the size of your office. Have them write their name and what they are bringing. (Example: John Doe - Candied Yams)

, People bringing desserts should bring pie servers or a sharp knife. Let them know on the sign up sheet and through emails and memos to bring the appropriate serving spoons to go with their dish. People bringing canned foods (cranberry sauce) may need to bring a manual can opener if your office kitchen or break area doesn't have one.

, Include a notation on the sign up sheet asking everyone to bring their dishes to the area/room it will be served at least 30-45 minutes prior to the mealtime. Those with non-perishables can place them in the room as they arrive in the morning. This will get all the food and serving ware into the right room where the volunteers can set it up.


Also include a notation that everyone is responsible for collecting their dirty dishes following the potluck.

, This will prevent food dishes from being tossed into waste paper baskets that may not have liners. You may need to move the garbage cans from other parts of the building or coordinate with the cleaning service to have the large cans and heavy duty liners available.


If your office and staff is working to be more ""green"" you should request specific environmentally friendly plates, cups and cutlery be purchased. Make sure you have a separate recycling container next to the trash.
To stay super green, ask everyone to bring their own plates, cups and utensils from home.

, Keep a roll of masking tape in the drop off area in case someone forgets.

, If a sink is not available, people may want to bring a plastic bag to safely transport the dirty dishes back home for cleaning.

, Having everyone with hot dishes trying to warm food in the microwave could be problematic and delay the start time of your meal.


Electric griddles are an excellent way to keep items warm when you use them on the lowest setting, monitor often and stir as needed.
Some potluck recipes are excellent when served in a slow cooker. They are easy to transport and you can be plugged in when you arrive at the office so the food stays warm.
Have tables set up near plugs to keep slow cookers and other electric serving items can be plugged in.

,


Wipe off any tables that will be used for serving food.
Set the plates, cutlery and napkins at the beginning of the food line, place the meats next followed by the side dishes. Place drinks and desserts and the end of the table or set up another table for those items.
If the dish isn't obvious, the dish bringer should label the dish with the name of the food and note if there are nuts, or meats in it. Just ""Veggie casserole - has nuts"" or ""pasta salad - has become"" will do. The mention of nuts is especially important if someone in your office has a nut allergy. The mention of meat is nice for vegetarians, especially when a meat or broth may be mixed in and not obvious at first glance. Label the dish or tape the note to it. Taping the note to the table may not work since dishes may get moved around as people are serving themselves.

, This is usually best as people are gathering but before everyone has served themselves and is moving to find a seat. If you have someone who can say a few words giving thanks, coordinate with them before. They can be ready to make those remarks as the manager finishes.

, These may be co-workers who have duties that are being temporarily covered by someone else.

,, Encourage people to get seconds or save leftovers on plates for any shift workers that may not be awake to attend. Label these and put in the refrigerator. They'll love the thought.

, Hopefully, most people will come to collect those items and the volunteers won't be delivering bowls and platters to offices.

, Put any tables or chairs back in place. Make an announcement asking for any volunteers to help with clean up. With several people it can be done in a matter of minutes.

Determine your experiment's expected results.,
Determine your experiment's observed results.,
Determine your experiment's degrees of freedom.,
Compare expected results to observed results with chi square.,
Choose a significance level.,
Use a chi square distribution table to approximate your p-value.,
Decide whether to reject or keep your null hypothesis.",How to Calculate P Value," Usually, when scientists conduct an experiment and observe the results, they have an idea of what ""normal"" or ""typical"" results will look like beforehand. This can be based on past experimental results, trusted sets of observational data, scientific literature, and/or other sources. For your experiment, determine your expected results and express them as a number.


Example: Let's say prior studies have shown that, nationally, speeding tickets are given more often to red cars than they are to blue cars. Let's say the average results nationally show a 2:1 preference for red cars. We want to find out whether or not the police in our town also demonstrate this bias by analyzing speeding tickets given by our town's police. If we take a random pool of 150 speeding tickets given to either red or blue cars in our town, we would expect 100 to be for red cars and 50 to be for blue cars if our town's police force gives tickets according to the national bias.;
, Now that you've determined your expected values, you can conduct your experiment and find your actual (or ""observed"") values. Again, express these results as numbers. If we manipulate some experimental condition and the observed results differ from this expected results, two possibilities are possible: either this happened by chance, or our manipulation of experimental variables caused the difference. The purpose of finding a p-value is basically to determine whether the observed results differ from the expected results to such a degree that the ""null hypothesis"" - the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the experimental variable(s) and the observed results - is unlikely enough to reject


Example: Let's say that, in our town, we randomly selected 150 speeding tickets which were given to either red or blue cars. We found that 90 tickets were for red cars and 60 were for blue cars. These differ from our expected results of 100 and 50, respectively. Did our experimental manipulation (in this case, changing the source of our data from a national one to a local one) cause this change in results, or are our town's police as biased as the national average suggests, and we're just observing a chance variation? A p value will help us determine this.

, Degrees of freedom are a measure the amount of variability involved in the research, which is determined by the number of categories you are examining. The equation for degrees of freedom is Degrees of freedom = n-1, where ""n"" is the number of categories or variables being analyzed in your experiment.


Example: Our experiment has two categories of results: one for red cars and one for blue cars. Thus, in our experiment, we have 2-1 = 1 degree of freedom. If we had compared red, blue, and green cars, we would have 2 degrees of freedom, and so on.

, Chi square(written ""x2"") is a numerical value that measures the difference between an experiment's expected and observed values. The equation for chi square is: x2 = Σ((o-e)2/e), where ""o"" is the observed value and ""e"" is the expected value.Sum the results of this equation for all possible outcomes (see below).


Note that this equation includes a Σ (sigma) operator. In other words, you'll need to calculate ((|o-e|-.05)2/e) for each possible outcome, then add the results to get your chi square value. In our example, we have two outcomes - either the car that received a ticket is red or blue. Thus, we would calculate ((o-e)2/e) twice - once for red cars and once for blue cars.
Example: Let's plug our expected and observed values into the equation x2 = Σ((o-e)2/e). Keep in mind that, because of the sigma operator, we'll need to perform ((o-e)2/e) twice - once for red cars and once for blue cars. Our work would go as follows:

x2 = ((90-100)2/100) + (60-50)2/50)
x2 = ((-10)2/100) + (10)2/50)
x2 = (100/100) + (100/50) = 1 + 2 = 3 .



, Now that we know our experiment's degrees of freedom and our chi square value, there's just one last thing we need to do before we can find our p value - we need to decide on a significance level. Basically, the significance level is a measure of how certain we want to be about our results - low significance values correspond to a low probability that the experimental results happened by chance, and vice versa. Significance levels are written as a decimal (such as 0.01), which corresponds to the percent chance that random sampling would produce a difference as large as the one you observed if there was no underlying difference in the populations.


It is a common misconception that p=0.01 means that there is a 99% chance that the results were caused by the scientist's manipulation of experimental variables. This is NOT the case. If you wore your lucky pants on seven different days and the stock market went up every one of those days, you would have p<0.01, but you would still be well-justified in believing that the result had been generated by chance rather than by a connection between the market and your pants.
By convention, scientists usually set the significance value for their experiments at 0.05, or 5 percent.This means that experimental results that meet this significance level have, at most, a 5% chance of being reproduced in a random sampling process. For most experiments, generating results that are that unlikely to be produced by a random sampling process is seen as ""successfully"" showing a correlation between the change in the experimental variable and the observed effect.
Example: For our red and blue car example, let's follow scientific convention and set our significance level at 0.05.

, Scientists and statisticians use large tables of values to calculate the p value for their experiment. These tables are generally set up with the vertical axis on the left corresponding to degrees of freedom and the horizontal axis on the top corresponding to p-value. Use these tables by first finding your degrees of freedom, then reading that row across from the left to the right until you find the first value bigger than your chi square value. Look at the corresponding p value at the top of the column - your p value is between this value and the next-largest value (the one immediately to the left of it.)


Chi square distribution tables are available from a variety of sources - they can easily be found online or in science and statistics textbooks. If you don't have one handy, use the one in the photo above or a free online table, like the one provided by medcalc.org here.

Example: Our chi-square was 3. So, let's use the chi square distribution table in the photo above to find an approximate p value. Since we know our experiment has only 1 degree of freedom, we'll start in the highest row. We'll go from left to right along this row until we find a value higher than 3 - our chi square value. The first one we encounter is 3.84. Looking to the top of this column, we see that the corresponding p value is 0.05. This means that our p value is between 0.05 and 0.1 (the next-biggest p value on the table).

, Since you have found an approximate p value for your experiment, you can decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis of your experiment (as a reminder, this is the hypothesis that the experimental variables you manipulated did not affect the results you observed.) If your p value is lower than your significance value, congratulations - you've shown that your experimental results would be highly unlikely to occur if there was no real connection between the variables you manipulated and the effect you observed. If your p value is higher than your significance value, you can't confidently make that claim.


Example: Our p value is between 0.05 and 0.1 . It is not smaller than 0.05, so, unfortunately, we can't reject our null hypothesis. This means that we didn't reach the criterion we decided upon to be able to say that our town's police give tickets to red and blue cars at a rate that's significantly different than the national average.
In other words, random sampling from the national data would produce a result 10 tickets off from the national average 5-10% of the time. Since we were looking for this percentage to be less than 5%, we can't say that we're sure our town's police are less biased towards red cars.

""Draft"" or ""High Speed"" print quality works for a faint 'watermark' effect (uses less ink too) You can also adjust Brightness and Contrast in your image editing program to get a similar effect.

Be clean.,
Have gorgeous hair.,
Have a sense of style.,
Be healthy.,
Be a good student.,
Smile.,
Make up a secret nickname for your crush with your closest friends.,
Get him to notice you.,
Try to start flirting.",How to Be Crushed on in School (Girls)," No matter how pretty or nice you are, no one's going to like you if you look or smell dirty. Take regular showers, and use a light-scented body wash and a loofah. Use a sweet-smelling lotion after your bath/shower. Use deodorant if you want. Brush your teeth twice a day and make sure to wear clean, fresh clothes. Also don't do anything gross in public like pick your boogers or something.;
, Don't wash your hair every day, only wash it 2-3 times a week. If your hair gets disgustingly oily in a day without washing, invest in a good dry shampoo. Use a good shampoo and conditioner and make sure it smells subtle but pleasant. Try to let your hair air dry and use heat as less often as possible. Use a heat protectant if you must use heat on your hair regularly. Don't bleach or dye your hair too much either. Curl it, straighten it, put it in a bun, ponytail, braid, anything you want. Or you could just leave it down. Use some cute hair ties and hair accessories. Switch up your hairstyles and make sure they look cute with your outfit. Make sure it is tangle-free and soft.

, You can't be wearing Hello Kitty long sleeved T-shirts and huge, grey sweatpants every day. Shop at places like Forever 21, H&M, Aeropostale, Brandy Melville, Lulu Lemon, etc. Own a lot of black leggings. Those go with anything. Make sure not to go too crazy with patterns or colours. For example, if you wear a striped shirt, try to wear solid-coloured pants. Black and white is a timeless trend. Wear what you think looks nice on you and also keep in mind your comfort. Poky clothes just ruin your day. Also get one pair of good runners (Nike is a good brand), some Uggs, a pair of converse, and some cute flats. Good shoes take you good places. Wear jewelry tastefully and try to wear real jewelry instead of fake jewelry.

, Being healthy solves all your problems. You have shiny hair, strong nails, porcelain skin, and you feel great. Indulge in junk food but don't go overboard, and try to eat healthy foods too. Eat lots of fruits and veggies as well as protein like chicken, eggs, nuts, tofu, etc. Drink lots of water and get a good amount of sleep in. Sleep is one of the most important things ever. Try to get some exercise in each week. You could play a sport, ride your bike around the neighbourhood, go to the gym, do some crunches and push ups at home, anything you want. Just get that heart beating and muscles working.

, Try to be as organized as possible, as it makes school much less stressful. If you aren't an organized person, make a plan to be organized starting the next school year. Listen to the teacher (this is like 60% of being a good student), take good notes (use colourful gel pens to make it more fun), study (read the textbook, use index cards, study with a friend, etc.), and just try your best. Be confident that you're going to ace that test/project/assignment. Try to participate and ask questions if you don't understand as well. Also make sure to do your homework. At all times. No excuses. Getting good grades makes your future that much brighter and it makes you feel good about yourself. People also see smart people as more attractive and enviable.

, If you're that girl who always keeps a smile on her face and positive thoughts, everyone's going to like you. Make sure to smile even when you're feeling down and laugh whenever you feel like it. Even if no one else is laughing. Try not to be negative or looking at the floor all day. Just remember to be yourself and be nice to everyone.

, Something like ""couch potato"" or a twist on their name or some kind of inside joke is always fun. Make sure to only tell your closest friends who your crush is just so you can talk about him with them and not keep your feelings bottled up.

, If you're really quiet or shy, this is the most daunting step. Try to get him to notice you by making eye contact when he does talk to you, or laughing at his jokes. Make sure to walk confidently and be slightly bold. If you want to do something old-fashioned, try to ""accidentally"" bump into him in the halls. Your books will go everywhere and if he says sorry you could say something like ""That's okay it was my fault too."" This just gets him to notice you. He can't like you if he doesn't even know you exist. If you're not afraid, try to make conversation with him and get to know him a bit more. If you're laughing about something no one else knows about with your friends, you can get noticed too.

, Do really subtle things like play with your hair or smile directly at him. Try to tease him a little and steal his stuff once you're a bit more comfortable with him. If you want, you could add some physical contact in by nudging him with your elbow or even hugging him once you get really comfortable.

Place the clothes that you wish to alter into a washing machine.,
Add 2 or 3 pumice stones into the washing machine with the clothes.,
Remove the clothing and pumice stones from the washing machine once the wash cycle is complete.

,
Repeat this method if you have not obtained the desired results.,
Consider using bleach as an alternative to pumice stones.,
Use granulated pumice soaked in bleach as an alternative to bleach alone.

,
Put the bleached clothing in the washer and clean using soap powder.,
Consider a second wash if there is any lingering bleach residue on the clothing.

",How to Stone Wash,";
, Pumice stones were used in the original technique to create the stone washed look because they are abrasive and move thorough the clothes like sandpaper and remove the dye particles from the surface of the yarn.

,, Remember not to overdo the pumice stone method as you may destroy the fabric of the material causing it to rip easily.

, This is known as acid washing where dry clothes are bleached then placed in a washing machine.

,, The granules of pumice are removed.

Try changing the ""prize"".,
Play with random stakes.,
Try using the back end of the bottle to select the kisser.,
Try ""Truth or Dare"" spin the bottle.",How to Play Spin the Bottle2," Though the classic version of spin the bottle is usually associated with teenagers kissing in their parents' basements, there's no rule that says you have to kiss the person that the bottle lands on. To spice things up (or make things more tame), try changing the spinner's ""prize"" to something else. Below are just a few ideas, listed from tamest to most racy:


Giving a compliment
Holding hands
Hugging
Kissing on the cheek
Kissing on the lips
French kissing
Making out
Playing ""Seven Minutes in Heaven""

Removing an article of clothing (for adults only!)

, If you'd like to play a version of spin the bottle with an added element of random chance, grab a six-sided die before you start playing. Designate a specific romantic action to each number 1-6. For instance, you might set 1 as kissing, 2 as hugging, 3 as making out, and so on. When you've assigned six actions, start play as you normally would. When the bottle lands on someone in the circle, the spinner rolls the die. The number that appears on the die determines which action the spinner has to perform on the person the bottle landed on.

, One simple variation of spin the bottle changes who does the kissing each round. Players proceed around the circle, spinning the bottle as normal. However, when the bottle comes to rest, the person that the back of the bottle points to, rather than the spinner, has to kiss the person that the front end of the bottle points at. In this variant, if you spin the bottle and the back end of the bottle ends up pointing at you, you still have to give a kiss — don't spin again.


Because this variant has the people sitting across from each other kissing each other exclusively, it's a smart idea to have everyone take new positions in the circle every few turns.

, One common variant of basic spin the bottle combines the rules of the game with those of Truth or Dare, the classic pranking, secret-telling game played at sleepovers all over the world. To play spin the bottle with Truth or Dare rules, begin as you normally would by having someone spin the bottle in the center of your circle. When the bottle lands on someone, the spinner asks him or her an embarrassing personal question. If s/he decides not to answer, s/he has to perform the dare that the spinner chooses, which can include kissing someone.


A second variant involves the person spinning the bottle announcing a dare to the group before spinning it. The person that the bottle lands on must perform the dare. This includes the person spinning, which adds a unique element of risk to the game.

, Just like on many music players, iTunes has a radio that allows you to search for a genre, artist, or album and iTunes will play songs similar to the item you searched. This is a good way to find new music if you aren't sure where to start and just have a general idea of the type of music you are interested in.To find this function, open your iTunes page.

Once you click on the radio option, iTunes will pull up their featured stations as well as a number of other stations you can choose from.
To personalize your station, as songs are played you can like and dislike certain songs. Move your cursor to the top of the page where it shows what song is playing and an ellipsis icon should appear. Click on that icon and you will see a few options, one of which is ""Play More Like This"" and another is ""Never Play This Song."" You can also purchase songs straight from iTunes by clicking on the price next to the song that is being played.

, If you are looking for new music, you can visit this page to discover music that has recently been released or the top artists, albums, and songs. Apple lists ""Hot Tracks,"" ""New Music,"" ""Top Songs,"" ""Recent Releases"" and many other options suited to helping you find new music.

, This may seem obvious, but a great place to find new music is just by checking out songs on the iTunes store. You can listen to a preview of a song before you decide to buy it, or you can add the song to your wishlist for later listening.


The iTunes store is much like the ""New"" page in that it lists top tracks, new music, and a number of genres to choose from.

Gather your supplies.,
Turn off the curling iron.,
Make sure that your curling iron is not hot.,
Begin by wetting your cloth with either water or rubbing alcohol.,
Wipe down the iron.,
Scrub the barrel with a toothbrush.,
Clean off the cleaner.,
Dry the iron off.",How to Clean Hairspray off of a Curling Iron," You will need a cleaner, a cloth or paper towel, and, possibly, a small scrub brush. Instead of using an all-purpose cleaner, you can use rubbing alcohol to clean the iron. This has the benefit of evaporating and not leaving a strong smell.Any general purpose cleaner will also work, although a cleaner with a strong smell could linger and eventually the smell could be transferred to your hair when you use the curling iron again.
You can also make your own cleaning solution. Simply add one part baking soda to two parts water. This mixture can be used just like a commercial cleaner. The baking soda serves as a gentle abrasive that is good at cleaning off hairspray.
A small brush that is easy to find is an old toothbrush. However, make sure that the toothbrush is very clean, and that no toothpaste residue is still on it.;
, It can be very painful to get an accidental burn from a curling iron. Because of this, you should always make sure a curling iron is turned off before attempting to clean it.


Even if the curling iron isn't on or hot, make sure it's unplugged. This will reduce the risk of electrical shock.

, A turned off and unplugged curling iron can still be too hot to touch. If you have just used your curling iron, you will need to wait a while before attempting to clean it.


While some suggest cleaning a curling iron while it's still a little warm, it's best to clean a completely cold curling iron for safety.You may even want to clean it when you have not used the iron on that day. This will help to avoid the risk of getting burned.

, You do not want to submerge the curling iron in a lot of liquid. That is why applying the liquid to your cleaning cloth is a good idea. This will limit the amount of liquid coming into contact with the iron.


Rubbing alcohol or all-purpose cleaner will work better at breaking down the hair spray than just plain water. However, if you can get the hair spray off simply with water, try that first. This will eliminate the need to wipe the iron down with water at the end to wash off the residual cleaner.

, If that didn't take off all the hairspray, or if you have a lot of hairspray stuck on, begin scrubbing the iron with the paper towel. Start off with the spots that have the most hairspray on them and make sure to scrub in all directions. This may take a while depending on how much hairspray is on the iron.


Make sure to lift the clasp that closes on your hair when in use and clean under there as well! This is a spot that can get particularly gummed up with hairspray.
Clean the handle and the cord too. Hairspray can sometimes get stuck on the handle area of the curling iron. This should be cleaned off so you don't have to touch sticky hairspray every time you pick up your iron.
If the handle of the curling iron has vents, be careful not to get water or cleaner in them. These vents allow air to circulate into the electronics inside the curling iron. These electronics may be damaged if exposed to too much moisture., If the hairspray doesn't come off with a light wiping, you may need to do a bit of scrubbing. Cover your small brush in a bit of cleaner and rub it onto the iron. Look for areas where the hairspray is being particularly resistant to cleaning, and focus your scrubbing there.


The cleaner made of a combination of baking soda and water can be adjusted to make it thicker for this process. Put some baking soda in a bowl and add just enough water to make it into a paste. This paste will stick to the brush, and the iron, better than a thinner cleaner.

, Once you get all of the hair spray off of the curling iron, wash your hands and grab a clean paper towel or napkin. If you used the rubbing alcohol or all-purpose cleaner, wet the paper towel with water and wipe it down the iron to remove any residue it may have left.If you simply used water to clean your curling iron, you do not need to wipe it down again. However, wiping it down with a towel with clean water could get even more of the hair spray residue off the iron.

, Get a dry towel and begin drying off the iron, making sure that there is no water left. Then leave your clean iron alone for a few hours to make sure all the water is completely gone and the iron is dry.


You do not want to use a curling iron with any water left on it. This is a serious electrocution hazard and should be avoided.

Gather your materials.,
Mark the center of your paracord.,
Tie a lanyard knot.,
Make a simple overhand knot.,
Connect the paracord to the carabiner.,
Cobra stitch the paracord.,
King cobra stitch the paracord.,
Cut and melt the loose ends.",How to Make a Paracord Lanyard," To make a paracord lanyard, you will need at least 6–13 feet of paracord 550, a metal carabiner clip, snap hook, or metal key ring, a ruler or tape measure, a twist tie (or something to easily mark a the center of the cord), scissors, and a lighter.The proportions of the paracord can differ depending on how long you want your lanyard to be. For about every foot of paracord length used, you will get about an inch of your braiding knots.If you want to make a lanyard using just cobra stitching, you may only need about 6–8 feet of paracord. However, if you want to make a king cobra stitched lanyard, you may need about 13 feet.
For example, 8 feet of paracord will yield about 8 inches of braiding knots for your lanyard.;
, Fold your long, 6–13 foot paracord in half. At the top of the fold, mark the center by tying a twist tie or rubber band around the paracord.You can really use whatever kind of marker you want, just make sure that it can stay put as you make your knot, and then easily be removed.

, If you are tying this knot for the first time, it may be beneficial to use a sheet of paper to visualize how the cords intertwine to tie the know. Poke two holes vertically, on top of each other, about 4 inches apart through the middle of the paper. Feed the loose ends of the paracord through the holes in the paper, and have the looped end of the cord on the left side of the paper, while the loose ends through the paper go off to the right.Pull the cords all the way through the paper so there is no visible loop hanging on the left side, but rather, the ""loop"" is flush against the paper. You will need about a two-inch loop by the time you’re finished with the knot, so having the cords pulled flush against the paper can help you achieve this. Lay the paper flat on a table.


Take the paracord passing through the bottom hole of the paper, and make a loop near the paper hole.Then take the paracord passing through the top hole, and place it underneath the bottom paracord’s loop. Have the cord sit through the middle of the loop. For example, the top cord should look like a center “pupil” running through an “eyeball” (the loop).Also place the upper cord underneath the bottom loop’s tail cord.
Feed the tag end of the top paracord down through the right side of the “eyeball,” underneath the “pupil,” and up through the left side of the “eyeball.”Gently pull both tails of the cords to tighten the knot just a little bit. You should have a very elaborate and mirrored knot pattern.
Take the tag end of the paracord coming from the bottom of the knot, bring it around to ""trace"" the right of the knot, past the top hole where the other cord is coming from, and underneath all of the upper cords, to come up through the “eyeball” center.The same technique will be used for the other tag end of the paracord.
Bring the upper paracord tail around to ""trace"" the left of the knot, past the bottom hole where the other cord is coming from, underneath all the lower cords, to come up through the “eyeball” center of the knot.Tear off the piece of paper, and hold onto the looped cord that was on the other side of the paper. Gradually pull and tug on both tag ends of the paracords while holding onto the looped cord.Make sure the looped side of the lanyard knot has about a two-inch loop.
The center of the paracord (marked) should be in the middle of that two-inch loop., If the lanyard knot seems too complicated and intricate, you can make a simple overhand knot.From the looped portion of the paracord, pinch down the paracord about 2 inches from the top of the loop. Twist the loop over the tag ends to make another larger hoop, and pull the center of the looped paracord through the middle of the larger hoop.

, Feed the two loose ends of the paracord through the loop of the carabiner clip, snap hook hole, or metal key ring.Pull the ends through the loop until the lanyard knot is about 5 inches away from the base of the clip.If the snap hook hole is pretty wide, you can loop the ends of the cord around one more time, to take up more of the wide space., The two end sides of the paracord are the two cords you will be knotting to create the cobra stitch. You will be knotting onto the two center cords running 5 inches down from the base of the carabiner. Take the left hand paracord, and fold it to the right, over and across the two center cords.Then take the right hand paracord, and pass it on top of the tail end of the left side paracord, under the two center cords, and up through the loop created by the left hand paracord.Then pull the loose ends tight.


To make the next knot, follow the same instructions, except reversed to the other side.Take the right hand paracord, and fold it to the left, across the two center cords. Then take the left hand paracord, and pass it on top of the tail end of the right side paracord, under the two center cords, and up through the loop created by the right hand paracord. Then pull the loose ends tight.
As you continue to knot, you are going to alternate which side of the paracord gets crossed over the two center cords to make the first loop.For example, for the first knot, you made the loop starting with the left hand paracord. For the next knot, start the loop with the right hand paracord. For the knot after that, start the loop with the left hand paracord, and so on and so forth.
Keep cobra stitching over the two center cords until you get 11 knot bumps on each side of the lanyard.If this lanyard is satisfactory to you, you can cut off the excess pieces and melt the loose ends to the rest of the paracord. However, if you want to use up the rest of your paracord, you can do a king cobra stitch.

, A King cobra stitch uses the same technique as a cobra stitch, it is just done on top of an existing cobra stitch, and makes the lanyard a bit thicker.Continue cobra stitching the paracords back toward the carabiner end using the same, alternating sides stitching technique you used earlier. Begin by making the first loop with the paracord that has just gone under a loop.


You can tell which paracord this is by looking at the sides and seeing which paracord is coming out underneath a bump loop on the lanyard.While making the king cobra stitches, you may need to use your fingers to push the knots up toward the top to make them even.However, the king cobra stitch sides will naturally end up matching up with the spaces in between the original cobra stitches., When you are finished king cobra stitching all the way back down to the end of the carabiner, cut off the loose ends of paracord. Leave about ¼-inch space on the snipped ends.Melt each snipped end with a lighter, using the lower, darker part of the flame to melt the paracord rather than burn it.After about 5-10 seconds of melting the paracord end, push the paracord against rest of the lanyard with the metal part of your lighter.This will help cool the melted paracord and connect the melted end to the rest of the lanyard.


Do this same melting procedure for the other snipped end of the paracord.When both loose ends of the paracord are melted and secure, you are ready to use your paracord lanyard.

Steam the cauliflower and preheat the oven.,
Mash the cauliflower and garlic.,
Combine the mashed cauliflower with the yogurt, cheese, and whole eggs.,
Beat the egg whites and fold them into the cauliflower biscuit dough.,
Fill a mini-muffin tin and bake the cauliflower biscuits.",How to Cook Cauliflower Biscuits1," Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Wash 1 head of cauliflower and discard any leaves. Chop the cauliflower into chunks while you heat a sauce pot with a little water in it. Set the cauliflower inside a steamer basket and place it in the pot. Cover the pot and steam the cauliflower until it's very soft.It should take 10 to 12 minutes for the cauliflower to become tender.;
, Place the steamed cauliflower into a food processor along with 3 cloves of minced garlic. Put the lid on the processor and blitz it a few times, so the cauliflower is pureed. The mixture should be completely smooth.The softer your cauliflower is, the smoother it will be once you puree it. This is why it's important to steam it until it's completely tender.

, Get out a large mixing bowl and scoop the pureed cauliflower mixture into it. Stir in more of the biscuit dough ingredients with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the mixture is completely combined. You'll need to mix in:1/3 cup (95 g) of nonfat Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded cheddar cheese
2 eggs
1 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

, Get out another mixing bowl and place 2 egg whites in it. Use an electric or stand mixer to beat the egg whites on high speed. Beat the egg whites for a few minutes, so they become stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the cauliflower mixture.To fold the egg whites, hold a spatula and carefully use a twisting motion with your wrist to combine the cauliflower mixture with the lighter egg whites. The goal is to maintain the volume of the egg whites.

, Spray a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray, to prevent sticking. Fill the cups with the cauliflower biscuit dough, so the dough comes to the top of each cup. Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes. They should brown and look a little crisp around the edges. Let the biscuits cool on a rack until they're cool enough to handle and serve.Consider using a small cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups. You could also just use a few small spoons to scoop the dough.

Determine the number you are computing the factorial for.,
Write out the sequence of numbers to be multiplied.,
Multiply the numbers together.",How to Do Factorials1," A factorial is denoted by a positive integer and an exclamation point.

For example, if you need to compute the factorial for 5, you will see 5!{\displaystyle 5!}.
;
, A factorial is simply multiplying the natural numbers that descend sequentially from the factorial number, down to 1.Speaking formulaically, n!=n(n−1)⋅⋅⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle n!=n(n-1)\cdot \cdot \cdot 2\cdot 1}, where n{\displaystyle n} equals any positive integer.For example, if you are computing 5!{\displaystyle 5!}, you would compute 5(5−1)(5−2)(5−3)(5−4){\displaystyle 5(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)} or, denoted more simply: 5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}.


, You can compute a factorial quickly using a scientific calculator, which should have a x!{\displaystyle x!} sign. If you are computing by hand, to make it easier, first look for pairs of factors that multiply to equal 10.Of course, you can also ignore the 1, since any number multiplied by 1 equals that number.

For example, if computing 5!=5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 5!=5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}, disregard the 1, and first calculate 5⋅2=10{\displaystyle 5\cdot 2=10}. Now all you are left with is 4⋅3=12{\displaystyle 4\cdot 3=12}. Since 10⋅12=120{\displaystyle 10\cdot 12=120}, you know that 5!=120{\displaystyle 5!=120}.

Buy a whole stalk of celery. Make sure that the stalk is light green, firm, and unblemished. If the stalk is whitish, soft, or cracked it may be going bad; if the leaves are wilted, choose a fresher stalk.
If you're looking for a quick and convenient snack, consider buying a package of pre-cut celery sticks. Again, pre-packaged sticks may not be as fresh as whole-stalk, locally-grown celery, but they take less work to prepare if you're in a hurry.;
, Celery is a Mediterranean plant, and it grows best in temperate climates with temperatures between 59 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


Celery is a long-season crop, and it may be difficult to grow in areas with brief summers. The seeds sprout best when they are sprouted indoors.
You should be able to find a package of celery seeds at a local nursery or garden-supply store. You may be able to harvest wild celery seeds; refer to botanical field guides, or ask a friend who grows celery in her garden.
If you grow your own celery, you can collect the seeds and use them as seasoning. With care and planning, you can ensure that you will have a consistent supply of celery from year to year.

, Use fresh, running water, but don't use soap or detergent. There's a chance that commercially-grown celery has been sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals, and a thorough rinsing can remove many potential contaminants. Washing can also reduce the risk of contracting any number of food-borne illnesses., You may store celery in the crisper drawer, in a well-sealed plastic bag, or in a bowl or jar with the end of the stalk submerged in a bit of water to keep it fresh.


When properly stored, fresh (whole) celery should last 3-4 weeks past the printed sell-by date; pre-packaged celery should last 2-3 days past the printed date; and cooked celery should last up to one week after it is cooked.Celery is not always sold with an expiration date. Use your intuition: if the stalk is whitish, soft, cracked, or wilted, it may be going bad.
If you won't use your celery before four weeks have passed, consider freezing it and thawing it out when you need it.

, If you buy a whole, fresh stalk of celery, cut off the leaves at the top; compost the leaves or put them out with the trash.


If you will be dipping the celery into a sauce or condiment, chop the stalk into pieces ranging from 3-4 inches in length.
If you are cooking with celery or mixing it into a salad, chop it into smaller, bite-sized pieces, or dice it finely.

Remove items from atop and around the toilet.,
Rinse or dust the items that were on or around the toilet.,
Spray the floor around the toilet with the disinfectant spray.",How to Clean a Toilet3," Before you begin, clear the toilet of things that may obstruct you while cleaning - tissue boxes, photos, etc.. Because you want to give the toilet a thorough cleaning, you'll need to be able to reach every nook and cranny.


Clearing items away from the toilet won't just allow you to clean under and around them - it will keep them out of the way, safe from harmful cleaners, and will prevent any accidental drops into the toilet.

, You don't want to make your sparkling clean toilet impure by transferring dust onto it from an unclean picture frame or tissue box. Put on clean gloves, then give the items that were on or around the toilet a quick clean. Wet and lightly scrub them if they're waterproof, or, if they're not, just give them a quick pass with a brush. Wipe the items clean with a paper towel and put them back in their places.


When you've finished, take your gloves off and wash your hands as a precaution against the spread of bacteria.

, Often, if your toilet's dirty, the floor around it is too. You don't want to get your feet dirty every time you use the toilet, so take the opportunity to clean the surrounding section of floor. Use a brush or broom to sweep up any loose hair or debris around, and especially behind, the body of the toilet. Wipe the area clean with wet paper towels, disposable wipes, or a cloth.

Spot a sphere.,
Learn the formula for the volume of a sphere.,
Find the radius of the sphere.,
Measure the sphere if the radius is not given.,
Cube the radius to find r3.,
Now multiply your answer by 4/3.,
Multiply the result by π to find the volume of the sphere.,
Express your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume6," A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, in which every point on the surface is an equal distance from the center. In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object., The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = 4/3πr3 (stated: ""four-thirds times pi r-cubed"") where r is the radius of the sphere, and π is the constant pi (3.14)., If the radius is given in the diagram, then finding r is simply a matter of locating it. If the diameter is given, you must divide this number by 2 to find the radius. For example, the radius of the sphere in the diagram is 3 inches.

, If you need to measure a spherical object (like a tennis ball) to find the radius, first find a piece of string large enough to wrap around the object. Then wrap the string around the object at its widest point and mark the points where the string overlaps itself. Then measure the string with a ruler to find the circumference. Divide that value by 2π, or 6.28, and that will give you the radius of the sphere.

For example, if you measure a ball and find its circumference is 18 inches, divide that number by 6.28 and you will find that the radius is 2.87in.
Measuring a spherical object can be a little tricky, so you might want to take 3 different measurements, and then average them together (add the three measurements together, then divide by 3) to make sure you have the most accurate value possible.
For example, if your three circumference measurements were 18 inches, 17.75 inches, and 18.2 inches, you would add those three values together (18 + 17.5 + 18.2 = 53.95) and divide that value by 3 (53.95/3 = 17.98). Use this average value in your volume calculations.

, Cubing a number simply means multiplying the number by itself 3 times, so r3 = r * r * r. In our example, r = 3, so r3 = 3 * 3 * 3, or 27.

, You can either use your calculator, or do the multiplication by hand and then simplify the fraction. In our example, multiplying 27 by 4/3 = 108/3, or 36.

, The last step in calculating the volume is simply to multiply the result so far by π. Rounding π to two digits is usually sufficient for most math problems (unless your teacher specified otherwise,) so multiply by 3.14 and you have your answer.


In our example, 36 * 3.14 = 113.09.

, In our example, the measurement of the radius of the sphere was in inches, so our answer is actually V = 113.09 cubic inches (113.09 in3).

You may also need multiple copies of your passport pages.The application requirements can change, so be sure to check the immigration website before heading to the office to submit everything. Your local ministry office also has blank application copies available.
Once you’ve dropped everything off, you will receive a receipt. Make sure to hold onto this as it will allow you to pick up your residency certificate after the processing period., You will most likely be asked to sit for an interview with immigration officers. These officers will try to gauge your understanding of the Thai language. They will ask questions to verify the information provided in your application documents.Make sure that you are on-time for your scheduled interview or it can negatively impact your application. Most interviews are scheduled when you drop off your application materials.
You can also request that the officers provide a printed transcript of your answers at the end of the interview., You will also be asked to complete a short test composed of questions written in Thai. Be aware that you can ask for a question translation as well from a Thai immigration officer., When the testing phase is completed, you will be asked to step into a separate area. You will then stand in front of a camera and record a brief introductory statement in Thai., It is important that all of your foreign language documents are certified by your national embassy. They will also need to be translated into Thai as well. Make sure to leave plenty of time to complete these processes as they make take months, depending on the embassy workload., To increase the odds of your application being accepted, you are allowed to submit additional documents supporting your character.

Snip away the flower buds.,
Prune your dogwood to encourage flowering in early summer.",How to Prune a Dogwood2," Cut off the buds at the tip of each branch to redirect energy to buds on the side of the branch. By removing a singe bud, you encourage the development of multiple buds, leading to a fuller setting of flowers. These buds can either be snipped off with shears or pinched off by hand.

, June is generally considered the best month for this type of pruning, but any time in the early summer will work. You should not snip buds off during the dormant season since doing so will cut the flowers off before they have the chance to open, rather than simply redirecting the energy. Do not wait too late into the summer, though, because doing so will not allow the buds to build up enough energy for new shoots and buds for the next year."

Think about using a bulb planter to plant your bulb.,
Know that you can use the “free form” method to plant some bulbs.,
Feed your bulbs once they’ve been planted.,
Water your bulbs to help them grow.",How to Plant Bulbs in Grass3," This method works for all bulbs. You can use a bulb planter to make a hole in the sod, drop the bulb into the hole and pop the sod out of the bulb planter to cover the bulb.


The bulbs should be planted two to three times as deep as the bulb’s width. Water the newly-planted bulbs until the soil is moist to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm).

, In particular, crocus and daffodil bulbs can be planted using the “free form” method. Simply use a dirt shovel or small hand shovel to open a wedge in the ground and drop the bulb into the wedge with the pointed end up.


They will grow their roots into the soil and be covered naturally with leaves and other debris over the fall and winter.

, Give the bulbs fertilizer when they begin to grow leaves. Usually, ½ to 1 pound of fertilizer is sufficient for 50 square feet of planted area but this varies, depending on the fertilizer formula.


A balanced 10-10-10 or 5-10-10 fertilizer works well for bulbs.

, Water them often enough to keep the soil uniformly moist until after they stop blooming. Spring bulbs do not need supplemental water in most areas.


On the other hand, summer and fall bulbs will need to be watered regularly.

Think about why you want to discuss politics.,
Listen.,

Admit when you do not know something.,
Find common ground regularly during the discussion.,
Respect a work or party decision to place politics off-limits.,
Gage your relationship with the person you are talking to.,
Concede a point.,
Remember that you don't need to win in a friendly discussion.",How to Discuss Politics in a Friendly Setting1," Politics can be considered to be propelled by the reinforcement theory, that people seek out political discussion and information that supports their own political views. Understand that discussing politics in a mixed social setting will lead to opposing beliefs and it should lead to more thoughtful discussion.;
, Before jumping to any conclusions, listen to the other person's point of view. Ask thoughtful questions if their views are not completely clear.


Avoid using questions, such as ""How could you think that?"" Instead, ask questions like ""What is your opinion about...?"" or ""What makes you feel that way?""

, This is along the lines of the classic ""think before you speak"" adage. Try to be empathetic toward their point of view, and you are likely to achieve more thoughtful conclusions about your own beliefs.

, If you are quoting sources, make sure you recognize potential flaws in the facts or how you are quoting. This is another example of reinforcement theory, since you may consider your sources to be objective, but other people may consider them subjective.

, No one likes a ""know-it-all,"" so be prepared to learn something new in any discussion. The talk is much more likely to remain friendly if no one insists on always being right.

, In order to have a friendly discussion, try to return to points you agree on from time to time. Most people can agree on a few things that they think are working or that they think need reform.

, Some party hosts, family members and work environments ask that people leave their political beliefs for their private interactions. This rule has probably been brought about because of a past problem, so respect the desire to host a politics-free social engagement.

, Some political discussions are not worth the possibility of making a relationship strained. Get to know the person better before trying to engage the person in political talk.


If someone engages you in political discussion and you are unsure of your relationship, approach the talk with caution, especially if alcohol is involved. It is better to find common ground and change the subject than to get into an argument.

, Part of maintaining friendly discussion is a frank desire to say when you agree. Indicating that you understand and asking a follow up question may make the discussion more enjoyable.

, In fact, save the winning mentality for political debates or people that are very close to you. Enter into polite political discussion to learn something and get a better background of your friends and the issues.

Select a heat source.,
Select a roasting vessel.,
Bring meat to room temperature before roasting.,
Roast meat uncovered.,
Start meat at a higher heat, then lower the temperature.,
Rest the meat after roasting.",How to Roast Meat1," Conventional ovens are the most basic way of roasting meat, while convection ovens will use circulating air to speed up the cooking process slightly. The cooking times for convection ovens will be slightly lower for all kinds of meat. While most meat is roasted in a traditional conventional oven, meat can be roasted in a variety of ways:


Cooking indoors in a conventional oven is the most common way of roasting meats. Meat should be roasted in the middle of the rack, at a temperature between 280 and 400 degrees F. Leaner meats should be roasted at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time while fattier meats should be roasted low and slow.
Roasting pits and tandoors are very hot electric or wood-fire ovens that can be used to roast meat very quickly. In some regions, these are very common methods of commercial cooking, roasting meats at upward of 500 or 600 °F (260 or 316 °C) for a short period of time, which results in very juicy, crispy meat.
Outdoor charcoal grills or smokers can be used to roast meat, though this is more typically called barbecuing, or smoking. Still, it fits the bill of cooking meat at a low temperature for a long period of time over indirect heat, provided you have a coal chimney to heat the cooking chamber. This is a particularly common way of cooking pork.;
, Meat needs to be placed on or into some kind of dish to keep the juices from flowing all over the oven or the heat source. Typically, roasting pans are used, but different meats will need to be roasted in different vessels. If you don't have one, disposable roasting pans are available at all grocery stores, or you can fold one out of aluminum foil.


Roasting pans should be used for beef, poultry, lamb, and anything that you want to cook on top of vegetables. While the bottom of the meat won't be ""crusted,"" cooking in a roasting pan is the easiest method.
Roasting racks can be used to cook the meat on all sides. These are typically used for things like lamb, so the meat can sit up off the pan, and allow the juices to drip through to a pan underneath. This is an excellent method of roasting to collect juices for gravy.
Rotisseries are often used for cooking chickens, turning the meat continuously to achieve an even roast. While these are relatively uncommon for home cooking, some small single-chicken sized rotisseries are commercially available.

, Large roasts, chickens, and other big cuts of meat that you're planning to roast need to be set out on the counter for a few hours before you put them in the oven, bringing the meat up to room temperature. This is to ensure that the meat cooks evenly, and that you don't have a blackened outside with a nearly-raw inside on a big cut of beef.


Taking cold meat directly out of the fridge and putting it into the hot oven will heat up the outside first, while the inside remains cold. It's very difficult to cook meat properly without letting it come up to room temperature first.
Always thaw frozen meat thoroughly in the refrigerator overnight before attempting to roast it. Let it come up to room temperature as normal.

, To caramelize the outside of the roast, meat should typically be roasted uncovered for the entirety of the cooking process, then covered after removing it from the oven, to rest the meat appropriately before carving it. Covering the meat will not make it juicier or more tender. Cooking it properly will.


It's also important that you do not add any liquid to the bottom of the pan to keep the meat moist. This is a process called braising, an effective cooking technique in and of itself, but it's not done when you're roasting.

, Different meats will be roasted at different temperatures, anywhere between 280 F and 400 F, depending on the dish you're making and the cut. Typically, though, meat is started at a higher temperature, cooked for 15 or 20 minutes, then the temperature is lowered to around 350 or 375 F, while the meat roasts for several hours. Specific directions for different types of meat are discussed in the following sections.


Tender cuts, like filets and tenderloins should be roasted at a higher temperature the whole time, for a shorter period of time. These cuts do not benefit from ""low and slow"" cooking, which helps to tenderize tougher or cheaper cuts, like pork shoulder or chuck roast.
Always make sure the oven has fully pre-heated before putting the meat into it. You don't want to gradually bring the meat up, you want to put it into a fully-hot oven. This will help to cook the meat more evenly and keep it juicy. There'll be less guess-work if you do it right.

, Meat is comprised of tightly woven strands of protein, which release water as the temperature is increased. This mixes with the fat in the meat that renders as it heats, creating the flavorful juices that make meat taste good. If you cut immediately into a very hot piece of meat, those juices will run right out of the meat and onto the plate. Letting the fibers relax some by lowering the temperature slightly, letting the meat sit covered for 10-20 minutes, will reabsorb those juices into the meat and the meat will taste better. This is why all meat, especially beef and poultry, should be rested."

Add studs.,
Tool your collar.,
Punch holes.",How to Decorate a Dog's Collar2," This classic decoration will make your dog look stylish and tough. You can simply add a row of them, arrange them in a pattern, or even spell out your dog’s name.Start by marking your design onto the top of the collar with scratches using an X-Acto blade. Then, use the X-Acto blade to cut parallel holes wherever you’d like your studs to go.
Push each stud through its hole, and screw the tails in securely using a screwdriver or pliers. To ensure it’s snugly attached to the collar, tap each side of the stud with a hammer.
Studs are available for purchase online and at most craft stores. Be sure to get ones that match the thickness of your dog’s leather collar.
Remember not to add too much metal to your dog's collar. You don't want to weigh your dog's neck down with studs.

, Tooling allows you to add durable designs and lettering to leather collars. You’ll need to get leather tools with letters and/or patterns that will give you the desired design. Then, soften the leather by using a spray bottle to mist it with water a few times. After you let it sit for two minutes, arrange the tool where you’d like it to be on top of the collar, and strike it firmly using a leather crafting mallet to imprint your design.Remember that the tool pattern is the mirror opposite of what will appear on your dog's collar.
Be sure to strike the tools against a hard surface.
You can decorate the imprints with craft paint to add color.
Let your freshly tooled collar rest overnight, and then apply a coat of leather stain that matches the collar’s color before putting it on your dog.

, Create cut-out designs on your dog’s leather collar using a leather hole punch. You can use this method to decorate without adding extra weight or potentially dangerous metal to your dog’s collar.Mark where you’d like your holes on the collar first, using a piece of chalk. If you’re going for a precise design, use a gridded paper or ruler to ensure that your placement is accurate.
Set the size and shape of hole you’d like on your leather hole puncher. Place the point where you’d like your hole to be on the leather, and compress the handles of the pliers to punch the hole by hand.
If you don’t want to invest in a leather hole punch, you can also create holes using an awl (or, alternatively, a large nail) and a mallet. Position your collar over a scrap piece of wood. Then, place the awl’s point where you’d like your hole to go, and strike it firmly with a mallet to slowly drive a hole through the collar.

Finished.",How to Make Cinnamon Toast1," Take the butter out of the refrigerator before you perform the other steps. Heat the butter up in the microwave for 30 seconds or let it sit out in room temperature until you're ready to use it.;
, Stir together the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon until they are mixed thoroughly.

, Anything that can have a broad sliced surface to hold melted butter will work. It shouldn't be very stale, but slightly stale bread temporarily improves with heating., Take out or make however many slices you like and toast them. If making slices to toast simultaneously, make them about equally thick so they finish toasting simultaneously.

, Right after the toast finishes, set it on a plate and butter it. Slice a pat of butter (or whatever you use) onto each slice of toast, and let it melt a bit. Smear the butter with the knife so its evenly distributed.

, The butter will make it stick.

, Try serving with milk.

Use a fitted bed sheet as a bed skirt.,
Pin a long strip of fabric in place of a bed skirt.,
Try using a dropcloth.",How to Make a Bed Skirt2," If you're not up for sewing and want a fast and easy bed skirt, you can use a fitted bed sheet instead. Simply put the fitted sheet over the box spring instead of the mattress, and tuck the elastic band along the bottom under the box spring. Voila! You've now successfully covered the box spring with a sheet that already matches your bedding and decor.Using a fitted bed sheet will not cover any space under the box spring, meaning that under-the-bed storage will be exposed.

, If you want the ruffled look and storage cover of a real bed skirt without the sewing, you can simply pin some fabric in place. Measure the distance around the perimeter of your bed and the height from the floor to the top of the box spring, and cut a long strip of fabric that meets these dimensions. Pin this in place using straight pins along the edge of the box spring. Put the pins on the top of the box spring, so that when the mattress is replaced, you can't see that your skirt is actually just pinned in place.

, The final easy no-sew alternative to a traditional bed skirt, is using a piece of fabric large enough to cover the entirety of the box spring and then drape to the floor. The best option for this, without spending loads of money? A regular dropcloth. A linen dropcloth will cover the entire space of a queen size bed or smaller, and have enough excess fabric to reach the floor. Just spread the dropcloth out over your box spring, and use pins to hold it in place around the perimeter. You're done!"

Use your body to sing.,
Don’t push your voice.,

Understand what makes your voice type.,
Understand that you will not be able to perfectly emulate Ariana's voice.,
Find your tune.,
Improve your high notes.,
Add the mechanics of a yawn.,
Sing in falsetto.",How to Sing Like Ariana Grande," If you feel your singing voice is awful, it is likely because you’re not using specific parts of your body correctly. To use your body, keep your mouth slack and exhale gently. Keep your mouth flexible and loose. When practicing, use an “Ahh-ah” sound. The first “Ahh” should be slightly higher in pitch and tone than the second.Sing from your diaphragm to project.;
, When you push your voice forcefully or strain it, your body will tighten up. This will in turn strain your throat muscles and you will lose much of your tone and air supply. If your voice is being pushed, it will sound out of tune or it will crack and break., Several singers struggle with proper tune and pitch. One way to perfect your pitch and tune is to play notes on the piano and imitate them with your voice., If you’re really struggling with your voice, try this vocal fix. Watch your jaw move as you say “A-E-I-O-U”. Determine what vowels your jaw closes on. It is likely the vowels E and U. Try again, taking care to keep your jaw propped open. Practice singing while keeping your jaw equally open. This may take a lot of practice to perfect but will eventually become natural. Having your mouth open equally on all sounds will help keep a uniform and even voice.If you’re struggling to keep your jaw wide, wedge your fingers or a piece of cork in your mouth and try again. Practice until you no longer need the wedge to keep your mouth open., Vibrato is the way to change pitch in your voice. It allows your singing to be breathy and charismatic. Knowing how to control your vibrato is a good thing, as some contemporary singers, like Ariana, have a small amount of vibrato so having the control is important.Practice vibrato techniques. For example, stand in front of a mirror. Press on your chest with your hands then raise your chest up. Breathe in and exhale, while holding your chest steady. Sing a note and hold it as long as possible without moving your chest. Halfway through, press down with your hands but keep your chest raised to meet the pressure. Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open wide as you belt out the note. Imagine the air in your mouth swirling while tucking your chin slightly and keeping your chest raised., There are a number of variables that make up the type of voice you have. The variables that create your singing voice include range, weight, tessitura, timbre, transition points, vocal registers, speech level, and your physical characteristics.Range is determined by the notes that your body is able to produce.Weight refers to whether your voice is light and agile or heavy, rich, and powerful.Tessitura are the notes, or part of your range, that you are most comfortable singing.Timber is what makes your voice unique in terms of quality and texture. Some people may have a more gravelly voice while Ariana does not.Transition points are where you transition from singing from your chest register, to middle, and to your head.Vocal register refers to how long you can extend your notes.Speech level is the range of your speaking voice.Physical characteristics play into your singing voice as some people may have larger lungs and stronger vocal cords., Everyone has their own singing voice because of a number of factors so it is extremely rare to be able to reproduce someone else's voice 100%. Do not be discouraged if you do not sound exactly like Ariana. First, refine your vocal talents then you can emulate her stage presence and performance style.

, Ariana is a falsetto singer, which means she sings softly when hitting high notes. This isn’t practical for every singer, but once you find your own vocal range you can sing in tune. Singing in tune is half the battle and will make your voice sound significantly better. Once you’ve found your tune, you can try pairing your voice to Ariana’s music.If you’re struggling to sing in tune, pair up with a piano. Playing basic keys on the piano will allow you to check if your voice is matching the tune of the piano correctly., When singing high notes, think “down”. This means, if you sing high notes imagine your voice has resistance and weight. In contrast, if you were singing a low note, your voice would be light and airy.Add weight to your belly to keep your voice resisted.


Imagine an elevator as your voice. Imagine how as the elevator rises, the counter weight must go down to get the elevator to its height., Imagine a yawn and your soft palate. Your soft palate is located at the back of the roof of your mouth. When your mouth opens to yawn, your soft palate raises. This allows you to project your voice, and sometimes, increase the tune of your vocal range., Falsetto singing, used by Ariana, will add character and depth to your voice. Falsetto is meant to be mostly high pitched, in a soft, quiet voice. Imagine a 3 or 4 year old child singing and try to emulate that with the voice you are projecting.To practice falsetto, sing to the tune of a siren or ambulance. Releasing an “ahhhh” sound to the highest note you can reach without cracking, and coming back down is a great way to practice.Another great way to practice is with the vowels “e” and “o”. These vowel pronunciations are perfect for the soft, child-like singsong voice. Sing them from low to high pitches."

Finally, turn Groups on or off if needed.",How to Read a Book on an iPad Using a Pillow Switch," The iOS 8 operating system for Apple products includes extensive accessibility options that can be accessed via the Settings on an iPad. These options include a Switch Control system.  However, the iPad does not contain jacks that permit a switch to be connected directly to it. Instead one must connect a switch control device, such as the Tecla Shield, to the iPad via a wireless Bluetooth connection, and then plug a pillow switch, or some other switch such as a puff sip switch, into the switch control device.;
, This will allow you to control the iPad.

, iBooks seems to be the best iPad reader for single switch use, much easier to use than Read2Go or the Kindle app. It allows you to turn a page by clicking and then waiting for the scanner to move only two times, before clicking twice again. If you want to turn several pages or more at a time (in effect, skimming ahead or back), you can do that with any number of rapid clicks (not waiting between clicks). It allows a smooth adjustment of font sizes so that you can pick the one that is perfect for you. It never causes a reading page to extend beyond the page boundaries, so that you never have to scroll up or down, except when you are looking through an index. As an Apple proprietary app, its performance seems pretty solid.

, Bookshare.org is a wonderful resource, providing access to many excellent books, magazines and newspapers that you can download without charge (after paying $25 to join and a $50 annual fee). You must have a disability and be able to get a professional to certify to that fact in order to join Bookshare. Unfortunately, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format. Therefore, you will need to convert the DAISY files you get from Bookshare to the EPUB format – see the instructions below.

,, If you're using a Tecla Shield, you should see a fairly rapid (1 blink per second) flashing white light coming from the circuit board inside. This means that the device is in “Switch Control” mode and also that it is ready to pair. 


If you want to pair the Tecla to a new device, you must first unpair it from the old one. 
If the light is flashing some other color, use the tip of a pen and push on either the “-“ or the “+” button until the light begins to flash rapidly.  The light will eventually begin to flash a different color.  Repeat this step until the light is flashing white, about one blink per second, indicating that the Tecla is ready for pairing.

,  This will reduce the amount of time required to press and hold the pillow switch in order to return to the iPad’s Home screen.

, This is primarily useful for reading incoming emails in the iPad's Mail app. Go to Settings, Display and Brightness, Text Size, and adjust the slider to change the text size. Check the results by looking at an incoming message in the Mail app.

If you need to use even larger text, go to Settings, General, Accessibility, Larger Text, and then turn Larger Accessibility Sizes on. You can now move another slider to adjust text size. Again, check the results in the Mail app. If the text size is set too large, the lines of text may overlap and become unreadable.

, Turn Bluetooth on, and pair the iPad with the switch control device.  To do this, click the name of the device (e.g. TeclaShieldDOS) listed under Devices. The status should change from Not Paired to Connected.  


If the pairing doesn’t work, try removing the device from My Devices by pushing the small “i” button to the right of it and clicking Forget This Device.  Then try pairing again.
After the switch control device is paired, the white light will flash much more slowly.

,  Remove any previous settings.  Set Accessibility Shortcut to Switch Control.  This will allow you to turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s home button.

,  Activate the pillow switch by pressing it. Click Save.  Choose Select Item from the switch action menu that will pop up.

, Go to Settings, General > Accessibility > Switch Control. The following settings are recommended:


Set Auto Scanning to on.  You may adjust the Auto Scanning Time. Two seconds or less may work for somewhat experienced users, but beginners may need a longer time. This sets the speed in Item Scanning (as opposed to Point Scanning).
Turn Pause on First Item on.  Set the pause duration to 1 second, initially.  This setting allows the user to think for a moment when a new menu line pops up, before deciding what to do next.
Set the Loops to 2, initially. This is the number of times that the scanner will circle the available options before it stops. Having more loops gives you more time to choose from the different options while the scanner lines are moving, but it slows things down.
Turn Auto Tap off.
Turn Move Repeat off.
Turn Hold Duration off.
Turn Ignore Repeat off.
Set Gliding Cursor speed to 15. You may need to set this speed to a lower number at first. This sets the speed in Point Scanning (as opposed to Item Scanning).
Set Sound Effects off.
Set Speech off.
Set Included Menu items to all.
Set Group Items to on.
Set Large Cursor to on (All).
Set Cursor Color to Blue (or whatever color you like).
Set Saved Gestures to None.

, Go to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control. Turn Switch Control on.  Note that you may also turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s Home button (the large button on the front).  This is the Accessibility Shortcut mentioned above.  Turning switch control off will allow someone to use the iPad in the normal way.  Turning switch control on will cause scanning to start.

, Switch control on the iPad relies on two very different scanning methods:  item scanning and point scanning. 


Item scanning, in which the scanner jumps from one item or group of items to another, is much easier to use, since it requires fewer clicks once you have settled into an activity like reading. 
However, it’s important to learn how to use point scanning as well, since it gives you more control and flexibility.  Point scanning employs lines that move smoothly across the screen, horizontally and then vertically, requiring the user to click at precise locations to form X’s (or crosses).  You cannot switch between item scanning and point scanning by using the iPad’s Options settings.  Instead, you must use the submenus that pop up after you have selected a point on the screen with either scanning method – see the instructions below.

, Item scanning highlights an item or a group of items for a short time and then jumps to another item or group of items. To change to item scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the first submenu that pops up, and click on Item mode.

, Point scanning uses lines that move smoothly across the screen.  To change to point scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the submenu that pops up, and click on Point mode.

, Note that anyone can practice operating an iPad with a single switch, even if he or she doesn’t have a Tecla Shield and a pillow switch.  To do this, set up your switch type by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Switch Control > Switches, Add New Switch - all as described above - but this time choose Screen rather than External as the switch type.  Then choose Full Screen, Select Item.  After these steps have been taken, a caretaker with an iPad can simulate using a pillow switch by simply touching anywhere on the iPad’s screen and thus gain valuable experience in controlling the iPad with a single switch.

,
Make sure that Item Scanning is on.
Make sure that Groups are set to On.
Make sure that Passcode in the iPad is turned Off. Go to Settings, Passcode.

,


If the iPad is asleep, wake it up by clicking once on the pillow switch.
If the iPad is locked, click the pillow switch. Scanning will start.  When the highlight reaches the Slide to Unlock area, click it again.  Note that, when you click the switch, a small black Popup menu will often be displayed.  The Popup menu contains choices.  The first choice is Tap.  If you click on Tap, that will select “Slide to Unlock” in the initial screen - but you must click right away, before the other choices come up.  If you don’t click Tap in time, or if you click at the wrong time, just wait for the highlight to come around to Tap again.  You should only have to wait for the highlight to go around two times, if you have set the Loops to 2 (see above).  Then, when it stops moving, you can click again to start scanning and wait for the right moment to click a second time in order to choose the option you want.

, Suppose you are in the Home screen or some other app screen and you want to open an app.  Stop and wait until a grouping containing that app is highlighted, click that grouping, stop and wait until the app is highlighted, click that app, and then click Tap.

, Suppose you are in the Home screen and you want to move to another screen.  Select any app as described above, but this time don’t click Tap.  Instead, wait a moment until the Scroll Right choice is highlighted, and then click that choice to move to the second screen.

, Suppose you want to go back to the Home screen.  Click on any app, as described above, but do not click Tap.  Instead wait until the little Oval Icon at the bottom of the popup menu is highlighted and click on that.  Then wait until the top row of choices is highlighted and click on that row.  Then wait until Home is highlighted and click on Home.

, Another way to return to the Home screen is to simply press and hold the pillow switch for about five seconds.

, See settings directions above.

,  Click on the book you want to read.  When you want to turn a page, click and wait for the scanner to highlight the Progress Bar (the long thin line) at the bottom of the page.  Then click.  This will bring up a menu with three choices:  Decrement, Increment and the Oval icon.  Click on Decrement to turn the page to the left.  Click on Increment to turn the page back to the right.  Click on the Oval icon, to see the first submenu.

,  You get to the first submenu by clicking on the Oval icon, which appears after you have selected something on the screen.  Then you will see Home, Gestures and Escape in the first row.  When the highlight gets to the second row, if you are in Item mode, you will see Point Mode, Device and Settings.  (If you are in Point Mode, you will see Item Mode, Device and Settings.)  Wait until the highlight reaches the row you want, click once, and then wait until the item you want is highlighted before clicking again.

,  If you select Settings in the second row of the first submenu, you go to the second submenu.  Here you will see Back, Speed Up, Slow Down, and Move Menu.  In the second row, you will see Scan Order, Speech Off, Sound Off and Groups On.  To change the Scan Order, click on Scan Order in the second row.

, If necessary, you can use the Move Menu choice to move the popup menu so that it is out of the way.  The Bottom or Bottom Right positions are probably best, so that the popup menu will be out of the way when you start reading a page and usually disappear by the time you get to the bottom of the screen.

, When reading a book in the iBooks app, it's better to reverse the scan direction, so that the highlight will arrive at the Progress Bar at the bottom of the page more quickly, allowing you to turn a page by clicking and waiting for the scanner highlight to move two times (as opposed to five or six times with forward scanning, depending on whether the iPad is in Landscape or Portrait mode), before clicking twice again to finish turning the page., When scanning in Item Mode, it's faster to group choices together into groups. If you see Groups Off, click on this icon to turn Groups On., Note:  these instructions are based on experience with a Windows 7 desktop PC, but they could be adapted for use with other PC's.

, As mentioned above, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format.  To convert DAISY files to the EPUB format, a range of options area available; DAISYtoEPUB is recommended ($99).  You should install this program on the same computer where you have installed the iTunes program that you use to control your iPad.  The seller does not allow multiple installations.

, When you install the DAISYtoEPUB program on a desktop computer, you may experience problems with Java, which is required for the program to work.  For example, you may see the error message:  “Could not create the Java virtual machine.”  To fix this problem, you may have to increase the amount of RAM allocated to Java to 1024 MB, rather than the 512 MB suggested in this footnote., To download books from Bookshare, use the computer where you have installed DAISYtoEPUB.  Make sure that you are not logged in to Bookshare on any other devices.  Then go to bookshare.org and log in.  Type the name of the author or book that you would like to download in the search box at the top of the page and push Enter.  When you see a book that you like, click on the Download button to the far right of that title.  After the file finishes downloading, you should find it in the Downloads folder on your computer.

, To convert books to the EPUB format, open the DAISYtoEPUB program.  When this program opens, you will see 3 boxes to complete.  The second box is already completed for you, and you don’t need to change it, if you don’t mind storing EPUB books in the My Documents folder.  To complete the first box, click the Browse button to the right of the box and find the book that you want to convert, located in the Downloads folder.  If you double-click on this title, both the first and third boxes will get filled in automatically.  Then click on Convert and wait for the file to be converted to EPUB and stored in the My Documents folder.

, To do this, start iTunes by clicking on the icon on your laptop’s desktop.  In iTunes, click on File, Add File to Library.  (If you do not see ""File"" in iTunes, click on the tiny black and white box in the extreme upper left corner of the screen, and then click on Add File to Library. Alternatively, you may use Control-B to to make ""File"" visible in the Windows version of iTunes.) Locate the book you want to transfer inside the My Documents folder and double-click on it.  It will be transferred to iTunes.

, To transfer your EPUB books to the iPad, start iTunes and then connect the iPad to your computer.  After awhile, a small icon representing your iPad will appear on the main screen of iTunes, in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  Click on this icon.  In the next screen, click on Books in the list on the left.  On the right side of the screen, make sure you have selected Sync Books, All Books (or at least Selected Books, with your new book checked).  If you make any changes to these settings, sync the iPad again.  After the iPad sync is complete, click on the icon in the upper left corner, next to your iPad’s name, which ejects the iPad.  Then disconnect the iPad and open the iBooks app on the iPad.  You should see your new book listed in iBooks.

, If you find that the horizontal Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen in iBooks has been replaced by a vertical line on the right side of the screen, that means that someone must have accidentally turned on Scrolling View in iBooks. Scrolling View will cause the Progress Bar to appear on the right side of the screen, and this will make it much more difficult for you to turn pages. To correct this problem, click on the AA icon at the top of the screen in iBooks, and then turn off Scrolling View. If you are using only the pillow switch to perform this action, you will now find yourself ""stuck in a box,"" unable to exit the menu that pops up when you click on the AA icon. To get out of this box, see the instructions below.

, If you ever find that clicking on the pillow switch doesn’t do anything at all, make sure that the Tecla Shield has power and is turned on. If that isn't the problem, reboot the iPad by pressing the large Home button on the face of the iPad and the Power button on the side of the iPad together for at least 10 seconds.  After the screen becomes dark, wait another 10-20 seconds or so. If the machine doesn't come back on again by itself, push the iPad’s side Power button briefly to turn it back on.

, When you are in item scanning mode and using iBooks, sometimes you may find yourself stuck inside a box and unable to get out.  You will know that you are stuck inside a box if the highlight only flashes on a single box of text, or if it flashes on one box of text and then on another, but it doesn’t flash on other options on the page, so that you are unable to turn pages.

, To reproduce this condition of being stuck inside a box, so that you may practice how to deal with it, first turn the pillow switch OFF (or turn the screen switch OFF, if you are using a screen switch in Caretaker Practice Mode). You may do this either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control Off.  Next open iBooks and open a book in iBooks.  Notice that when you touch the screen, the Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen will appear and disappear.  When the line is no longer present, turn the pillow switch or the screen switch back ON, either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control On.  You should now find yourself stuck inside a box.

, If you are stuck inside a box, change from item scanning to point scanning.  Carefully select a point near the bottom of the screen, where you know that the Progress Bar (the long thin line) should be, and click on Tap.  The Progress Bar will reappear.

, Next click on an Oval icon and go to the first submenu, where you can change from point scanning back to item scanning.

, Click on Groups Off, if that is being displayed, or on Groups On, if that is being displayed.  That should fix the problem of being stuck inside a box. However, if you now find yourself with Groups Off, that will slow scanning down, and you will probably want to turn Groups On again."

Figure out the poem.,
Mark your poem.,
Look up any words you don't know.,
Consider memorizing the poem.",How to Read Poetry out Loud3," Spend some time getting to know the poem. Read it through several times, and try to tease out its meaning. Some poems have clearer meanings than others, so in some cases, you may only be able to figure out a feeling or tone. Either way, you need to have some understanding of the poem before you are able to read it well.To help figure out the poem, break it down into pieces. Try ciphering out what certain similes mean in connection to the whole.
For example, one famous poem by Langston Hughes, ""Harlem,"" is composed of a series of similes. It starts out with ""What happens to a dream deferred?"" then goes through similes such as ""Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun?"" The simile compares a dream deferred to a raisin, losing all life, becoming shriveled under the heat of the sun.

, Read through the poem, and figure out what needs to be loud or soft, what need to be punched or spoken softly. Look at where you need longer pauses for emphasis. Try to mark all of these instance in your poem, then practice reading with the marked-up poem. You can use different colors if that helps., If you don't know the word, you're not going to understand how it fits into the poem. In addition, you want to make sure you get the pronunciation right, as sound is very important to a poem. Mark the words you don't know, and then spend some time with your dictionary., While it's not necessary to memorize a poem to read it out loud, it can help you find a better rhythm if you memorize it. You'll be able to think about the natural flow of the poem, instead of being worried about what's coming next."

Papaya, ginger, and peppermint chews are all available at health food stores. These items resemble candy and taste good, so your child is more likely to eat it. Read the packaging to determine how many chew your child can eat in a day., Ginger and mint are also available in tea form. These warm beverages work quickly to ease stomach discomfort. Make your child a cup of warm mint or ginger tea. You may add a bit of honey if it helps them to enjoy it. Avoid adding white sugar, as this may aggravate their tummy., Gripe water is a product sold to relieve colic and other tummy troubles in infants, but it can be helpful for older kids too. The main ingredient is fennel oil, which can help ease gas, bloating, or upset stomach. Try to avoid gripe water varieties that contain sweetener (sucrose) or alcohol., Warmth can encourage your child’s stomach muscles to relax, helping to ease the discomfort. Use a traditional heating pad (on low), or warm a cloth in the microwave., With soft hands, rub circles around your child’s stomach. This should provide some comfort, while also encouraging their muscles to relax. Continue this for 5-10 minutes. Avoid moving too quickly or pressing too hard."

Fire the rubber band off your index finger.,
Fire the rubber band off your thumb.,
Use your index finger like a slingshot.,
Make your hand into a gun.",How to Fire a Rubber Band1," The easiest way to fire a rubber band off your finger is by hooking it on the tip of your index finger, pulling it back and lettin' it rip. To fire the band off your index finger:


Place the rubber band on the tip of your index finger, pointing your finger where you want the rubber band to go.
Pull the rubber band back with your other hand, past your raised thumb.
Let go of the rubber band to let it fire, or hook the rubber band onto your thumb.
If you hook it onto your thumb, move your thumb forward and let it slip off to fire.;
, Firing rubber bands off your thumb is a good way of making sure that the band won't catch and snap against the back of your hand when you're firing. You can also get a lot of power out of it. To fire a rubber band off your thumb:


Hook the rubber band around the tip of your thumb, pointing your thumb in the direction you want the rubber band to go.
Point the tip of your thumb forward so it will slip off the end of your thumb easily.
Grab the other end of the rubber band with your other hand, pulling it back as far as it will go.
Release the rubber band with your other hand to let it fire.

, One creative way of firing a rubber band involves using your index finger to create a pivot, from which you can pull the band back and release it with your other fingers. To fire a rubber band this way:


Place your hand with your palm facing up.
Hook each end of the rubber band around your middle finger and thumb.
Use your index finger to stretch the rubber band forward a few inches, pointing it in the direction you want the band to travel, and pulling it tight.
Let the rubber band slip off your middle finger and thumb simultaneously to release it.

, The most-complicated, but also most-classic way of firing a rubber band is by shaping your hand into a gun and wrapping the band around to really let it fly. To fire a rubber band this way:


Make your hand into a gun shape, with your thumb as the hammer and your finger as the barrel. Point your index finger in the direction you want the rubber band to go.
Hook the rubber band around your pinkie, pulling it back toward the inside of your wrist.
Hook the rubber band all the way around your thumb.
Secure it on the very tip of your pointer finger.

Remember that there is no completely safe way to sun tan.,
Keep in mind any medications you are taking.,
Steer clear of tanning beds.,
Refrain from tanning pills.",How to Get a Good Tan when You Are Light Skinned3," Even cautious tanning may lead to health problems down the line. Dermatologists assert that any UV-induced changes to your natural skin tone indicate damage. Be sure to weigh the cosmetic benefits against long-term health risks., Certain medications, such as retinoids and some antibiotics, can dramatically increase your skin's susceptibility to sun damage. Before you tan, carefully read all warning labels and literature for your medications, vitamins, and health supplements. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.If you are taking any unprescribed dietary supplements or herbal medicines, it is very important to do your own independent research. The FDA regulates this class of products much more loosely than conventional drugs. Warning labels are not required, and supplements may actually contain ingredients with different concentrations and even identities than those advertised., Indoor tanning uses high-intensity UV rays that are often too much, especially for fair skin. Although tanning beds are marketed as a safe alternative to natural sunlight, they actually represent a number of added health risks:


Premature aging of the skin.
Blinding eye diseases.Infectious diseases, such as herpes and warts, from improperly-cleaned equipment.

, There are no currently FDA-approved pills for enhancing your skin's color. Tanning pills typically contain the pigment canthaxanthin and are illegal to import and sell within the United States. When ingested in large amounts, this substance commonly causes damage to the eyes, skin, and digestive system. "

Ask for a sample.,
Opt for an organic product.,
Observe the color of the herbs.,
Smell the herbs.,
Make certain that you have a pure product.",How to Buy the Best Herbs1," Regardless of how you are buying herbs, it is a good idea get a small sample to help you evaluate them for quality. Buying from a local herbalist is ideal because you will be able to investigate the herbs in person. If you are buying from an online provider, then ask them to send you a sample so that you can decide if you want to purchase herbs from them.;
, Choose an herb provider that uses organic practices to grow their herbs. Herbs that are grown using conventional methods will be contaminated with pesticides and this may affect the potency and quality of the herbs.


If you are buying herbs online, look for products that are produced using organic, sustainable growing practices as well as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). GMPs are sets of rules and regulations set up by the FDA., Color may help you determine the quality of the herbs you are considering buying.Look at the herbs to see if they are green or brown. Greener herbs are fresher than brownish herbs. A green color also indicates that the herbs have not been exposed to excessive heat.


Check for signs of mold or mildew as well. Mold and mildew may be dark or greyish/whitish and may look dusty., Quality herbs should have a pleasant aroma.Smell your herbs to see if they smell how they are supposed to smell. If there is no smell, then the herbs may have been exposed to heat and this can make them less effective.


Steer clear of any herbs that do not how you expect them to smell. For example, if you buy some peppermint that does not smell minty, then it might be an inferior product or it might not be mint at all.

, Some herbs are expensive, so it is important to make sure that you are getting what you paid for. Inspect the herbs to make sure that they have not been filled with other herbs or with another part of the plant.


For example, if the herb is a flower, then only flowers should be in the bag. If the herb is a root, then you should be looking at a root.

Make your surroundings appealing.,
Clean up your space.,
Turn off electronics when you can.,
Bring nature inside.,
Find a scent you love and spread it throughout your space.,
Invest in a quality mattress and bedding.,
Incorporate tranquil paint colors throughout your space.,
Adjust your thermostat to a temperature that makes you the most comfortable.",How to Create a Relaxing Atmosphere1," When your environment is chaotic, it’s difficult to feel relaxed. Making small changes to your surroundings can help your home feel like a refuge from the chaos, rather than part of it. It’s important to address your space’s visual appeal and cater to your own individual taste.


Even small changes, like rearranging furniture or adding a piece of art, will make your space more visually appealing. Be sure that your furniture fits in the room you place it in. For example, an exceptionally large sofa in a small sitting room will make the space seem cramped and uninviting. Relegate the sofa to a larger space if possible.;
, This is vital to creating a relaxed atmosphere. If you have an especially messy place, start small, with a single space like a desk or closet, and work your way up to larger spaces. This might seem daunting at first, but if you dedicate time each day to working on decluttering, then soon you will be able to reap the benefits of a clean, calming environment.


When you declutter your closet, get rid of any clothing that you don't love or haven't been able to wear within the last year. Unless a particular garment has a sentimental value, bag it up and donate it to a nearby resale shop.
If cleaning and organizing you place seems overwhelming, search online for professional cleaning companies. For a fee, you can pay someone to clean as much or as little of your home as you like. For your own peace of mind, be sure to use a company that performs background checks on their employees.

, Constantly checking emails and social media can generate stress, especially if you are a student or employee who brings your work home with you. Make an effort to unplug in the evenings if you can. Try alternative activities to relax, like reading or taking a hot bath instead of staring at a screen all night.


Unplugging is especially important to do before bedtime, as studies have shown that the blue light emitted from electronic devices can inhibit melatonin production and hurt your sleep quality., Keeping plants or flowers on display de-stresses the atmosphere of your space and helps purify the air. Some great choices include the aloe vera plant, which contains a gel that soothes burns and cuts, or the rubber tree plant, which is great for novice plant owners and has strong air purifying abilities., Avoid scents that are too pungent or overwhelming. Instead, focus on calming scents like lavender, chamomile, or even chocolate, which have been proven to have relaxing effects. Use scent diffusers or candles for subtly incorporating relaxing scents and ambiance.


Scents to generally avoid for relaxation include grapefruit, cinnamon, and peppermint, as these promote alertness and are energizing.

, Nowhere is relaxation more important than your bedroom. Since you will spend roughly one-third of your life in bed, it’s important that your bed and bedding create a relaxing space for you to recharge. Invest in a comfortable mattress and bedding. See this article for suggestions on how to Buy a Mattress.


Be aware that memory foam mattresses are well known for trapping heat. If you tend to feel warm when you sleep, you might want to avoid this type of mattress or invest in a cooling gel mattress-topper designed to offset the trapped heat from the memory foam.

, Shades of blues, greens, and grays all inspire relaxation. Neutrals like ivory and beige are also great choices. Avoid bright, vivid paint colors, which tend to energize rather than relax.

Save vivid paint colors for accent colors on items like pillows or throws, rather than painting entire rooms with them.

, Slightly cool indoor temperatures tend to make a space seem more relaxing. Approximately 68 to 70 degrees is a comfortable indoor temperature. For relaxation for sleeping, go a bit cooler to about 65 degrees for optimal rest."

Use something untraditional for the topper.",How to Decorate a Winter Wedding Cake3," Satin bows look elegant encircling tiers of wedding cake, especially white and cream colored bows. Tuck sprigs of red Christmas berries or rosemary through the center of the bows to complete the seasonal look. If you want a more rustic vibe, use pieces of burlap, lace or twine instead.Wrap gold or red ribbons around the cake for a striped gift-wrap effect.
Strips of silver lace also look festive and wintry., Pearls look stunning on cream frosting and their luminous quality adds to the shimmery snow effect. Use pearls around the base, embed them in the frosting or arrange them on top of the tiers. Incorporate ornamental Christmas balls in complimentary colors for a more seasonal look.


You could use metallic beading in gold or silver to create a gilded, glittery effect. Crystals look lovely, too., Instead of the typical bride/groom topper, go for something seasonal that matches your wedding’s theme. A rustic wedding could have a topper arrangement created out of burlap, fresh herbs and cinnamon sticks. Tiny owl figurines can create a forest-like vibe or tiny snowmen could represent the season.You could also top the cake with an elaborate arrangement of natural materials. Try a combination of pinecones, fresh herbs, twigs, berries, baby’s breath and fresh flowers."

Be careful when using a sharp knife to cut the potatoes. Place the pieces of potato into a large skillet (at least 12-inches in size).








For a healthier breakfast skillet, consider substituting sweet potatoes for the baby potatoes.;
, Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the potatoes in your skillet. Season the potatoes and cover the skillet with a lid. Cook the potatoes over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until they're tender when you poke them with a knife. For seasoning, just sprinkle these over your potatoes and adjust the flavorings to your taste:








Smoked paprika
Garlic powder
Salt
Black pepper
Fresh thyme, stemmed and chopped
Fresh rosemary, stemmed and chopped

, Slice 10 to 14 ounces (283.5 to 396 g) of sausage into 1








You can use any type of sausage that you like. To speed cooking time, choose a sausage that's already fully cooked.

, Heat another large saute pan or skillet over medium heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pan. Once the oil starts shimmering, add your sliced sausage and saute it until it browns. Add the chopped vegetables and cook them until they're tender, about 10 minutes.








For extra flavor, you can add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of maple syrup.

, Consider which of your skillets is larger and transfer the food from the smaller skillet into the larger one. For example, if the skillet that has your sausage and veggies is larger, transfer the potatoes into it and stir them in.








If you're worried your skillet won't hold all of the potatoes, sausage, and cooked vegetables, transfer all of the ingredients to a large mixing bowl to stir them together. You can divide them between your smaller skillets to finish cooking them.

, Determine how many eggs you want to cook in your breakfast skillet. Make a small well for each egg you'll be cooking by scooting aside the potato








Depending on how well you like your eggs cooked, try cooking the breakfast skillet for 8 to 10 minutes. If you'd like to scramble the eggs, just crack them into the skillet and stir them constantly as they cook. It should only take 4 or 5 minutes until they're scrambled and set.
Serve the breakfast skillet with hot sauce, maple syrup, or ketchup.

Compare the estimates from the surveyors you contacted.,
Select a surveyor.,
Allow the surveyor to perform the survey.",How to Get a Land Survey," There are 6 situations in which a land survey should be performed.


Get a survey done if you are buying a new piece of property. The reason is simple: you need to make sure that what you think you're buying is actually what you're buying. Most lenders will require a survey anyway.
Get a survey done if you are constructing anything new on your property. Most zoning ordinances and neighborhood codes will specify a required setback from your property line. If you don't know precisely where your property line is, you won't be able to adhere to this regulation.
Get a survey done if your property has any access easements. All property owners are entitled to access their property, and this often requires getting easements to allow the use of a neighboring land parcel for access. Easements should specify very clearly the centerline and width of any access corridors.
Get a survey done if you are selling your property. Having a current survey on file will greatly improve the marketability of your home. Buyers will be more interested in your property if you give them the confidence that a proper survey has been performed.
Get a survey done if you need to verify the acreage of your property for tax assessments. Your local jurisdiction may require you to have a current survey on file to correctly assess property taxes.
Get a survey done if your neighbor starts building anything new. If you suspect your neighbor is encroaching on your property or violating setback regulations, you need a survey on your own property to initiate any legal action.;
, Have your deed ready, because surveyors will generally not give an estimate unless they have a copy of your deed. Explain the reason why you need a survey and any other concerns you might have.

, Good surveying firms will do their research before providing a bid. Make sure that they've checked for any previous surveys done on your property by government offices or private surveyors. Surveys will cost less if some of the boundaries can be quickly verified through previous surveys.

, When you're happy with a company's bid, sign the contract included with the bid and return it to the company. You will generally have to pay a retainer fee at this point. Make sure that you clearly understand how long it will take the surveyor to complete the survey before contracting with them.

, When the job is done, you should receive a signed certificate from them certifying that the survey has been recorded.

Use warm water and gentle soaps, as harsh skincare products can increase oil production.Some natural gentle soaps include clay- and charcoal-based soaps, black soap, and milk soap. Glycerin soap is also very gentle., Buttermilk contains lactic acid. This will clean your face, and tighten pores. Simply massage it on your face, wait a few minutes, and then rinse it off., Use approximately 2 teaspoons of ground and sifted dry oats. Combine with witch hazel until it has a paste-like consistency. Rub into your skin, and then rinse with warm water. This will help slough off dead skin cells.There are plenty of other recipes for oatmeal masks that can help with oily skin and acne. You can use honey, baking soda, or even avocado for different effects.Witch hazel is a natural toner.It can also help with broken skin, swelling, and bacteria removal., To do so, mix an egg white with honey and a bit of flour (enough to make a paste). Wait for it to dry (about 10 minutes). Rinse with warm water. This is great for reducing oil on your skin, and can even act as an anti-aging agent.You can vary this recipe by using vanilla extract, lemon juice, or yoghurt., Washing too intensely or too many times a day (more than twice), can deplete the natural oils that protect your face from bacteria, which causes acne.

See your physician for a urine ""ACR"" to test your kidney function.The urine ""ACR"" stands for the ""albumin to creatinine ratio."",
Understand that you may receive a ""random"" urine test or a 24-hour test.If you and your doctor opt for a ""random"" sample, you will be asked to submit a one-time urine sample to the lab which can give a snapshot view as to the amount of protein present in your urine at that time.,
Ask your doctor for a ""urinalysis"" to gain additional information about your kidney function.In addition to the more basic test of looking for protein in your urine, a ""urinalysis"" also examines your urine under the microscope checking for any red blood cells, white blood cells, or other unusual things that may be present in your urine.,
See your physician for a blood test to evaluate your kidney function.There are a few different things that can be measured in a blood test that can provide valuable information to your doctor about your kidney function.,
Interpret the significance of your creatinine and eGFR results.Creatinine is a waste product that accumulates in the blood.,
Receive BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine clearance tests.BUN is another waste product that can build up in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning adequately, and is hence used as a potential sign of kidney disease or acute kidney impairment.,
Have your blood pressure measured.In addition to receiving both urine tests and blood tests, if your doctor suspects that you may have a kidney problem (either acute or chronic) it is key that you receive regular blood pressure measurements as well.,
Get tested for diabetes.,
Receive further kidney evaluations as necessary.If your urine and blood tests show evidence of kidney disease, you may need to proceed with further investigation such as imaging and/or a kidney biopsy.",How to Test Kidney Function," Albumin is a protein that is normally present in your blood, and that should generally NOT be filtered in excess quantities through your kidneys into your urine. It is for this reason that protein in your urine (such as albumin) can be indicative of kidney disease.


If your urine ACR comes back ""positive,"" the test should be repeated for confirmation.
You need at least 3 measurements of elevated protein (albumin) in your urine over 3 or more months in order for it to be diagnostic of chronic (ongoing) kidney disease.;
, Technically, the 24-hour urine test is more accurate than just providing one sample, as it allows your doctor to calculate the average amount of protein in your urine over a full day. However, it is also more cumbersome as you will need to collect ALL of your urine over the course of 24 hours, every time you go.


It is important to discuss the pros and cons of each option with your doctor.
A random urine sample may be sufficient to diagnose protein in your urine.
If your results are borderline, however, you may be asked to complete the 24-hour urine test for a more detailed assessment of the amount of protein in your urine over the course of a full day.

, If your urine is positive for red blood cells or white blood cells when the doctor looks under the microscope, this is oftentimes a sign of kidney damage.


Blood cells are normally too large to be filtered through the kidneys.
Therefore, their presence in the urine can indicate problems with the kidneys' filtering system that would allow such large cells to get through.

, These can all be measured via the same blood test. They include: the creatinine, the eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), the BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and the creatinine clearance.


The results you receive on these blood tests will be very effective at testing your kidney function.
They will indicate to your physician whether there are any signs of kidney disease - either acute (short-term) problems, or signs of chronic and ongoing kidney troubles.

, With normal healthy kidneys, the creatinine waste product is effectively removed from the blood via the kidneys which filter it out through the urine. When you have kidney disease, however, the rate at which creatinine is filtered and removed from your blood slows, leading to a build-up of this waste product that can subsequently be detected on blood tests.


The purpose of measuring creatinine is that it provides insight into your kidney function, and also allows your doctor to calculate the eGRF (the estimated glomerular filtration rate).
The eGFR is not a quantity that is directly ""measured"" via the blood test; rather, it is calculated (approximately) based on your creatinine reading.
The calculated value for eGRF that your doctor comes up with based on your creatinine results is another important way to evaluate kidney function, because it gives insight as to the rate at which the glomeruli in your kidneys are filtering blood.
A creatinine level between 0.5-1.5mg/dL is considered normal in men, and 0.6-1.2mg/dL is considered normal in women.An eGFR above 60mLs/min/1.73 square meters is considered indicative of normal and healthy kidney function (as long as you do not have other signs or symptoms of kidney disease). An eGFR below that is diagnostic of kidney disease.

, The downside to BUN is that this waste product may also be elevated in other disease states, such as for patients with congestive heart failure, or in the midst of a heart attack or in shock. The benefit to BUN, however, as opposed to simply using the creatinine waste product measurement, is that an elevated BUN is less likely to have false positive results than an elevated creatinine.


The creatinine clearance rate is when the creatinine measurement in your blood is compared to the creatinine measurement in your 24-hour urine test.
Your physician can then determine the rate at which creatinine is being filtered from your blood through your kidneys into your urine.

, This is because high blood pressure may contribute to kidney disease. If your blood pressure is high, talk to your doctor about dealing with that as soon as possible.


A high blood pressure is defined as a reading over 140 systolic (the top number) or over 90 diastolic (the bottom number).
Generally, your doctor will perform a few blood pressure measurements over time in order to get your average (and to ensure that he or she does not diagnose you with high blood pressure based on just one blood pressure reading, but rather, based on several).
There are several treatments available for high blood pressure (medically called ""hypertension"") if you are found to have it.
Getting your blood pressure under control will likely have a beneficial effect on improving your kidney function, as well.

, It is important to understand that diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.If you have diabetes, you need to be screened for kidney disease at least once a year, even if you have no signs or symptoms that are suspicious of kidney disease. This is because there is a very strong correlation between diabetes (particularly diabetes with continually uncontrolled blood sugar levels) and the development of kidney disease as a complication of elevated blood sugar levels.


To get tested for diabetes, you can have your glucose levels as well as your HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c, a long-term measure of your sugar levels) measured via a blood test.
Following through with all recommended treatments for diabetes, if you are indeed diagnosed with it, is key to delaying the development of kidney disease and/or to preventing it from becoming worse, if you already have it.

, Directly looking at your kidneys, either with an imaging test or with a biopsy, can help your doctor to diagnose the underlying cause of your kidney problems, if this remains unknown.


Imaging tests and/or biopsies are generally reserved for more severe cases where the underlying cause of your kidney disease remains unknown.
These additional investigations may be key in helping your doctor create an appropriate treatment plan.

Ask your doctor, psychologist, or specialist for referrals.,
Ask friends, family, and colleagues.,
Search for certified coaches online.,
Narrow down your search.,
Interview potential candidates.,
Consider the cost.",How to Use an ADHD Coach1," One way to find an ADHD coach is to ask your doctor or psychologist to refer you to a reputable coach in the area. You can also approach your local chapter of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) and ask if they know of any ADHD coaches in the area, or who will coach online or over the phone., If you have a friend, family member, or colleague who has used ADHD coaching, then this can also be a good way to get a referral. Just be sure that you feel comfortable asking the person and that they will likely be receptive to you asking.

For example, if the person has talked openly with you about seeing an ADHD coach, then they will probably be willing to share. However, if you heard from someone else that the person sees an ADHD coach and the person is not open about it, then you might not want to ask them.
If you decide to ask, try saying something like, “I am looking for an ADHD coach and I remember you talking about seeing one. Would you recommend your coach?”

, You can also search online for an ADHD coach. Organizations that certify coaches such as the ADHC Coach Institute (IAAC) and the International Coach Federation (ICF) will provide online directories of certified coaches. Search through the directory and read up on the education and specializations of each coach.You should also determine if you want a coach that specializes in ADHD coaching or just a general life coach. A specialized ADHD coach is not necessary, but they may have a better understanding of your situation.
The most important thing about choosing a coach is finding someone who fits with your personality.

, Once you have searched through the directory of coaches or received a few referrals, you will want to narrow down the search. Read through online testimonials. This will help you get a better understanding of the coaching style and how they interact with clients. You can also ask yourself the following questions to help you decide on a coach:Are in-person coaching sessions important to me? If yes, then you will want to find a coach who is geographically close and offers regular in-person sessions.
Do I want a coach that specializes in certain areas? Aside from having a working knowledge of ADHD, you may want a coach that focuses on helping with time management, organization, parenting, work, family life, etc.
Do I want a coach with a lot of energy or someone who is more subdued?
What hours am I available to meet with or visit with a coach? Do I need daily direction, or are weekly visits easier for my schedule?

, Once you have narrowed down your list to approximately 3 to 5 potential coaches, you should interview the candidates to see if any of them are a fit for you. Most coaches will offer 15-30 minutes of their time, free of charge, to allow you to get to know them. If any of the coaches on the list will not allow an interview, you should probably cross them off the list. Here are a few questions to ask while interviewing potential ADHD coaches:What is your educational and certification background?
How many clients with ADHD have you coached?
Explain the type of coaching that you are looking for (i.e. time management) and ask ""Have you have ever coached someone with that specific issue?""
How long are coaching sessions?
What is the cost and payment structure?
How do you approach coaching?

, Coaching is typically not covered by insurance policies. As a result, you will need to consider the cost when you are deciding on an ADHD coach. Coaching sessions can range in price from pro bono sessions all the way to $1,500 per month. Most coaches cost around $300-$600 a month.Some coaches may expect you to sign up and pay for a minimum number of sessions up front. This is because some patients may lose interest after the first few sessions and discontinue the treatment.
If you pay for the treatment in advance, you are more likely to follow through with the coaching sessions.
If you are in great need of coaching, then take a close look at your budget to see what you can eliminate from it to free up some money for coaching. You may even consider taking a part-time job or asking for more hours at your current job to pay for coaching.

Check for the right consistency before you cook the tortillas.,
Decide whether you want to press all your dough before you cook or press as you cook.,
Heat cast-iron pan over medium high heat.,
Brush the tortillas lightly with oil and place on the pan to cook.,
Repeat process with remaining dough.",How to Make Your Own Tortillas2," This recipe makes 24 tortillas. Here are the ingredients you'll need to make tasty corn tortillas:


2 cups masa harina (preferably Maseca brand)
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

, Make sure salt is evenly distributed in the masa.

,, The dough should have the consistency of Play-Doh: springy and firm but also slightly dry.


Add more water by tablespoons if the dough is too dry; add more masa if the dough is too wet.







, Remember that corn tortillas are traditionally smaller than flour tortillas.


Use a tortilla press lined with plastic wrap for even, more uniform-looking tortillas.






If you don't have a tortilla press, use a rolling pin for more artisanal tortillas.







, If the dough crumbles, it is too dry — add more water. If the dough sticks to the plastic on the press, or to the rolling pin, it is too wet — add more masa.


This will be your final chance to get the consistency right before cooking.







, The tortillas won't take long to cook, so you may want to have them all pressed before you begin cooking. If you're working with a tortilla press, you should have enough time to press tortillas while you cook.

, Cast iron pans distribute heat evenly and quickly, so they are best for cooking tortillas, but any non-stick pan will do the job in a pinch.

, Cook 1-2 minutes on one side, or until slightly charred and edges begin to curl. Flip onto opposite side and cook for 15 more seconds. Remove from heat.


If using a cast-iron pan, it's okay to cook more than one tortilla at a time.







, Keep the tortillas warm by wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel if serving immediately.

Turn automated renewals on or off.",How to Manage Your Magazine Subscriptions," If you want to start managing magazine subscriptions better, start with a list. You can use pen and paper or make a list on your computer. Write down every magazine subscription you have.Next to each magazine, write down how much is due each month for the subscription. If some of your magazines have yearly fees, write down the yearly fee instead.
Next, write down the date when each bill is due.
This may take awhile, as you'll have to look up information for each subscription. Make sure to carve out a chunk of your day to make a detailed list.;
, Re-order your list by due date. Place the subscription fees that are due earlier in the month towards the top of the list, and the ones due later in the month towards the bottom. This will give you a sense of when everything is due, and give you a heads up about which payments are due sooner., Try to pick days around when you get paid. For example, say you get paid the first and the fifteenth of each month. You could pay half the subscriptions on the 2nd, and the other half on the 16th. If you mark these dates in your calendar at the beginning of each month, you'll be less likely to forget a payment.Remember to consult your list. Always pay subscription fees due earlier in the month sooner than those due later in the month. You don't want to end up with a late fee.

, You can use your phone or computer to set up an alert system for yourself. This can be particularly helpful if you're forgetful by nature. You can talk to your bank about an online bill pay reminder. You can also set an alarm on your phone's calendar for when certain bills are due. If you have a lot of subscriptions to track, this can really help you stay on top of things., You can call customer service or check online for automated bill options. If you subscribe to multiple magazines, the easiest way to manage subscriptions is to have payments automatically deducted from a checking account. If you can do automatic payments, this will help you make sure you never miss a bill.You may want to mark on your calendar when monthly payments are due even when paying automatically. This will help you keep track of how much money is in your bank account at any given time.
However, be careful to keep track of automated payments. Make sure you're not overpaying, or paying for a subscription you already cancelled. You should also always make sure you have enough money in your account when dealing with automatic payments.

, While tracking bills, you should make sure you're receiving all the magazines you subscribe to. If you notice you missed an issue, you should contact the magazine's customer service immediately to report the issue.


You may be able to report a missing magazine online, if you have an online account where you manage things like renewals and bills.If you don't have an online account, you can also call customer service to request your magazine be reissued.

, If you are moving, call the magazine's customer service and notify them of your upcoming move. Do this at least a month in advance of your relocation so that the magazine can be routed to your new address.


An address change can sometimes be done online if you have an online account with the magazine.However, you may also need to call customer service if you don't manage subscriptions online.

, A budget can help you decide which subscriptions to keep and which subscriptions to cut. As you work on cutting back on expenses, make a budget to guide your decisions.Write down how much money you bring in each month. Then, make a list of all your necessary expenses such as rent, food, and other bills.
Subtract your totally monthly expenses from your total monthly income. This will give you your disposable income for the month. Think about how much of this money you want to spend on magazine subscriptions.

, Be honest with yourself. Are you really getting your money's worth for all of your subscriptions? Comb through your list of magazine subscriptions and identify any magazines you don't really read anymore. You should cut any unnecessary subscriptions. This will save you money, and make managing subscriptions easier.How often do you really read some of your subscriptions? You may feel like you should read something like Time Magazine or Newsweek, but maybe you're just not using those resources anymore. You may be turning the internet for your news instead.
If you can't remember the last time you read a magazine cover to cover, call customer service and cancel your subscription. You'll save yourself some money and have less to keep track of in regards to monthly bills.

, How much of a given magazine's content could you find online? If you subscribe to an online version of a magazine, is that subscription cheaper than a print one? When looking for ways to cut costs, see if you can find cheap alternatives to print magazines.Many magazines and newspapers post the bulk of their content online. At least some of it is available to view for free. If you don't read a magazine terribly extensively, making use of free online content may be enough for you.
You can also look into subscribing to a magazine's digital content. Some magazines may offer cheaper subscriptions if you're not getting a print magazine.

, Even if you read all your magazines, think about whether this is really how you want to spend your money. How much pleasure do you get out of your magazines? Are they necessary to work or school? If you're not truly making the most of your subscriptions, consider cutting back. This will make managing bills less of a headache and free up some income., If you're using Newsstand on an Apple device, like an iPhone, you can check your subscriptions easily. If you're unsure how many subscriptions you have, simply click ""Settings"" on your iPhone or iPad.From there, click ""iTunes and App Store"" and then tap your Apple ID near the top of the page. Then, click ""View Apple ID"" on the pop up menu that will appear. If necessary, enter your password.
Look for the heading ""Subscriptions."" Click ""manage"" under this heading. You should see a list of subscriptions there.

, If there's a subscription in Newsstand you no longer use, canceling is easy. Once you've pulled up a list of your subscriptions, click on the subscription you want to cancel. From there, you will be taken to a screen where you have the option to cancel or otherwise modify the subscription. If you're not interested in continuing the subscription, you can easily cancel on this screen., In Newsstand, you have the option of automatically renewing a subscription.

Scrub your elbows.,
Moisturize your skin after scrubbing.,
Wear sunscreen.",How to Get Rid of Dark Elbows2," Scrubbing your elbows helps to remove dry, flaky skin cells which become trapped in the elbow creases and causing skin to have a darker appearance.


Use a loofah or washcloth to apply with exfoliating shower gel to remove excess dead skin cell your elbows, .
Alternatively, you can make your own sugar scrub by mixing 2 parts sugar (white or brown) and 1 part oil (almond, coconut, or olive).
Just remember not to scrub too hard or too frequently, as this may hinder natural oil production and cause your skin to produce extra cells. This can make your elbows even darker. Scrub gently just once or twice a week.
Be patient and you will soon notice a big difference.

, Dry skin causes skin to darken, so remember to keep your elbows moisturized!


Moisturize after each shower or bath (as hot water can act to remove natural oils from your skin), before you go to bed at night, and before you leave the house in the morning. For best results, use lotions which contain shea butter, jojoba oil. or olive oil.
A heavy duty treatment is to apply a thick layer of petroleum jelly, coconut oil, or pure shea butter directly to your elbows before bed, then cover with a ""sock sleeve"" fashioned by cutting the foot of cotton tube socks. It is best to leave the protective sleeve on throughout the night, if you are able. Doing so allows you to apply a massive amount of moisturizer to your elbows without ruining your sheets. Additionally, the sock sleeve helps retain your body heat and liquefy the moisturizer, thereby assisting the absorption by your skin.

, Sun exposure can cause damage skin and make the skin on elbows and knees darker, so it's important to apply sunscreen before all outdoor excursions and activities.


Harmful UV rays are present even when it's cloudy or raining, so you should make a point to wear sunscreen all year round. It might even be a good idea to make sunscreen application part of your morning routine.

Find out if this information is online.,
Get the property ID number.,
Be prepared to pay a fee.,
Fill in the required information.",How to Find a Deed Online2," A lot of counties don't put information about the deed itself online, and this is even true of counties that put tax assessor's records online. The most important information the deed itself will show (that the tax assessor's records won't) is who held the deed before the current owner and what kind of deed they had. Unless a person is making sure that a title is clear, this information is of limited use to the general public.The government entity that keeps these records is usually called the ""county recorder"" or ""county register of deeds."" However, ""recorder of deeds,"" ""deeds registrar,"" and ""deeds registry"" are also common. If you find one of these, there's a good chance your records are online. Again, don't hesitate to call and ask if this information is online. If you are unable to find a website for the relevant county recorder, try using one of these private land record indexes:

http://www.realmarketing.com/county_recorders/county_recorders.htm
https://www.courthousedirect.com/
http://publicrecords.onlinesearches.com/Land-Records-and-Deeds.htm
https://uslandrecords.com/



, Remember, you can find this in the tax assessor's record, sometimes referred to as the parcel number or the recording number. Many county recorders do not make the primary record of deeds by address, because things like street names can change quickly and unpredictably. When this type of deed information is online at all, it is usually searchable by book/page number, by property ID number, or by sellers' and buyers' names. Property ID is usually the most reliable and easiest way to search, because it is less prone to problems like misspellings of names and streets. , Whether you use a county records website or a private record search site, there is often a fee for searching--especially if you want to search by address. Some land record or Deed search sites may charge a one time account fee and others may charge per search or per record. These fees range in cost from a few dollars for governmental websites to ten and twenty dollars per search for some of the private websites., Once you have located a land record database and created an account, fill in as much information as possible, including the address of the property, owner’s name, or Property ID and run a search. If you get too many results, try narrowing your search by adding more information. If you get too few results, try broadening the search using wildcards or by providing less information.

Gather a notebook and writing utensil.,
Track the location of frozen food in your fridge.,
Chart your observations to find cold spots.",How to Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge1," The main problem with cold spots is that they're invisible, which makes them easy to forget. Having a notebook and writing utensil handy in the kitchen will give you the opportunity to make a log of freezing.


You might find it even easier to remember this if you use a magnetic pen/notepad. This way, when you look at the fridge, you'll be reminded about cold spots.
Your fridge may have a few cold spots. To hone in on the location of these, you may want to draw a simple diagram of the shelves of your fridge and mark potential cold spots.;
, Location is the key element you'll need to track to find cold spots. The location of cold spots is usually consistent, so by tracking frozen food in your notebook, you'll be identifying cold spots.You should observe freezing in your fridge for two weeks for the most accurate cold spot identification.
Various factors, including the amount of food in your fridge, can influence freezing and give you false results. More observations will provide more reliable data., Now that you have a log of where food freezes in your fridge, you should be able to easily determine cold spots. Areas where food has consistently frozen are where you have cold spots in your fridge.


Even after finding the cold spots in your fridge, you might still forget where they are located from time to time. Mark these spots with a visible piece of tape, like a colored piece of painters tape.

Shake hands during an introduction.,
Extend a hand for greetings and goodbyes.,
Keep other customs in mind.,
Understand unique handshake variations.",How to Shake Hands3," Many people consider it polite to shake hands during introductions. Therefore, it’s usually a good idea to extend a hand whenever you meet someone for the first time. If someone else is introducing you, wait for them to finish speaking before shaking someone’s hand. While you’re shaking hands, offer a greeting such as:


“Hi, I’m Jane. It’s nice to meet you!”
“Nice to meet you, I’m Jeremy.”
“It’s a pleasure.”
“Hi, how’re you doing?”

, If you’re close friends with someone and don’t usually shake hands, it would be awkward to try. However, depending on the formality of the situation, it may be appropriate to shake hands when greeting or saying goodbyes. Some examples of appropriate situations include:


Greeting an older person or family member
Greeting someone in a professional setting
When arriving at or leaving a nice party
When you haven’t seen a friend in a while, Most Western countries use a firm handshake as a greeting. However, there are many countries around the world where there are different ways to politely show respect. If you’re traveling in a foreign country or meeting up with foreign friends, research the greeting etiquette ahead of time. For example:


In Russia, men shake hands with other men but kiss women’s hands.
In South Korea, the senior person initiates the handshake. Use a soft grip while shaking hands.
In Morocco, only people of the same gender can shake hands.
In Turkey, firm handshakes are considered rude. Instead, use a soft grip.
In China, always greet the oldest person first. Bow slightly while shaking their hand. , If you’re a part of an organization, you may need to learn a special handshake to subtly identify yourself to other members. Similarly, you can use popular handshake variations to show that you’re a part of particular cultural group. For example, many people use the homie handshake when greeting close friends. Some other examples include:


The Freemason handshake. This handshake is top secret and used by Freemasons to identify other members of their group.
The Scout handshake. Both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts shake hands with their left hands when greeting other scouts.The Parent Trap handshake. This handshake, popular with movie buffs, is from the movie Parent Trap.

, Garlic is a food that also has antifungal properties. Applying garlic slices to your ringworm may help clear the infection.Peel a clove of garlic and slice into thin sections. Place the thin slices of garlic onto your ringworm and cover with a bandage.Wear the bandage and garlic slices overnight. Keep doing this until your ringworm clears., Apple cider vinegar is another food with certain medical properties. Dabbing apple cider vinegar onto your ringworm for a few days may remove it from your skin.Moisten a cotton ball or pad with apple cider vinegar and dab it directly on to the affected area.Apply the apple cider vinegar 3-5 times per day for 1-3 days., Some people suggest making a paste with salt and vinegar and apply it to your ringworm.

, Aluminum salts, such as an aluminum chloride 10% soIution or aluminium acetate, are known for their anti-perspirant effects. They may blocks sweat production and help alleviate ringworm.:


Mix one part of the solution with 20 parts water.
The solution shall be applied for 6 to 8 hours. It is advisable to apply the solution overnight because sweat production is lowest at nighttime.
The solution should be washed off before excessive sweating begins. Repeat this procedure until the ringworm heals.
You can get aluminum salts at most pharmacies.

, Good hygiene is integral to preventing ringworm and treating it. From washing your hands to only using your own personal items, simple measures of good hygiene can help you heal this fungal infection, keep it from spreading to others, and may help keep you from being re-infected., Ringworm comes from a parasites that feed on skin cells on the outer layer of your skin.By showering daily and washing your hands frequently, you may be able to prevent ringworm.Use a mild cleanser to wash skin or a simple hand soap to keep your hands clean after using the bathroom or touching shared surfaces.If using a shower in a gym or other type of locker room, wear shower shoes to keep from contracting ringworm on your feet or other area., If you have ringworm on your scalp, use an antifungal shampoo such as Nizoral or ketoconazole.

Wearing clothing appropriate to the weather can keep you from sweating and promoting the conditions that lead to ringworm.In the summer, wear soft and lightweight clothing. Cotton is a good option that will allow your skin to breathe.Layer your clothing in winter. If you get too hot or start to sweat, this can make it easier to remove items of clothing without getting too cold. Merino wool is a good option for winter that can keep you warm and dry."

Wait for a decision.",How to Establish Residency," Most states have their own rules for determining residency, and most colleges and universities will only consider you a resident if you meet the rules set by the state the school is in.Residency requirements are usually stated within the state statute. Look for the statute online. If you are unable to find it, the university registrar should be able to tell you what the residency requirements are.
Note that most requirements for residency are the same from state to state, so following the generic guidelines will typically be enough. You should still find out if there are any differences for your state, though.;
, The burden of proof will either lie with the applicant or the applicant's parent based on whether or not the applicant is still legally dependent on that parent.


Dependents must still be under the age of 24 before the end of the calendar year arrives.
Additionally, the student must rely on the parent financially to be considered a dependent of that parent, but that parent does not necessarily need to claim the student as a dependent on his or her taxes.
Students who are independent must prove presence, intent, and financial independence by themselves. Students who are dependent will need to prove the presence and intent of the parents they reside with. When a student's parents are divorced, residency must be proven for the parent who resides with and financially supports that student.

, You or the parent you are dependent upon must reside within the state for a full calendar year before residency can be granted.Some states have a different time requirement. For instance, Alaska requires proof of physical presence for two full calendar years, while Arkansas only requires physical presence within the state for six months.
This time requirement may also vary based on whether you are dependent or independent. For example, Nebraska does not have a minimum time for dependent students, but independent students must prove that they have been physically present in the state for at least one year.

, You or your parents must also demonstrate your intention to remain in the state on a long-term basis.


Essentially, you need to prove that you intend to remain in the state as a resident throughout and beyond the school year.
This requirement may vary based on your dependency status. In some cases, a student who intends to remain in the state may still qualify for residency even if the parent moves out of state.

, Many states require independent students to provide proof of their financial independence.


This is not a requirement that dependent students need to worry about.
Note that none of the proof you provide indicating financial independence may conflict with your proof of presence or intent.

, In addition to proving residency in the state of your university, you must also have no residential ties to any other state.As a general rule, any type of document that can be used to prove residency in the state of your university can also be used to prove residency in another state. Any record indicating that you have recently applied for residency in another state will also work against you.

, Even though some private documents may show that you have been present in the state for the past year, the most effective documents will be those that are tied to the state or federal government.


The most common forms of government-issued proof include:

A voter registration card
Registration with Selective Service in the state.
A filed ""Declaration of Domicile"" form with the county clerk
State and federal income tax returns
High school diploma from a school within the state


Activities showing that you are regularly present within the state might help as supporting evidence but should not be relied upon completely. Such evidence most often includes memberships to local organizations and club

, Proof of intent is less objective, but in general, any document showing that you are establishing a life within the state can be used to help prove your intent.Common examples include:

State driver's license
Vehicle registration within the state
State hunting and/or fishing license
Local bank account
Local library card
License of marriage or divorce within the state
Utility bills from within the state
Proof of state-aided health or welfare


Owning a home or renting an apartment within the state may help, but since many people own vacation homes out of state, some colleges won't accept this as proof. Only provide this proof if it somehow demonstrates that the home you own in the state is your principal home.Similarly, proof of employment within the state may also help, but some people work in a state they do not live in. Some universities may accept records of full-time employment, but others will not.

, If you need to prove financial independence when establishing residency, you will need to satisfy at least one requirement demonstrating your independence.


In most states, you can be considered independent if you are at least 24 years old by the end of the calendar year.
If you are a single undergraduate student who has not been claimed as a dependent by anyone for at least two years, and can demonstrate self-sufficiency through lease agreements or similar documents, you can usually be considered independent, as well.
You may also be considered financially independent if you are married, a veteran of the U.S. military, a ward of the court, a legal orphan, or responsible for legal dependents other than a spouse., If you have legal documents to prove that you are a resident within another state, they may cause your university to reject your claim of residency for the university's state.


Evidence that can be particularly damaging includes:Failure to pay state income tax
Failure to obey any law that applies to permanent residents of the state
Employment in another state, especially a non-bordering state
Ownership of a home in another state
Extended absence from the state, excluding absences required of military members



, In most states, residency status will be granted or denied by the university. As such, you will need to complete the university's residency application.


Fill out the form accurately and completely. Missing or inaccurate information will delay the process and may prevent your claim of residency from being accepted.
In some cases, both you and your parents (or custodial parent) may need to sign the application.
Make sure that you submit the form before the due date established by your university.

, You'll need at least two government-issued documents establishing residency, and at least one of these documents must satisfy any time limit established by the state.


There is no such thing as having too many documents proving residency. Submit all of the proof you have, just in case one document gets rejected.

, Some of these documents might be government-issued, while others won't be.


Regardless of who issued the document, it is recommended that you provide every possible document proving your intent. Since intent is more subjective than physical presence, you will need even more proof to defend this claim.

, If you are an independent student, you will also need to provide at least one document proving your financial independence when you submit your application.


Even if you proved financial independence on your admissions application or on previously submitted financial aid forms, you should still submit your proof again when attempting to establish residency.

, After submitting your application and proof, you must wait for the tuition classification officer to make a decision. Most colleges and universities will inform you of their decision when it has been made.


The decision is only binding at that particular university. If one university denies your claim of residency, it is possible that another university within the same state may grant your claim.
In some cases, you might be able to appeal the decision with that college or university. There usually won't be a way to appeal the decision to a power beyond that educational institution, however.

When you are done, rinse it out with solution and let your case air dry.Some people contend that boiling your case is the best weekly cleaning method.

Don't take it personally.,
Consider the reasons why people tend to unfollow.,
Concentrate on the quality of the experience rather than on aiming for the huge numbers.,
Check your new follows.,
Enjoy Twitter.",How to Cope With Unfollows on Twitter," This is rule number one, no matter what. Twitter is a social networking site, not a family get-together or a competition. People come and go as easily as visitors to a fun fair. It's not personal, it does happen, and will continue to happen. Be realistic and relaxed about it.;
, It can help your understanding about the site's ebb and flow mentality by understanding the wide range of possible reasons for unfollows. Some of the reasons include:


Disinterest in the topics and information that you're tweeting.
Feeling overwhelmed by too many tweets from you, or in general (known as over-tweeting).
Lack of a genuine follow from them in the first place; they hooked you and then they disappear, hoping you won't notice.
You might have offended someone unintentionally, such as by tweeting a saying from someone that follower detests, or by tweeting to another follower that the un-follower doesn't like; it can be as petty as that, so all the more reason not to take it personally
They discover that they don't fancy your perspective, your politics, your religion, your ideas about the world; welcome to difference and the inability of some people to cope with that. It's still them and not you! It's just a bad fit.
You might be using too much of another language - although your proficiency in Spanish and Russian might thrill you and draw in some new followers, it can equally confuse and lose other followers. But don't let that constrain what makes tweeting fun for you!
You took a long break from updating. Well, really, whose fault is that when other followers' interest in you wanes?! Some people actively remove inactive tweeters.
Some people find that over time, the initial thrill of thousands of followers wears off and they do a cull to keep only those followers they feel most attached to. If that doesn't include you, it's not to be worried about. It is just how each follower's focus on the site evolves. After all, we can really only follow a ""tribe"" of around 150 people before it gets too hard to keep up.
Some people follow to get theme tweets (for example, about current news, the environment, a political event, etc.), whilst others are perfectly happy with an ever-changing eclectic mix. You can't please both types of followers and if you start being eclectic after being theme-driven or vice versa, or you suddenly switch themes, expect to lose some followers who got used to you being one way rather than the other. Although this can be the kiss of death on a blog, on Twitter it will usually mean merely some reshuffling of your followers but you should be ready for that.
Overdoing a personal @ conversation that leaves out other followers and goes on and on. On the one hand, it's nice to see that you're interacting directly but on the other hand, this carries the risk of making others feel left out and bored with your exchange. Use direct messages for lengthy personal interaction and get their email address!
People change. They grow up, they get jaded, they have exams, they change opinions, they change jobs, they get fed up with tweeting, etc. And that can be enough to cause them to unfollow you. In this case, it's just not personal!

, Many Twitter users are trying to raise interest in their ""get rich quick"" schemes through affiliate marketing schemes, or via their own sites that carry pay-per-click ads which they hope you'll pounce on. A lot of them are really deluded about the ad revenue they think they'll draw in and overdo the tweeting. That's part and parcel of business outreach but if it displeases you, then don't follow these types of tweets in the first place. It is far better to have a core bunch of followers whose material you really appreciate and who, in turn, really appreciate your tweets.


Related to this is being honest about your own unfollowing: most of us unfollow on occasion or even regularly, so we must accept that others will do likewise. On the whole, there are few Twitter users able to keep up with the thousands of followers. If they are, it leaves you wondering how, unless they're being paid to do it.

, On the whole, for those going out, there will be equal numbers coming in. Do this check over a period of days rather than minutes or hours, otherwise you'll risk feeling deflated if you're setting stock in balancing followers and unfollows. Try logging off for a bit and come back to find that people have found you in your absence. Treasure that and let it balance out the unfollows.

, It is what it is and nothing more. It is not your local social function, it is not a party, and it is not a performance assessment despite the barrage of nonsense about having huge numbers of followers. It's a place to come and go and to share information. Enjoy it and leave the worry about people ceasing to converse with you at real life functions. In which case, it's time to brush up on your face-to-face social skills!

Seek peer counseling.,
Rely on those who love you.,
Stay in touch with your disabilities advisor.",How to Succeed in School with Bipolar Disorder3," Look for support groups and counseling services that involve your peers who are affected by bipolar disorder. You might receive tips on how to get through obstacles and challenges you are experiencing in school. Meeting others who also have the same disorder as you may help you feel like you’re not alone and could stop you from becoming isolated if the depression starts to become too much.


Talk to your school counselor or contact the National Alliance on Mental Health Illness to find a support group in your area., Stay in touch with your family and friends regarding your condition. In addition, allow them to help, whether it is contacting your instructors when you have a problem or allowing them to clean and shop for you. Don’t feel bad about accepting help from those around you: they are doing it because they love you, and it allows you to focus on staying healthy.


If you are uncomfortable having your parent step up as your advocate, however, you’ll need to address the situation directly. Let them know that you appreciate the help, but it is overwhelming and preventing you from being able to stay focused on your health and school responsibilities., Visit the disability center at your school to document your illness. Doing so potentially allows you to connect with an advisor who can stay in contact with you to ensure you are maintaining your health.


Plus, if you’re having problems, the advisor may be able to help you speak with your instructors about what is going on."

Evaluate your progress.",How to Choose a Marriage Counselor," The first step in finding a marriage counselor is to see which counselors practice in your area. You can look up therapists in your local phone book, by searching online, or by using a reputable therapist database, such as Psychology Today's Find a Therapist page.Online databases let you search by area, by specialty, and by accepted insurance plans.
You can also ask your primary care physician for recommendations/referrals. If you trust your primary doctor, it's probably safe to trust her recommendations.If any trustworthy friends or family members have gone through marriage counseling, you might consider asking them for recommendations. However, you may not wish to do this if you don't want others to know you're seeking counseling.
A licensed marriage counselor will have the title Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), but you can speak to a counselor that is not an LMFT and has relevant experience.
While a regular counselor or psychologist may have experience working with couples, it's important to find a therapist who has the specialized experience that you need. Ask the counselor about her training and credentials. Additionally, you should should ask which area of couples therapy she specializes — such as marriage counseling after infidelity.;
, Once you've found some counselors in your area, you should look up where each counselor practices and how you would get there. Depending on where you live, commuting from one side of town to the other (or even the next town over) might be very difficult. You may also want to factor in modes of transportation. If you do not own a car and rely on public transit, check a transit map to see how close to each counselor you can get, as well as how long that commute would take., Some counselors work within the usual 9:00 to 5:00 workday hours, which could make it difficult to meet if you work a job with rigid hours. Many counselors work on weekends or later in the day to accommodate working patients, although depending on your schedule that may be even less convenient.


If you're signing up for marriage counseling, you want to ensure that you and your partner will be able to make it to every session.
Choose a counselor whose practice hours coincide with your (and your partner's) schedule., A big factor in any medical treatment may be the costs associated with seeing a doctor, and therapy is no different. If you have health insurance, check with a representative from your insurance company to see if your plan covers counseling. You should also look into the estimated cost of counseling, both with insurance (if your plan covers it) and without.Check with your insurance company if counseling/therapy is covered. You may only be covered for therapists within a specified network or practice.
Ask the counselor you're interested in if he offers a sliding scale. Many therapists recognize that some people do not have a comprehensive insurance plan (or any insurance at all), and are willing to work with those patients at a reduced rate.

, In order to become a licensed marriage and family therapist, a counselor needs to have completed one of three educational requirements. A marriage counselor may have earned a master's degree (which takes two to three years to complete), a doctoral program (which takes three to five years to complete), or a post-graduate clinical training program (which typically takes between three and four years to complete).


Typically, after graduating from an accredited program, a counselor will complete a mandatory post-degree supervised clinical training program. This is usually required, regardless of the counselor's degree earned.
You may also find a PhD-level licensed professional counselor (LPC) or psychologist with extensive experience counseling couples.

, In addition to ensuring that a given counselor has the right background, it's also a good idea to confirm that that therapist is licensed. Depending on which state you reside in, a marriage counselor may be required to pass a state licensing exam, the national examination administered by the Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards (AMFTRB), or both.


You can often find information about a given therapist's licensing status by checking that therapist's website. If you cannot find that information there, ask the therapist directly.

, Though a therapist is not required to join a professional organization/association, it's usually a good sign when a therapist is a member of one. A therapist's membership indicates that she has a personal interest in counseling, as well as a desire to continue to learn and adapt her practice with new trends in the field.One of the biggest professional organizations for marriage counselors is the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapists (AAMFT).AAMFT requires supervised training and mandatory coursework of all members to ensure quality and consistency.

, Different therapists have differing approaches to therapy. It's important to get a sense of how a therapist would proceed if you were to begin sessions with him.


Ask the therapist how he would want to proceed with treatment, and whether he uses any particular therapeutic modality in his practice. Then read up about that treatment plan to see if you think it could help you.A good therapist will suggest different techniques and treatment strategies for you to work on at home between sessions.
Find out about the therapist's projected treatment plan. You should specifically ask how many sessions you can expect to have, how long each session will last, and what kind of timetable you can expect for results., It may seem like a strange question to ask a marriage counselor you're interested in working with, but it can also be a very important thing to know. Some marriage counselors urge their clients to leave the marriage when things get rocky, either because of the therapist's beliefs or her unwillingness to continue working through problems. This may be the mark of a poor therapist for your needs, especially if you're committed to working through your problems no matter what.You should specifically ask the therapist at what point she considers divorce to be a viable option.

, Each therapist brings his own set of values to the practice of marriage counseling, which can be good, bad, or neutral. However, those values shouldn't intrude on your therapy in problematic ways. It's important to determine what your therapist's values are to ensure that he will be a good fit for you and your partner moving forward.If a therapist says there is only one way to have a successful marriage, you should consider finding someone else to work with.
Ask a therapist you're interested in what his personality is like. That may give you some insight into how well he'd fit with you and your spouse.Determine what kinds of patients the therapist works with before you describe your problem. That way you'll know whether he can help you right off the bat.
Describe yourself, your spouse, and your marital problem(s). Ask the counselor how he thinks the first session or two might go when dealing with that problem to get a sense of what to expect.

, There are many therapeutic approaches that are generally recognized as being effective and medially-sound. It may be a good idea to find out what kinds of therapeutic approaches your counselor uses to see if it would fit well with your needs. Two common evidence-based approaches to marriage counseling are Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy and the Gottman Method.Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy works to rebuild the foundation of a marriage by focusing on repairing trust, fostering emotional intimacy, and rekindling feelings of love and affection.
The Gottman Method works to rebuild a marriage by first changing the behaviors of each partner. This method emphasizes communication skills, conflict resolution, strengthening the friendship within a marriage, and being more caring/considerate partners to one another.

, Marriage counseling should not feel like a never-ending pursuit. Early in the counseling, you and your partner should set concrete goals with your therapist so that the ensuing sessions have some direction and focus. Each subsequent session should have those goals in mind and should work to help you and your partner find ways to meet your goals.You won't see results overnight, but if you haven't seen any improvement in your marriage after several weeks' worth of sessions, you may want to consider looking for another therapist.A good therapist should make both spouses feel respected and heard. If your therapist takes sides or ""gangs up"" on you or your spouse, you should consider looking for another therapist.Don't get frustrated. Saving a marriage takes time and effort from both you and your partner, you won't be able to do it alone. If the therapist you're seeing isn't helping you reach your clearly-defined goals, it's worth your marriage to find one who will.

Encourage active listening in the group.,

Speak to group members privately, if needed.",How to Effectively Lead Groups3," If you notice there is tension in the group, try to get all group members to do active listening. This may be useful if you notice conflict between two members in the group. Active listening will ensure that everyone listens to each other and responds thoughtfully to each other.As the leader of the group, model active listening for the group members. Start a discussion with a group member and listen intently to what they have to say. Make eye contact and maintain a relaxed body posture, with your body positioned towards them. Nod and smile to show you are listening.
Once the person is finished talking, rephrase their thoughts back to them and confirm you heard them correctly. You may say, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I believe what you are saying is…”. Once they confirm you heard them correctly, you can respond to them.

, If you notice issues between group members, be direct and work with the group to resolve the issue. State that you are concerned about a conflict in the group. Use “I” statements. Ask open ended questions to get the group members to discuss the issue.For example, you may say, “I am feeling like there is tension between group members. How do you all feel about this?” or “I am feeling tension in the group. Can we talk about the issue as a group?”

, Sometimes issues in a group are best resolved privately, especially if it is between two individuals in a large group. If you notice conflict, pull the individuals aside. Ask them if you can all speak privately about the issue. Set up a meeting with you and the individuals to discuss the issue in a private setting.


Doing this can put the individuals at ease and make it easier for them to talk one on one, rather than in the big group.

But it’s not—depression makes it hard to for people to connect emotionally with their loved ones. In order to be available to this person and help them, it is important to understand that it’s not personal. , When you are talking to a depressed family member, you have to keep in mind that they are dealing with an actual physical problem. It can be tempting to blame their mental disorder on decisions they have made, but recognizing that it’s not their fault can help you be less critical and more supportive.Keep in mind that your support can help them recover from depression.

, Your support of their recovery process is one of the most valuable things you can offer someone struggling with depression. Offering to let someone with depression talk about what they are feeling without judging them is an important part of recovery. It will help them feel less alone.You can also offer to help them find a support group, where they can talk to people who have been through what they are going through, to help them feel less lone.

, In order to help your depressed family member, you need to know what they are experiencing. With depression, there are a lot of things that can be going on, so to get to the heart of it, you have to ask direct questions. You can prompt your loved on to explore why they are feeling depressed to help them get to the other side of it.Ask questions like:

“When did you first start to feel bad?”
”Do you know what triggered these feelings?”
”What makes it worse?”
”What makes it better?”



, Demanding that your loved one change the way they feel is a pointless exercise, mostly because they don’t know how to change how they feel. You will feel frustrated when they don’t change, and they will feel angry toward you, perhaps even feeling more depressed than ever.


This can also trigger shame in them, which makes things even worse.

, If you try to rescue your family member, they will not learn for themselves how to manage feelings of sadness on their own. It is unlikely that you will be able to make the depression go away, and the fact that you are sticking your finger into their lives can trigger depressed relatives to feel frustrated with you.This will also lead you to have negative interactions with your loved one, such as when fixing it doesn’t work and you get angry with them.
Accept them for who they are and where they are emotionally.

, Develop realistic expectations for your depressed loved one and maintain an attitude full of hope for them. Your loved one can get help for depression, and they can change. There is hope, and if you keep this in the forefront of your mind, you can help them have hope as well., Sad feelings are the hallmark of depression, especially feeling sad when there is no cause for it. This feeling of sadness can weigh on your family member’s soul, and watching for signs of this extra sadness is key for identifying depression.Listen to them when they talk to see if they sound like they are very sad but they don’t know why.
They may also exhibit signs of tearfulness, feeling empty, and feeling hopeless.

, Losing interest in things that used to get them excited is a classic sign of depression. Watch their behavior and notice if they start replying “no” frequently to activities that they used to love, as well as acting listless and bored most of the time.These are usually things like hobbies and sports.
People who are listless and have no interest in anything can also be lethargic, not wanting to move or do physical activity.

, People with depression are sad about life and discouraged about things that used to make them happy, so they are not happy. Being unhappy can make you generally irritable, getting upset about small things on a regular basis. If someone in your family can’t seem to ever be happy, they may be depressed., People with depression tend to go to one extreme or the other when it comes to sleep. They either can’t sleep at all or sleep way too much. The inability to sleep is called insomnia, and if someone in your family starts complaining about insomnia, watch for other signs of depression.Sleeping too much is a way to escape having to feel negative feelings most of the time.

, Finding out for yourself how depression works is a good place to start in dealing with a depressed family member. This not only allows you to understand the way your family member’s illness works, but it shows that you are supportive and that they are valuable to you, all things someone with depression needs to feel., A family member’s depression affects the whole family, not just the person dealing with it. Sitting down as a family to discuss it can help your depressed family member express themselves and feel supported. This also helps you discover what works and does not work., If your depressed family member agrees, you can meet with their therapist now and then to check on their progress. This way, you can see if what you’re doing at home is helping them or hurting them. The therapist can also educate you so that you can help even more., It may help to seek out couples or family counseling to help everyone share their feelings about the family member’s depression alongside individual therapy for the depressed family member. This therapy can help restore relationships that have been disjointed by depression, especially marriages.Family counseling also helps children understand their role, clarifying that it is not their fault.

, Offer to help your depressed family member find and build a support system. You can poll your friends to see if any of them have had depression and see if they can talk to your family member. You can find area support groups and see if your family member would be interested in joining one.


It’s also important for you to build a support system so that you don’t feel isolated and overwhelmed by taking care of a depressed family member., Most importantly, encourage your depressed family member to seek out a therapist, offering to help them find one that meets their needs. You may have gotten a recommendation from someone, or have an insurance plan that requires you to look at specific therapists.


Your help can keep the depressed family member from feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the therapy process, which is very important for their success.

Tell a story with your documentary.,
Aim to persuade the audience.,
Strike an emotional chord.,
Sell your audience on the subject matter.",How to Write a Documentary3," As noted above, the best documentaries tell stories that are just as compelling as those you might find in an ordinary movie. This storytelling approach can be used to great effect regardless of the subject of your documentary.The way you write, shoot, and edit your film will affect the way your audience sees your ""characters"" and reacts to your ""plot"". Use your movie's narrative to prove your point to your audience. Try asking yourself the following questions as you write and plan your documentary to ensure your film tells the story you want to tell:


""How do I want my audience to feel about the people and events I'm portraying?""
""What sort of message am I trying to convey with each scene?""
""What's the best way to order my scenes to get my desired message across?""
""How can I use the sounds and visuals of my movie to make my point?""

, Ideally, your documentary should inspire your audience to act or feel differently than they did before they watched it. Even relatively light-hearted documentaries can benefit from taking this sort of persuasive approach, so never lose sight of the sort of reaction you're trying to create in your audience.


For some documentaries, like those that tackle controversial social issues, the sort of persuasion you're trying to go for is usually obvious. For others, it may be a little more subtle. For instance, if we're writing a documentary about a strange subculture of people who like to get together and pretend to be unicorns, we might set the goal for ourselves of convincing the audience that even though the hobby these people share is very strange, it still gives them a valuable sense of community that they may not find elsewhere.

, When you get the chance, go for the audience's heart! Proving your point with logic is, of course, highly desirable. However, not every member of the audience will be receptive to pure, unemotional logic. Even the members of your audience who do agree with your film's logic can be further persuaded if they get a serious emotional reaction from the film. Look for opportunities to show the tragedy or humor in the events you're portraying. A truly great documentary will engage the audience's heart as well as its mind.


For instance, in the example from earlier where we're making a documentary about the U.S.-Mexico drug trade, we may want to include the heartbreaking story of someone who has lost family members to drug-related violence along the border. This gives a human face to the point we're trying to make by showing how a real person's life has been affected by the subject of our documentary.

, Remember, your subject matter is important, even if, in the grand scheme of things, it's actually not! You're making a film about something that has excited, intrigued, or captivated you, so make it your goal for your film to have the same effect on the audience as the subject matter has on you.


For instance, in The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, the central conflict between the newcomer to the world of competitive video gaming and the reigning champion is something that seriously matters only to a tiny, insignificant group of people. However, because the filmmakers portray it as a quirky underdog tale, it's actually surprisingly exciting to watch. The audience gets wrapped up in the competition even though, in the end, the only thing at stake is bragging rights in a ragtag group of video game aficionados.

Create character profiles.,
Decide on a character arc.,
Establish backstory.,
Craft relationships between characters.,
Give your characters strong opinions.",How to Create a Character Driven Book2," Character profiles can be useful tools in a character driven book. As you begin to develop your major characters, consider writing up character profiles to refer to as you write your work.Character profiles list a character's personality traits, physical appearance, personal relationships and so on. You should try to write up a character profile for each major character in your book.
Start with the basics. Write down your character's full name and physical details like height, weight, eye color, hair color, and so on. Also, make sure to chart out basic relationship. Lists parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners, and so on.
From here, talk about deeper issues. Lists your character wants, fears, and needs. Talk about what your character likes and dislikes. What does your character want out of life? What about him or herself does your character want to change? Also, include things like religious and political views, as these are important insights to a character's personality.
You may find, as you begin to write, you do not include every detail in your actual book. However, knowing your character's intimately can be helpful for you as a writer. You may find you incorporate a lot of the information from your character profiles in the subtext of your work.

, A character arc represents your character's emotional journey throughout the course of a work. In a character driven book, a character arc is the driving force of your story. Your character's internal arc will be how you figure out the rising action, climax, and falling action of your story.Essentially, your character arc is how we get from Point A to Point B in your story. Let's return to the ballet dancer example. Your main character should go from obsessing over perfection and control to accepting life's ambiguities. How do you get your character to this point?
Think of events that will shape your character. In our example, the ballet dancer's estranged father resurfaces. As your dancer cares for his ailing father, you can include flashbacks to his childhood. This can reveal an amount of chaos that was frightening. You can also use the progression of his father's illness to drive the story forward, each stage of his father's sickness forcing the ballet dancer to recognize how much of life is beyond his control.

, Your character should come with a history attached to him or her. Try writing a brief biography for each character you create. Where was the character born? What was his or her childhood like? Where did he or she go to school? What important events occurred in his or her life? This information is all vital to a character's current personality.


Much like the information in your character profiles, it's unlikely that you'll include every detail of a character's backstory in your book. However, this information may be useful for you as a writer. You can add details subtly or burry them in the context.

, Character relationships are very important to a character driven story. Oftentimes, a relationship is of central importance to the realizations a character has that drive his or her story arc. As you develop your characters, focus on their relationships with one another.You may want to map out relationships between character. Use a big sheet of construction paper to write out all your characters. Draw color-coded lines between characters to represent relationships. For example, a red line is a romantic relationship. A blue line is a family relationship.
Grudges can go a long way in developing characters. A lot of tension in a character driven work comes from characters who dislike each other or have a troubled history.
Focus on how these relationships will change. Will characters grow apart, reconcile, or develop animosity as time goes by?

, Strong opinions can make for interesting, dynamic characters. They can also help move the story forward. How a character's opinion changes over time can be a focal point of that character's arc. Strong opinions can also foster disagreement between characters, creating compelling conflict in a story.Characters with strong opinions can be very driven. This can help keep a character driven story moving. For example, the ballet dancer is of the opinion perfection and success are vital to a life well lived. He may be dismissive of people he sees as lazy. This can create tension in his personal relationships, as his opinions may make him judgmental or overbearing.
Strong opinions often change during the course of a story. Your climax will seem more exciting if your character is forced to abandon opinions he or she has clung to strongly throughout a work.

Use open body language.,
Identify emotional body language.,
Avoid blocking.,
Spot when someone is lying.,
Consider spacing.,
Identify your body language patterns.",How to Communicate With Body Language1," This means that you have an assertive handshake, sit calmly, but exude energy, and seem in control of all gestures. Your posture should be relaxed, but your back should be straight. This shows people you are comfortable and confident. Pause when you speak to draw in the listener and show confidence.
Keep your legs slightly apart so you take up more space. This also demonstrates confidence. Lean in slightly when a person is speaking to show interest (leaning away will show a sense of hostility). Don’t cross your arms. Instead, let them dangle at your sides or press them together in your lap. This shows you are open to other people.
Make sure your handshake is firm, but not too crushing. Look the other person in the eyes, although you shouldn’t stare too much. Blink, and look away sometimes so they don’t feel you are trying to be intimidating.
Play with your tone of voice. Tone of voice is a way that people communicate confidence. The key to success is projecting confidence.;
, You can determine emotions by paying careful attention to non-verbal cues. You should also take into context what’s going on at the time you spot the emotional signs, though.


When people are angry, their face flushes, they bare their teeth, they clench their fists, and they invade body space, sometimes by leaning forward. When people are nervous or anxious, their face pales, their mouth seems dry (so they may drink water or lick their lips), they show varying speech tone, and they have tension in their muscles (so they may clench their arms or hands, and their elbows may be drawn in to their sides.) Other signs of nervousness include trembling lip, fidgeting, and gasping or holding breath.

, If you are giving a presentation or speech, you want to be as open as you can to your audience. Thus, you should remove physical barriers that will limit your ability to connect.


Podiums, computers, chairs, and even a folder, are all props that create distance between a speaker and audience, preventing a sense of connection.
Crossing your arms or speaking to someone while sitting behind a computer monitor are blocking behaviors.

, Body language can give away liars. They might be able to hide their lies in their words, but their bodies often tell another story.


Liars are less likely to maintain eye contact, and their pupils may appear constricted.
Turning the body away from you is a sign of lying.
Complexion changes, such as redness in the neck or face, and perspiration, are all signs of lying, as are vocal changes like clearing of the throat.
Be aware that some signs of lying – sweating, poor or no eye contact- are also indications of nervousness or fear. , Different cultures have different ideas about how much physical space you should give another person. But, generally, social distance is broken down into four categories.


Intimate distance. Defined as touching another person to 45 centimeters. If you enter a person’s intimate distance, this can be very unsettling for them unless it’s welcomed or you’re already intimate.
Personal distance. 45 centimeters to 1.2 m. You are close enough to shake hands and to see each other’s expressions and gestures.
Social distance. This is the normal distance in situations that are impersonal or business transactions, defined as 1.2 m to 3.6 m. Speech should be louder and eye contact remains important.
Public distance. 3.7m to 4.5m. Examples of those who often operate in public distance are teachers or those who talk to people in groups. Non-verbal communication is critical but often exaggerated. Hand gestures and head movements can be more important than facial expressions as the latter are often not perceived.

, Make a conscious effort to think about what your body is doing in different interactions with different people. A mirror can be useful to examine facial expressions and posture, but mainly you just want to pay attention to what your body does when you're angry, nervous, or happy.


Determine whether your body language is in sync with your message. Your body language is effective if it communicates the message you want it to communicate. Does your posture communicate confidence, or does it make you seem unsure of yourself even though your words express confidence?
If your non-verbal signals match your words, you'll not only communicate more clearly, you'll also be perceived as being more charismatic.

See if he tells you he doesn't want a relationship.,
See if he never talks about a future with you.,
See if all he talks about is sex.",How to Tell when a Guy Is Using You for Sex3," Guys who are using a woman for sex often give few or no details about themselves. Have you gleaned what you know about him from friends, personal observation, general conversations, past interactions, or has he really volunteered personal and revelatory information about himself to you? This is a VERY telling point, so it is worth considering carefully.

, Does he get bored quickly when you discuss your work, your hobbies, your activities, general daily issues? Does he try to stop the discussion and turn it back into ""fixing everything with a snuggle on the couch""?. If so, he might be pushing aside the emotional entanglement of a real relationship just so that he can keep open the using side without feelings of guilt. He could also present himself as a counselor and offer advice about all of your issues, but not disclose any of his so that you can be involved in his life.

, Have you never heard him randomly ask if you're upset, ask how your day was, or just wonder why you had tears in your eyes? If he seems absolutely allergic to your emotions, then chances are it's not because he's too shy to ask or too awkward to help you deal, but it's because, well, he just doesn't really care that much. If he's just into you for sex, then any of your complicated, messy feelings will be a hurdle for him and nothing more.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but many women refuse to see what's right in front of their eyes, even if they hear it. If he has told you that he's just into casual dating, that he doesn't have time for anything serious, or that he's just not a relationship kind of guy, then he probably meant it. You might have brushed this aside, thought he was just trying to play hard to get, or were convinced that you could change him. Well, if he has specifically told you that he's essentially not interested in much more than sex, then you need to rethink your ""relationship.""

, Have you been hooking up for months and haven't ever talked about what you're going to do even a month from the day you see your guy, let alone next summer? Have you been at it for over a year but you haven't made any moves to get more serious? If not, then he may just see you as a temporary thing and isn't ready to be the boyfriend you want him to be.

, Is he interested in emotional discussions about his feelings? Does he discuss where things are headed with the two of you? Or is it more you? Or is he more interested in whether you've purchased new crotchless undies and if you remembered to pop into the pharmacy this morning for additional supplies? Or if you considered trying out that new sexual position?

Consider taking on non-divorce cases.",How to Become a Divorce Mediator," Generally, states have no requirements for practicing mediation.

However, some counties might set rules for who can practice mediation in their county. You should research the state and county where you want to work.

You should contact your state’s bar association. Most mediators are lawyers, and bar associations are organizations made up of lawyers. They should have more information about any requirements in the state or county where you want to practice.
You can also look at the Mediation Works website, which summarizes the laws in all 50 states. The website is available here: http://www.mediationworks.com/medcert3/staterequirements.htm.;
, Many state courts maintain rosters of court-approved mediators. Getting on a roster is a great way to find clients, since the judges will only make referrals to mediators on the roster. You should find out the requirements for being placed on rosters.


Each state is different. Generally, however, you’ll need a degree and specialized training in family or divorce mediation.It will be very difficult to develop a divorce mediation career outside of the rosters, so you should commit to satisfying the court’s requirements.

, To get on most court rosters, you will need at least a bachelor’s degree.You should check with the state or county to check if they recommend certain subjects.


Many divorce mediators earn degrees in psychology and social work.Some divorce mediators also earn an undergraduate degree in law, though law is not an undergraduate degree in the U.S.

, Many divorce mediators are also lawyers who have a family law or divorce practice.

Because it might be difficult to earn a living doing only mediation work, you should consider obtaining a law degree. Your divorce mediation business could be just one part of your entire law practice.

Many law schools offer coursework in mediation, which would be ideal. Some have clinics devoted to mediation, where you will be able to handle a mediation under faculty supervision.
You can find information about law schools at the American Bar Association’s website: http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/.
Carefully consider the expense of law school before rushing off to apply. Most states do not require a law degree to qualify for their rosters, so it isn’t required. Law schools often charge $40,000 a year or more in tuition. You’ll also need to pay for living expenses. Avoid applying for law school until you can justify the expense.

, An advanced degree can help prepare you for your divorce mediation career by allowing you to specialize. It also gives you more career options if your mediation career doesn’t take off. In addition to a law degree, you might consider graduate degrees in psychology or social work.


If you earn a graduate degree in psychology, for example, you could specialize in marriage and family counseling.Because divorce cases can be financially complicated, some states encourage you to become a certified public accountant. For example, Tennessee considers a CPA designation as an acceptable educational credential for divorce mediators., Courts will require specialized training before they place you on their rosters. The number of hours required will depend on the location. For example, in New Jersey, Family Part Mediators require 40 hours of divorce mediation training.The amount of training required differs by location. To be listed as a family mediator in Tennessee, for example, you need 40 hours of family mediation with specific components (such as domestic violence). You also need four hours of training in Tennessee’s family law and court procedures.You can find training programs through your local bar association or through a local mediation association.

, Your education never ends as a mediator. Instead, you’ll probably need to take additional coursework throughout your career to stay on top of changes in the field.


For example, the Vermont Court Mediation Program requires mediators to earn 20 hours of continuing education every two years.Other states might require more or less continuing education. In Indiana, for example, you will need six hours of continuing education every two years.

, Court rosters often require that you have practiced mediation for a certain amount of time before you qualify for the roster. You should contact the court for the county where you want to practice to find out your particular requirements.


Even if you don’t want to accept court-appointed work, gaining initial experience is critical. This is the time to learn and make mistakes.

, Some states will require internships. For example, New Hampshire’s court system requires that you intern for 60 hours and handle six different marital mediation cases before you can qualify for the roster.

You can find internship opportunities by contacting your nearest mediation organization. You might intern with a seasoned divorce mediator or with a community mediation service.
You should also talk to other newer divorce mediators to ask them about their mediation experience. They might recommend an experienced mediator you can intern with, or they could warn you to avoid someone they had a bad experience with.

, Some state courts require you to earn a number of hours co-mediation with an experienced mentor. For example, New Hampshire’s courts require 54 hours in co-mediation.Find a mentor who practices divorce mediation and not a different specialty


You could possibly combine your mentoring with your internship.
Realize that some experienced mediators will offer their services for free, but others might charge a fee.When you find a potential mentor, you should fully discuss expectations, including the cost.

, You can also gain valuable experience performing pro bono services. This is a great way to learn skills and begin to build a reputation in the mediation community. In some states, courts will expect that you perform some pro bono to stay listed on their roster.


For example, Alabama requires domestic relations mediators to provide 10 hours of mediation pro bono upon request.In Delaware, mediators complete five pro bono mediations to complete their training.

, Most divorce mediation is court-appointed, so you want to get on a local roster as soon as possible. Visit your local courthouse and ask how to sign up. They will want to see that you have satisfied all their requirements, so gather supporting documents, such as proof of education and training certificates.


You will probably have to complete an application that discusses in detail your experience., Today, people go online when they need help with something, so you’ll want a web presence. Invest in a quality website.The more professional the website looks, the better.


Consider hiring someone to build the website, unless you have a background in web design. People will judge you based on how professional your website looks. Websites with jarring graphics and sloppy grammar will turn people off.
If you have no money, then buy a package with a website like GoDaddy or Wix.com. They will sell you a domain and then offer templates that allow you to create a basic website.

, You can also get your name out by mailing people who you think would provide referrals to divorcing couples. You should invest in quality stationery and then draft a letter of about two to three paragraphs. In your letter, you should identify yourself and explain a little bit about your practice.


Give your recipients a way to express interest. For example, you can include a post card which they can send back if they want more information about your services.
Target people who might learn about the difficulties a couple is having. For example, you can send your letter to clergy, therapists, and accountants.Also target mediators who don’t practice divorce mediation. They might be aware that a client is considering divorce and can provide referrals.

, Lawyers are another good source of referrals. When people are thinking about divorcing, they will contact a lawyer, who might not have the skills to handle a mediation themselves. You will want them to send clients your way.


Include attorneys in your first-class mailing, but also schedule lunches so that you can get to know them personally.
Remember to offer something in return. For example, you can agree to refer couples to the attorney if mediation fails and they want to divorce.You have to give something to get something in return.

, Your state should have a mediation organization that you can join. Some allow people to join as students, so you can begin early establishing yourself. Organizations provide many great resources. It is also how you can meet other divorce mediators.


Remember to get involved in these organizations. Join one or two committees and work hard to impress the other members.If you’re a lawyer, then you should also participate in your local or state bar association.

, Writing articles shows potential clients that you are engaged in the divorce mediation business and also an expert in the field. You can target different audiences with different articles.


For example, an article on divorce mediation with a bar journal or law review will increase your visibility with other mediators and with lawyers, who are good sources of referrals.
By contrast, a basic article explaining the nuts and bolts of divorce mediation might be appropriate for your local newspaper or for posting on your website. You can showcase your knowledge to the public this way.

, Advertising is expensive, and it might not yield great dividends. Nevertheless, there’s no better way to get your name in front of many people. Consider the following:


Phone book ads. Buy an ad in your phone book’s Yellow Pages. Be sure to identify your specialty in the ad.Online advertising. Websites such as Mediate.com are great sites for advertising your services. Also think about Google Adwords, which is a pay-per-click form of advertising. Google allows you to target specific regions, cities, or countries.
Newspaper ads. Target local newspapers and call to ask how much it costs to run an ad. Run your ad more than once, since people usually need to see an ad several times before they call., You should research what other divorce mediators in your area charge. You want to be competitive. Your instinct might be to set your fee very low. However, you shouldn’t undercharge. You will be working hard and earning every penny.Think about how you want to structure your fees. For example, some mediators have clients pay upfront and then deduct from this amount as they earn the fee. Others have clients pay as they go.

, You’ll use many forms in your business, and you should prepare them before you open your doors. Over time, you may need to change them, but you should have something in hand when you start.


For example, you should certainly spell out your fees in a fee agreement which you ask clients to sign before you begin mediation. You can find sample fee agreements online or through your local mediation association.
You’ll also need intake forms, which potential clients can fill out when they first contact you.These forms will ask for background information on the dispute.
You should also prepare “agreement to mediate” and confidentiality forms.

, You might need to cut your teeth handling non-divorce mediations. For example, you might tackle employment disputes or small claims cases. You can get this work either by signing up for a court roster or simply advertising and accepting any referrals that come your way.


Try to be open to non-divorce cases, at least in the beginning. If a lawyer refers a landlord-tenant dispute to you for mediation, then you might receive divorce case referrals later if you do a great job.
The more diverse your practice, the better your chances of thriving financially.

The first thing to do is stop your car. Switch on your hazard lights to alert other drivers to the accident. If signs are posted that state to do so, pull out of the lane of traffic onto the shoulder or emergency lane.Evaluate yourself for any injuries that might have been caused by the crash. Try to keep calm and think about the safety of yourself and the passengers in your the car.


After checking yourself over, look around the car and talk to your passengers to see if anybody is hurt.
If you or any of your passengers are injured, call the emergency services immediately. This means both the police and an ambulance.;
, If nobody in your car is hurt and it is safe for you to get out of your car, you can go and check on the other car involved in the accident. The first priority should be safety so you need to assess the situation carefully.If it is safe to check the other car, and you discover that somebody is hurt, you should call the emergency services immediately.


If the road is blocked by your car or the other car involved in the accident you should call the police so they can come and close the road and avoid any further accidents.
Do not in any circumstances keep driving or leave the scene of the accident before everything is taken care of.In many countries, if you fail to stop after an accident you may be charged with an offence., You should always prioritise the health and safety of the people involved in the accident before you start thinking about your car and your insurance.Once you are satisfied everyone is okay and safe, you can start evaluating the damage to the vehicles involved. The extent of the damage will determine whether you need to call the police immediately or if you can call them a little later. The law varies by state, but if you are in doubt make the call and explain that it is not an emergency.You should always report an accident to the police within 24 hours, but if it is not an emergency and doesn't require the police to attend, you do not have to call from the scene of the accident.If the value of the damage is above around $1000 you should call the police from the scene to report the accident immediately.A minor dent or scratch will not require immediate police involvement.Nevertheless, it's best to call the police when your memory of the incident is fresh. You are likely to forget details if you try to fill in a police report later., If the accident is minor, nobody is hurt, and the driver from the other has stopped his car and is cooperating and sharing his name, address, licence number and insurance details you will not need to call the police. Nevertheless, it is always the best idea to call the police for your own protection and for insurance purposes.Definitely contact the police if:


The driver doesn't stop or drives away without giving you the information you need.The driver appears intoxicated or was driving dangerously.
The driver threatens you in any way, or is aggressive and confrontational.

, When you are talking to the other driver it's important that you keep calm and get all the information you need. Do not admit culpability, or blame the other person for the accident. Dispassionately gather all the personal and insurance details.You should record the name, address and contact details of the other driver.
Write down the driver's licence number, licence plate number, the make and model of his car, and his insurance company., Thanks to the miracle of mobile phones, almost everyone now has a camera with them at all times. Take immediate notes of what you think happened, and snap some photos of the damage to your car and to the other car. This will be very useful for filing your insurance claim later.It will also be helpful if the other driver decides to file a case against you or claim that the accident caused more damage than it really did. Take photos from as many angles as you can.

, If anybody is hurt, there is serious damage to the car, or the other driver does not cooperate, then you definitely need to call the police to report the situation and get some assistance. When talking to the police on the phone, keep calm. Clearly state your name and say you’ve been in a car accident. It is also important to give the police your exact location so they can send someone out to you immediately.


After calling the police, call your insurance agency right away.
You should always call the police before you call your insurance company., When the police arrive be polite, but do not tell the police that the accident was your fault, even if you may think so.Equally, you should not tell the police officer that the accident was the other driver's fault. Stick to the facts and describe what happened objectively. It is important for you to be honest and objective.

, The police officer will ask you questions, but you also need to get some information from him too. You should be sure that you record the name of the officer on the scene, as well as his badge or ID number. Note down his phone number and the police report number for the accident.


You should also ask for a copy of the police report. This may take a few days, but can be important if there is a dispute about which driver was at fault."

Before beginning the process of changing your name, practice signing it, and have a few people close to you call you by that name to make sure you like it.

, You will not be able to change your name if your new name would imply ""fraudulent intent"" (i.e. that you are not trying to gain some benefit by misleading others about your identity).There are, however, several other reasons why you might be denied a name change, including any of the following:You are avoiding bankruptcy by pretending to be someone else.
Your new name violates a trademark (e.g. changing your name to ""Chuck E. Cheese"" or ""Adidas Batman"").
The name uses numbers or symbols (except Roman numerals).
The name includes obscene words.
If you are having trouble determining if your name change is legal, or need legal assistance with this process, hire an attorney. Legal self-help centers may also available to help with name changes, and legal fees may be waived if you demonstrate sufficient financial need. Search online to see what legal aid resources are available in your community.

, To get a court order officially changing your name, you must fill out a formal request, called an Application for Change of Name of Adult. Different counties in Ohio use their own versions of this form, which are available at the county's probate court or through the probate court's website. The Supreme Court of Ohio provides a standard Application, which you can download here. You can find links to different probate court divisions in Ohio here.


Leave the case number blank. You will not be issued a case number until you file your forms with the court clerk.

, This is a ""proposed order,"" which you must fill out and submit with your paperwork. If the judge grants your Application, he or she will sign and date the Judgment Entry. Different counties in Ohio use their own versions of this form, but the Supreme Court of Ohio provides a standard form, which you can download here. Do not sign and date the form yourself. That space is for the judge to fill.

, As each county in Ohio has its own forms and requirements for changing your name, you may need to fill out additional forms. Consult your court's website or ask the court clerk about any additional required forms.

, Bring your documents to the court clerk's office at the courthouse. The clerk will stamp your documents, issue a case number, and give you a hearing date.

, Ohio courts generally require those applying for name changes to publish a notice of the hearing in a county newspaper.This ensures that potential creditors and other interested parties have a chance to object to the Application. Each county has its own forms, but the Supreme Court of Ohio provides a standard form, which you can download here. Fill out the form, then contact your county newspaper and ask how to get your Notice published. You will be responsible for any fee associated with the publication of your Notice.


Your Notice must appear in the newspaper at least 30 days prior to your court date.
Keep a copy of the newspaper in case the judge asks for proof that you published your Notice.
You may be required to file your completed Notice of Hearing on Change of Name form. Ask the clerk about your county's policy.

, The clerk will instruct you to appear in court at a later date. The judge will ask you about your reasons for changing your name to make sure that your new name is not fraudulent or misleading.Answer the judge's questions clearly and honestly.


If your application is denied, get a copy of the denial order and try again.
If the judge approves your request, you will be granted a name change court order.

, Once you have received a court order changing your name, your next step will be to obtain a new Social Security card, which will require you to fill out a form and either deliver it to a Social Security Administration office or mail it in with the required documents.Download and complete the application for a new Social Security card, available online.

Gather your paperwork together. You will need your court order, birth certificate, photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID card) and a completed application for a new Social Security card.Submit your documents to the Social Security Administration. You can make an appointment to change your name in person, or you can mail in the appropriate documents. All original copies will be mailed back to you with a receipt.You can find the address for the Social Security office nearest you via a locator on the Social Security Administration website.Your new card should arrive within 10 business days from the date on your receipt., Visit your local BMV with your Social Security card and court order to receive a new license.

It doesn’t matter if you know the person giving you the drink or if they look like an underwear model, it doesn’t necessarily make them safe or sane. Sadly, because you are more likely to be raped by someone you know, you don’t even want to take a drink from a friend in this situation. The only exception is if someone offers you a drink and you watch the bartender pour it and then hand it to you directly.


A good person will be understanding about your wanting to be safe. Simply take the drink and talk to them but don’t drink it or thank them for the drink and say something like, “A friend of mine got roofied last year and now I’m just extra cautious.” This doesn’t even have to be true, since people will not usually argue with you on personal experience.

, Even just being out with a friend who also drinks can help protect you, as long as you take things seriously and stick together. Take someone you trust and be just as trustworthy to them. The buddy system can not only add fun to your evening, but it can make a real difference in your safety on a large number of levels, not just in preventing rape.


Going together can help you defend each other against theft, kidnapping, drunk driving, and other forms of physical harm that can result when you're drunk.

, No matter if you’re buying your own drink or if someone is getting one for you, you should always watch the bartender pour it. Always. Even if you’re just getting your own drink, if it sits unattended on the counter for even a few seconds, someone could slip something in. Be vigilant.

, Similarly, you should never take your eye off your drink. Take it with you when you go to the bathroom. Don’t set it down on the table behind you while you show someone how much better you are at pool than they are. Keep it in your hand and clearly visible at all times.

, Make sure you have a ride home already arranged, so that you don’t have to rely on a stranger or possibly dangerous acquaintance. Get a friend to come and pick you up, have the bartender get you in a cab (alone), or better yet, bring a sober friend with you. Taking a drunk person home is one of the most common techniques of a rapist.

, Soon, there will be cups and straws readily available that will change color to alert you that your drink has been drugged.You might want to also consider other safety precautions, like using the circleof6 app. There are many such apps that can set off an alarm, alert your friends that you need help, or help your family keep track of when you’re home safe (as well as a number of other features, available depending on which app you get).

, When you’re coming home at night, look around. Do you see anyone hanging out around your building door? Do you see any suspicious cars in your driveway? If you do, call someone for help, or even just get a friend on the phone and have a conversation with them while you get safely into your home and lock the door. A good friend will understand, even if it’s late.

, Since you are most likely to be raped by someone that you know, protect yourself by not being alone with someone that might hurt you. Be careful around new friends and other people that haven’t fully earned your trust yet, like neighbors. Don’t go into a neighbor’s house alone or have them over when you’re alone in your home (the same with new friends) until you know them much better.

, Have a safe place that you can go within your home, if you’re worried about threats from your family. Consider putting a lock on your bedroom door, for example, if you have reason to believe that you are under threat from a family member.


Of course, if you’re still a minor, you should consult with CPS if you really believe you are under threat. You should not stay in a home that is not safe. Loving your family is not a good enough reason to put yourself at risk.
If you are an adult and feel at risk from your spouse or other family member, you may want to contact a friend or local women's shelter that can take you and your children until the situation is resolved and another solution can be found.

, Let your family know when someone makes you uncomfortable or does something bad to you. Many family members would be willing to stand up for you or get you help, but they may not be aware of what is going on. It can be a very scary experience, but any family member that is not willing to believe you or at least investigate further isn’t worthy of your love.

, To avoid being raped by someone you know, all you can really do is look out for signs of trouble and get out or get help before the situation escalates to rape. For example, an abusive relationship can easily lead to rape. The same can be said of family members. Pay attention to see if they’re grooming you to stay quiet about physical or sexual violence, such as emphasizing the private, special nature of your relationship or trying to teach you that no one trusts you or thinks you’re smart. If you notice behaviors that seem suspicious, dangerous, or make you uncomfortable or afraid, get help.


If you are a minor, contact CPS (Child Protective Services), a teacher at your school, a doctor, or other trusted adult. They will help analyze your situation and get you the help you need.
If you are an adult in or at risk of an abusive relationship, get help by contacting a local organization or contact a National Domestic Abuse Hotline, for example 1-800-799-7233. You can also contact friends and family members. It’s hard to ask for help, but you will be surprised to find that most people will enthusiastically want to get into a better situation.

, Many rapists think that they can simply overpower a victim and have their way with them. They are arrogant, but they are also wrong. The more you put up a fight, the better chances your attacker will give up and look for an easier target. Don't make yourself an easy target. Try using anything at your disposal to defend yourself — things everyone has, such as nails and fists, or everyday objects, such as umbrellas and rocks, to ward off the attacker.


The good news is that, as late as 2001, only 11% of would-be rapists used a weapon during the attempted rape.That means 9 out of 10 rapists had no more natural defense than you likely do. Carrying out a rape with a weapon means a lot more prison time.
If the rapist is carrying a weapon, follow your instincts and take cues from the rapist. If you survive the sexual assault, you've done the right thing., If you've got pepper spray handy, take it out and hold it out at arm's length, aiming for the attacker's eyes while shouting ""I've got pepper spray! I'll use it if I need to!"" If you don't have any pepper spray, you can try putting your hand in your bag and yelling the same threat — ""I've got pepper spray! I'll use it if I need to!"" — trying to outsmart the would-be attacker. Any rapist who's been stung by pepper spray before is very likely to think twice before assaulting you.

, An informal sampling of rapists in prison found that many would leave a target alone if she threatened to fight back. Say ""Stay away! I will fight back if you get closer!"" Rapists are looking for easy targets; people talking on their phones while walking, rifling through their bags, etc. If you show them you won't go down without a fight, you could scare them off.

, If an attacker wraps their arms around you or is close enough to touch, first try to pinch them in one of two places: inside the upper arm (between the elbow and the armpit) or the upper inner thigh. Pinch hard; pinch like your life depends on it (because it could!)

For context, try pinching yourself in either of these places. It hurts, doesn't it? And you're probably not even pinching as hard as you could.

, If your attacker is male, a swift blow to the genital area will cause an intense amount of pain, and will dissuade most would-be rapists from following through with their intentions. If your attacker is female, a kick or punch that lands on the vulva or clitoris will also cause considerable pain.


A square hit in the groin area often incapacitates the attacker. If they are vulnerable after the groin attack, try punching them at the front of the throat (think Adam's Apple, women are sensitive here too). This is also extremely painful, and should render the attacker useless for enough time for you to get to safety.

, Really stomp on their toes if you get the chance. If you have access to the attacker's fingers, try bending them back with force. Humans have a lot of nerve-endings in our toes and fingers, making them excellent defensive targets.

, This stands for Solar Plexus-Instep-Nose-Groin. First, elbow them in the solar plexus, stomp on their foot as hard as you can, when they let go, punch them or hit them using the palm of your hand in the nose, then knee them in the groin. This may give you enough time to run away.

, The urge to immediately shower or take a bath or otherwise clean yourself will often be very strong, but you should not do this. You are a walking evidence locker, so bag your clothes and get yourself to a hospital so that a rape kit can be taken. This will be vital in supporting your case later if you eventually decide you want to prosecute.

, Even if you do not want to prosecute, even if you don’t want anyone to know, even if you feel bad because you know the person, you should report your rape. Reporting is important, even if prosecution never happens, because it can serve as a red flag later if that person rapes again. It’s hard to relive a rape and the process of reporting a rape is rarely easy, but you should do it to protect both yourself and others.

, If you’ve been raped, even if you don’t want to report it or prosecute, you still should absolutely get a pregnancy test if you're a female and get tested for STDs and STIs no matter your gender. This is about protecting your own basic health, since some infections can be stopped in their tracks if intervention comes early.

, Again, even if you don’t plan on doing anything in terms of reporting or bringing charges, you should still take precautions for your own health. People who have been raped are at high risk of depression, suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental health problems, especially when they don’t get support. Call a rape crisis center or find and talk to a therapist. Both will be able to help you cope with the feelings that you’re having.

, You’ll have to decide, if you are raped, if you want to talk to your friends and family about it. Studies have shown that support from those close to you can play a huge role in helping you reach “normalcy” again. However, rape is a deeply personal experience and you shouldn’t feel like you have to talk about it if you don’t want to.

, If you are raped by someone you know, which is the most likely scenario, you should do everything in your power to get away from that person. They should not still be in your life. Being constantly exposed to your rapist puts you at higher risk for self-harm, depression, and a repeated attack. If you will not bring charges against them, move away, get a restraining order, or talk to CPS if you are young.

, An unconscious person cannot consent to sex. This also applies to sex you can't remember, either because you were blacked out or because you were unconscious. Just because you didn’t have to “experience” it in the traditional sense, doesn’t mean you weren’t raped.


Of course, before accusing someone of raping you in this way, you should look really hard at your own choices. Don’t use a serious matter as a cop-out for decision you know you made just because you regret it.

, When someone is drunk, they do not have the ability to consent. They are too unaware of what is going on to really understand what they are doing or agreeing to. Some people may also have been made too affectionate by the alcohol, just like how people on ecstasy will think they love everyone.

, Men can also be raped by women. In fact, as we discussed above, it might even be just as common in some places as women getting raped. If you are a male, and you were forced into having sex with a woman against your will, you were raped and you are entitled to protection under the law.

, Just because you are not penetrated in the normal sense does not mean that you weren’t raped. Any unwanted sexual contact is assault and you should report your rape.

, Even if there is no weapon present, rape is still rape. The authorities should understand this. The abuser may use many different kinds of fear tactics to keep a victim from putting up a big fight.

, Many victims don’t put up a fight when they are raped, out of fear of physical harm, blackmail, or other consequences. Just because you didn’t fight, doesn’t mean you weren't raped. All that matters is that you said “no”. The authorities will understand your concerns for your safety.

, Even if two people are married, it doesn’t mean that a wife has to have sex with her husband. This is accepted as law in most countries in the world. If your spouse forced you to have sex, you are entitled to prosecute if you want to.

, Even if you previously had consensual sex or even had consensual sex recently, that does not make all sex consensual between you. You are still protected by law and are entitled to help. All that matters is that you said “no”.

, We tend to excuse female teacher-male student sex, or sex between a male teacher and a female student that the student encouraged. However, there are lots of reasons why this isn’t as consensual as it may appear, the most important of which is that children cannot consent (even if they’re teenagers). The young brain is not developed enough to comprehend consequences.


Even for older teacher-student relationships, it is important to understand that a professor can abuse their position of authority, using it to intimidate a student into sex.

, At the end of the day, rape is just any sex that you don’t want. People need to understand that no means no. Beyond that, people also need to understand that getting a conscious “yes” is really what they need to be looking for, not just the absence of a no. For the safety of members of all genders, we should all work together to prioritize consent, so that rape becomes as uncommon as possible among all walks of life.

Store in a cool, dry place.,
Dispose of down the drain with water.",How to Formulate White Phenyle," For this recipe of concentrated white phenyle, you will be making a solution that is 70% pine oil and 30% emulsifier. To make it, you will need: pine oil concentrate (between 22%-26%), an emulsifier such as Emulsifier OP-95 or Pine Oil Emulsifier, and a bottle to contain the finished product.Pine oil and emulsifiers can be purchased online.
Make sure your container is large enough to hold the volume you are making. If you’re making a large quantity, you will need a larger container.
The recipe here is to make 1 liter of concentrated white phenyle.;
, You can calculate the amount of pine oil necessary to make a 70% solution or simply make 1 liter and measure out 700 milliliters. If you wanted to make 2 liters, you would double the amount (1.4 liters pine oil).


The easiest way to measure volumes is to use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup.

, You want the final solution to be 30% emulsifier, so you will add 300 milliliters to a final volume of 1 liter. Again, if you wanted to make 2 liters, simply double the amount of emulsifier (600 milliliters).


Clean out the graduated cylinder or measuring cup before measuring out a different solution.

, In a container large enough to hold both volumes, combine the measured volumes of pine oil and emulsifier. Stir well until the solution clears.The emulsifier will mix with the pine oil and together they will create a clear solution that has brownish-yellow tint to it.


At first, the solution will appear milky in color. This is normal. Continue to stir and then let it sit until the solution clears.
Once the solution clears you will have concentrated white phenyl.

, Concentrated white phenyle is usually diluted 1:40, but can be made as strong as a 1:20 dilution.For dilution, you will need concentrated white phenyle, water, a large plastic container, and a spoon or something to stir with.


You can make your own concentrated white phenyle or simply purchase it online.
The plastic container needs to be large enough to hold the volume of diluted solution that you will be making. If you get a container with a lid, you can simply shake the vessel instead of having to stir.

, To dilute a solution 1:40, you will use 39 liters of water and 1 liter of the concentrated solution. If you don’t need to make 40 liters worth of diluted white phenyl you can always do less.

, Measure out one liter of the concentrated solution and add it to the 39 liters of water. Stir the solution well into it is thoroughly combined. The solution should appear milky while stirring.


When a stable emulsion is formed, the solution will appear milky white and have a fresh pine scent.This solution can now be used to clean and disinfect your home.

, White phenyle is non-toxic to both humans and pets, but it is recommended to dilute before use.Because of its disinfectant properties, white phenyle is a good solution to use for cleaning floors and bathroom/kitchen surfaces.


White phenyle is safe to use on a variety of surfaces including glass, porcelain, wood, concrete, plastic, ceramic, etcAvoid ingestion and contact with eyes. Wash hands after use.

, It is recommended to store white phenyle in a cool, dry place away from flammable items. White phenyle is flammable, so it’s important to keep it away from any source of heat.Keep the container tightly closed to prevent spills.

, Instructions for disposal include using up the solution as intended and disposing of small amounts down the drain while running water. The label on your version of white phenyle may have more specific instructions on harmful dilutions and proper disposal.If you’re unsure about the concentration of your white phenyle, call the manufacturer and ask them about it.

Choose an eyeshadow or blush that’s the color you want.,
Mix some of the powder makeup with a clear lip product.,
Test the shade before applying to your lips.",How to Make Your Own Lip Color2," Look through your powder eye shadows and blushes to find one or more shades that is similar to the lip color that you have in mind. However, it’s important to make sure that the eye shadow and/or blush is safe to use on your lips.It’s usually best to use mineral makeup for mixing up a custom color with eyeshadow and blush because they’re often made with all-natural ingredients.

, After you’ve found the powder product(s) in the right shade, take a clear lip gloss or balm and use a lip brush, small metal spatula, or cotton swab to mix some of the powder(s) into it. Blend until the powder is completely blended into the clear lip product.If you’re making the lip color for one-time use, you can mix the powder and lip product on the back of your hand, a makeup palette, or a plastic plate or dish. If you want to make a lip color to use in the future, mix the two in a small plastic pot or a metal makeup pan.
It’s easiest to use loose powder eye shadows and blushes to mix into the lip gloss or balm because you can just sprinkle them in. If you’re using a pressed shadow or blush, you’ll need to use a butter knife or nail file to scrape some out of the pan.
If you’re mixing the powder product with a clear lip gloss, it’s easiest to use one that comes in a squeeze tube because you can squeeze out the amount you need. If you’re using a gloss that comes in a tube with a doe foot applicator, wipe the excess product off the applicator onto your palette or into your container or on the back of your hand.
If you’re mixing the powder product with a clear lip balm, it’s easiest to use a formula that comes in a pot so you can just scoop out the amount you need. If you’re using a balm that comes in stick form, you’ll need to use a butter knife or nail file to scrape off some of the balm from the stick.

, Once the powder product is fully mixed into your clear lip product, use your finger or a lip brush to test the color on the back of your hand. If you’re happy with the shade, you can apply it to your lips. If the color isn’t exactly what you want, mix in a little more of one or more of the powder products to tweak it.A custom lip color made with a clear gloss or balm will be on the sheer side. You’ll have to layer on the color if you want it be more opaque.

",How to Make a Ninja Mask3," Your t-shirt should be one that you are alright with not wearing again. This will be the material that you make your mask out of., Lay your head as flat as possible against a piece of large paper and have your friend trace the shape of your head with a pen or pencil. You do not need to trace the details of your head, just the general round shape of your head and your neck.If you do not have someone to help you trace your head with, measure the length of your head from the top of your head to your collar bones. Also measure the back of your head to the tip of your nose. Using a pen or a pencil, draw a profile of your head facing the right. It should look like a large, thick ‘P’.

, Using a pencil or fabric pen, trace the silhouette onto the t-shirt. You should place the silhouette against a sewn side of the t-shirt (like under the armpit of one of the shirt arms)., Make sure that you are cutting both the front and the back of the t-shirt.

, Make sure you do not sew the straight bottom part of the mask as that is where your neck will come out of.

, Cut a triangle of the fabric out so that both of your eyes and a small portion of the top of your nose will be visible when you put the mask on. The triangle cut should be made at the front of the ‘P’ shape.,"

Style your curls with your fingers.",How to Curl Your Hair With Paper Bags," You can either create these curls after a shower, or just use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. It’s important that you work with damp hair, rather than wet hair. If your hair is too wet when you begin, the paper will soak up the water and will not hold your hair properly.For African American hair, start with dry hair. Spritz a little bit of water, oil, and a moisturizing product onto each section of hair. You can also put a bit of product into the palm of your hand, and massage it into each section of hair as you go.;
, Use a wide-tooth comb to make sure your hair is tangle-free before starting. Damp hair is vulnerable to damage and breakage, so it’s important to use a comb rather than a brush.Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up, getting out the tangles from each section before moving on.

, To simplify this technique, it’s best to section out your hair so you can work with one section at a time. Depending on how much hair you have, you may spit it into a bottom and top layer, or a bottom, middle, and top layer. Use hair clips to pin the top sections up. This will make the process much more manageable.

, If you’re using brown paper lunch bags, tear or cut strips down the length of the bag, cutting off the bottoms so that you have one, smooth strip.If you’re using larger paper bags, make sure to cut your strips so that they are all about 8-10 inches.

, For best results, use about 1-inch sections of hair. Place your damp hair, or your hair with product, in the middle of the paper strip and fold one side of the strip over, so that your hair is sandwiched between the two sides. Then, slide the strip down to the bottom of the section of hair, so that you’ll be able to roll up the entire strand., This part can be a little tricky to master. Basically, you want to begin rolling your hair around the middle of the paper strip, where the two sides have overlapped. Practice rolling the hair around the folded paper strip until if feels secure.For African American hair, you may prefer to create twists in your hair, and then roll the twist around the paper strip as outlined above. To create the twist, split the section of hair into two parts, and wrap them around each other. Then, roll that twisted section with the paper., Once your hair is securely around the paper strip, slowly begin rolling it up the section. There should be two loose ends of paper sticking out on either side of the roll. Continue rolling until you’ve gone as high as you’d like the curl to go.You can go all the way to your scalp if you want volume in the roots, or you may leave a few inches of straighter hair at the top of your head. That’s completely up to you!

, Once you’ve rolled as much hair as you want to curl, you need to secure the paper strip. Do this by tying the two loose ends together.Make sure you create a secure knot that will hold your hair firmly in place while it dries.


If you’re unable to form a knot with the two loose ends of paper, you may need to work with longer strips.

, Once you’ve finished the bottom section of hair, let down your top section. Repeat the same process until you’ve wrapped and tied every single piece of hair in a paper strip.When you’re finished, double check that all of your papers are securely knotted.


The more paper curls you create, the better you’ll be at this technique.

, You can create your paper bag curls before you go to sleep, and let them dry overnight. If you’re going to be lounging around the house, you can also certainly put your curlers in in the morning and let them dry throughout the day. The most important thing is that your hair is completely dry before removing the strips.If you’re in a rush, you can run a blow dryer over your curlers. Keep your blow dryer on low or medium heat, and make sure to apply a heat protectant to your hair if you plan to do this.

, Once you’ve felt your curls and determined your hair is completely dry, it’s time to untie your paper bags. Gently undo each knot and slowly unravel your rolled hair. Do this for your entire head. When you think you’ve untied them all, run your hands through your hair to ensure there isn’t any paper left in your hair.Keep a recycling bin near by so you can toss your paper strips into it as you remove them.

, Don’t brush your curls out, because you’ll undo the structure of each curl and create a frizzy mess. Instead, gently run your hands through your hair, playing with your curls until you’ve smoothed and tamed them to your satisfaction. If you like, you can spritz a little bit of hairspray on your curls to ensure they hold up for the entire day.Your curls may be tight when you first remove the paper bags, but over time they will loosen and fall into looser, softer curls.

Tell him he is wrong.,
Demand proof.,
Point out bad grammar.,
Patronize him.,
Cite ridiculous, irrelevant sources.,
Point out pettiness.,
Make it personal.",How to Annoy Argumentative People2," Don't back this up with any facts that can be debated. Just tell him he is wrong and refuse to provide any further explanation. Nothing will anger an argumentative person more than hearing they are wrong, especially if they are right.

, Even if the other person's argument seems to be valid, demand proof for any claims that they make. Refuse to debate the issue further until he proves his claim to you. Try to create as much legwork as possible for your antagonist. Make it too exhausting and time consuming to continue to have an argument with you.

, If your opponent happens to use words incorrectly while arguing, be sure to stop him and point it out. This will not only disrupt his momentum while speaking, but make him feel intellectually inferior as well.

, Be as condescending as possible to make yourself seem superior. For example, you can offer to use smaller words so he can understand you better.


Roll your eyes. Look up and to one side and slowly move your eyes until you see the opposite side of the room. It helps to shake your head slightly while rolling the eyes. This expression will show that you find your opponent ridiculous and stupid.

, Cite movies, television shows, or other completely unrelated figures as authoritative voices.Quoting song lyrics also works great. This method is very difficult to combat as he will first have to figure out whether you are serious or not before he can come up with a response.


For example, if someone is trying to start an argument of American foreign policy, a possible response could be, ""Well, as Billy Joel said, 'We didn't start the fire.'""

, If the argument is over something that is not important, be sure to point out that your antagonist is blowing it out of proportion due to their mean nature. Argumentative people like to act as though every argument is important because it is really just about being right. If you show your opponent how their arguing can be viewed as a fault in their character, it may make them more reluctant to engage you further.

, Forget whatever topic the argument might be about and focus on becoming insulting and rude.For example, if you begin to lose a debate about poverty you could say, ""You should spend less time worrying about poverty and more time figuring out a new hair style."" This kind of attack does nothing for winning the actual argument, but hurling insults can often quiet down and humiliate aggressive opponent. Of course, it could also end up turning into a physical fight, so watch out.

Understand when it is safe to forego surgery.,
Heal your dog's torn ACL ligament by reducing its body weight.,
Attempt to restrict your dog's activity.,
Try using a towel sling.",How to Heal a Torn Dog ACL Without Surgery1," Both surgical and non-surgical (conservative) methods can be used to treat ACL. A combination of both methods is usually helpful for the dog. However, the type of therapy recommended varies based on body size, body condition, and severity of lameness of your dog.


A dog under 20 kilograms may not be a good candidate for surgical procedures.;
, The ACL is meant to stabilize the leg and provide support during weight bearing activities. High body weight is a risk factor and a leading cause of ACL injury, because of the extra stress placed on the ligament by an overweight body. You can easily accelerate your dog's healing process by reducing the body weight of your dog. Try lowering your dog's body weight with a combination of diet and exercise.


To reduce the body weight of your dog, decrease its calorie intake at least 60%.
Don't reduce the calorie intake suddenly, but rather feed your dog smaller portions more throughout the whole day.

To minimize any digestive upset, try to ease your dog into the new diet gradually. Make sure to monitor the outcome of your weight reducing program regularly.


Be sure include regular, but non-vigorous, exercise for your dog. The exercise may include walking or running.

In the case of a severe ACL injury with inflammation, exercise should be postponed until after you give your dog some NSAIDs to reduce pain.
If your dog has a severely torn ACL, specialized hydrotherapy (walking/swimming in water) is recommended.


Please consult with your vet to get an appropriate exercise list based on the clinical condition of your dog.
Due to lowered pressure on knee joint, your dog will be able to heal its ligament faster.

, Full rest and limited activity will give your dog's body the chance to heal. Lower inflammation due to rest will allow the body to heal itself naturally. Some veterinarians advise you totally restrict the activity of your dog, while others advise some limited exercise.


You should not allow your dog to jump up to catch a ball or Frisbee or to jump out of a truck or off a porch.
You can practice a short-leash walk with your dog only.

, Sometimes, using a towel as a sling under the hip of your dog to support its weight can be helpful to speed up healing. The towel sling is commercially available, or you can make one easily by using a bath towel or recycled children's jacket in your home.


For using a bath towel, you should cut a large bath towel in half and apply it under the lower abdomen of your dog. By applying upward pressure, while holding both ends of the towel, you can help your dog walk.
Commercially available athletic bandage can also be used for this purpose.
If you use a recycled jacket, you should cut the sleeves so that the jacket fits on your dog’s abdomen.

Identify the clauses you need to change.,
Copy the format of your existing will.,
Keep the language you don't want to change.,
Remove and add beneficiaries where appropriate.,
Sign your new will.",How to Remove a Beneficiary from Your Will1," If you want to revoke your old will and create a new one, read through your original will carefully. Note the places in which the person's name appears as a beneficiary.Creating a new will is one of the most straightforward ways to make any changes to your old one.
If you're making a new will, you also have the ability to change anything else that seems outdated or no longer appropriate.
Since you probably will be copying most of the language from your original will into your new one (unless you have substantial changes planned), take care to highlight the portions you need to change.
Keep in mind that you may not be allowed to disinherit certain people, such as your spouse or your children, under the laws of some states. Contact an estate planning attorney if you think this might be an issue.;
, Since you already have a will, you generally can draft a new one on your own – even if you had an attorney draft the original. However, if you do plan to draft a new will, you may want to contact the attorney who drafted the original and let them know what you're planning to do.You don't necessarily have to get that attorney to draft your new will. However, they may have copies of your old will, and you want to make sure those are destroyed.
If you're creating your will using a word processing application on your computer, simply copy the font, paragraph styles, and margins that were used in your original will.
There's no need to change the title of your will, or to otherwise acknowledge the previous will. Rather, simply include a sentence in the first paragraph that says ""With this will, I revoke any and all wills or codicils I previously executed.""

, If the only thing you're doing is removing a beneficiary, you should be able to copy everything else in your will verbatim. Be careful changing any language you don't need to change, as you may unwittingly alter the effect of the will.Remember that a will is first and foremost a legal document. Even if you don't understand some of the language and think it's unimportant, include it anyway.
One factor of legalese many people don't understand is how redundant it seems. However, in the context of wills, these seemingly redundant phrases often are necessary to pass down your assets exactly the way you want.
This is particularly true if you had an attorney draw up your original will. Changing their language may result in unintended consequences.

, Ideally, you should be able to simply remove the name of the person you want to remove as a beneficiary, and put another name in their place.If you don't want to replace the person, but want to give those assets to another beneficiary already listed, you might want to talk to an attorney about how to rework the language so your new will has that effect.
You may have given everything in your estate that wasn't specifically given to someone else to one beneficiary.
If that's the case, and if you no longer wish the specific bequest to go to a particular individual, you can simply remove the clause giving that asset to the beneficiary you want to remove.

, Once you've finished drafting your new will, look over it carefully to make sure you don't have any typos or other errors. You may want to have an estate planning attorney look over it as well.When you're satisfied with your draft, print it up for signing. You must follow the same formalities you did when you signed your original will.
If you don't remember what you did when you signed your original will, look at the document itself. Note the number of witness signatures and whether there's a notary seal.
The entire proceeding of executing a will typically must be all at once. If you're required to have two witnesses, you may want to call the same people who witnessed your original will.
Once you've signed your new will, do everything you can to destroy any existing copies of your old will, so there isn't any confusion.

Capricorns like to be in charge, but will listen to reason. Instead of trying to get your way by arguing the loudest, have rational discussions when tough issues come up.

Plan it out.,
Get a physical.,
Be clear about why you're becoming a vegan.,
Investigate the science behind nutrition, food and health.,
Ask questions.",How to Become a Vegan1," Just because a vegan diet is low in calories and fats (and completely cholesterol free), that doesn't mean it's healthy. Although chances are most vegan things will be better for you than what the typical American eats. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says a vegan diet is only healthy if it's well-rounded and planned out. If you're considering going vegan for health reasons, you might also want to consider buying organic.If it's not, you're missing out on vitamins and nutrients that your body needs to function. So do yourself a favor and do it right.


Do your homework. What foods that you like (that are vegan-friendly) do you need to start putting in your diet? Nuts? Quinoa? Beans? Be sure to consider whether or not you think it is important to cut out honey, gelatin, etc. As well as if you want to be a ""full vegan"" or just a dietary vegan. There are animal fats in soaps, there may be leather or the like in your shoes and clothes, etc. Does animal testing bother you? Some products and foods are tested on animals and that can also be something to avoid.
Get online. There are tons of websites catered to budding vegans that are full of recipes, quizzes, fun facts, and interactive tools to get you on board. They'll even do a week's worth of recipes for you!Utilize what you have at your disposal to ensure you're partaking in a balanced diet.;
, Visit your doctor and make sure you are in decent physical shape. Tell your doctor your plans to become a vegan and ask if there are any considerations to take into account given your medical history. For example, those with anemia need to be particularly attentive to get enough iron in their vegan diet. Some doctors aren't well educated in veganism and mistakenly believe it is unhealthy or that you can't get enough protein or calcium. You only need about 50 grams of protein if you're a female, 60 if you are a male. 1000 to 1200 milligrams of calcium are needed depending on your age. Calcium-fortified plant milks and orange juices are an excellent substitute for dairy products as a source of calcium.


Ask your doctor how to maintain a balanced diet with your new eating habits. They'll be able to shed some light on how to obtain the necessary vitamins and minerals you need to function on top of your game.

, This is a huge change in your lifestyle, not to be taken lightly as a trend. Having your reasons lined out will not only ensure that you don't waste your time and efforts doing something you're not really passionate about, but it'll also help you stick with it. And answer questions when people raise an eyebrow at your dining choices!


If there's a particular essay, picture, or quote that reinforces your desire to become a vegan, print it out and put it in a place where you'll see it often, like your refrigerator.
In case anyone asks, the vegan diet is appropriate for all lifestyles (as long as it's done well). Athletes, pregnant women, children, and seniors all can benefit from a healthy vegan diet.No need to defend yourself when the in-laws start the inquisition. You've got science.

, You don't have to be a nutritionist or medical doctor to understand the background of healthful living. Learning as much as you can about nutrition, food and health will only do you good. You'll become an expert in no time when it comes to plant-based alternatives.


You'll still get your protein if know what to look for. Luckily, plenty of plants are high in it: tofu, beans, nut, seeds, quinoa and whole grains are all protein-packers.When you buy soy, almond, or rice milk, make sure it's fortified with calcium. Same goes for orange juice!
Avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil are all good sources of healthy fats.Those are necessary too!

, Real vegans (or a buddy with similar interests) can help you on your new adventure. Surf for communities online or look for a local club or group in your area. The easiest way to do this is to find a new favorite vegan restaurant, a favorite table, and go from there.


The Vegan Society has a great website that's full of resources, news, and even helps you shop! Talk about an exciting, addictive hobby. Who needs Pinterest?

Keep your pins highly relevant in the group board.,
Consider starting your group board in secret.,
Keep guidelines very simple and open for the members.,
Remove repeat offenders from the group if required.,
Mention your contact details.",How to Use Pinterest Group Boards for Ecommerce Website," As a group admin, it is your task to police them and ensure that your group keeps pulling the interest of the members. Irregular and careless monitoring can make your pins go off-brand, out-of-fashion and thus, ignored. This is even important in a group with lots of pinners. The best way to avoid your pins being ignored is to screen every pinner before adding them to the group. Make sure that all pins are not spammy and have decent quality content.;
, This step has a number of benefits. By opening a group in private, you get an opportunity to collect niche relevant pins for it. Once you think you have enough pins; you can open your group and start sending out invites to the users. This way, you will have some content in-hand to attract pinners to become valued contributors.

, For you are as a group admin, it is important to set a few rules for your board members. You can mention them in the ""Description"" box on your board. There should be a ""no spamming policy"" but make sure that you don’t just write ""no spamming"" and stop. You should mention straightforward anti-spamming guidelines and keep checking your pins regularly. Then, you should also have guidelines related to how many pins a pinner can contribute in a day. This will also help you maintain the quality of your board.

, By removing those who continually break your rules and ignore guidelines, you send a message to your group that you are not there to tolerate any spam activity on your board. You need to remove everyone who creates a nuisance or violates the spirit of your group. You will also have to pay attention towards the quality of your pins. One of the biggest drawbacks of Pinterest boards is that the board members can send out invites to other members to join your board. Thus, you have to control your board very strictly and this is very important because Pinterest reserves the right to shut down any board that has been marked as ""Spam"" a fixed number of times.

, You need to make sure that you mention your contact details in the ""Description"" box on the board you manage. This will encourage members and non-members to contact you via email and share their views and ideas etc.

Build family traditions with your kids.,
Provide opportunities for your kids to spend time together.,
Give your kids time away from each other.,
Help your kids overcome differences.,
Encourage helping behaviors.",How to Improve Your Children's Sibling Relationships2," One of the great ways you can help strengthen your children’s bond is by encouraging them to participate together in various holiday outings and annual events. For instance, supply your kids with a pumpkin and allow them (when they reach an age where they are able) to cut it into a jack-o-lantern (with adult supervision). During the winter, build a snowman in the yard, or provide them with the means to construct their own gingerbread houses., If your kids never have opportunities to bond and spend time together, they won’t have a strong relationship. Take your kids bowling, or to the park, or just allow them time to play in their rooms together. These shared experiences can give your kids’ relationship a solid foundation.Young children who play together will fight at some point, too. But unless their conflicts occur frequently (at a rate of more than one conflict per five positive interactions), don’t encourage them to stay apart from each other.
If you know that your kids get cranky and are more likely to fight at certain times of day – for instance, in the late evening – don’t schedule joint playtime during those times.

, Growing up, especially in a small house, kids might feel that they are overexposed to their siblings. This feeling that their siblings are always around might make them feel trapped and frustrated, leading to a deteriorating relationship. It is just as important, therefore, to give your kids time away from each other as it is to provide time when they can be together.Instead of taking both children everywhere with you or insisting that they play together when one or both don’t really want to, provide opportunities where they can be apart for a time.
For instance, take one child to the zoo this weekend, then take your other child to the baseball game next weekend. That way, you’ll be able to spend an equal amount of time with each even though the time spent isn’t always together.

, If there is a significant difference in your kids’ backgrounds, find ways to help them bond that acknowledge and accommodate their differences. For example, if one child is 5 and the other is 15, it might seem hard to find ways for them to bond. Identify activities that they both like to do and facilitate opportunities to enjoy these activities together.For instance, if both children enjoy baseball, allow the older child to take the younger one to a baseball game.
Without relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent, encourage your older child to watch out for their younger sibling in certain situations. For instance, if both children ride the same bus to school, encourage the much older child to protect the younger one.

, If your siblings feel like they are in competition with each other, then it may be difficult for them to be supportive of each other. To improve their relationship with each other, try to encourage helping behaviors among your children.

For example, you might encourage your children to be supportive of each other during stressful times, such as before a big game that one of your children will be playing in, or before one of your children has a big test at school.
Try saying something like, “Don’t forget to wish your sister good luck on her history test today! She is really worried about it and it will mean a lot to her if you give her some words of encouragement.” Or, “Let’s all cheer for Danny when he comes out onto the field! It will make him happy to know we are all here to support him.”

Make your bed each morning.,
Hang up clothes or put them in a hamper right away.,
Dust and sweep.,
Tidy up for 15 minutes each night.,
Clean out closets and hard-to-reach spaces weekly.,
Put things away as you use them.",How to Keep Your Room Tidy1," Making your bed will instantly make your room look and feel tidier. Your bed is a central figure in your room's space. If your bed looks tidy, the rest of your room will as well. Make a conscious effort to make your bed each morning after waking up.A good way to launch this habit is by completing it first thing. Before heading to the shower or the kitchen, for example, simply straighten the sheets and blankets right away.
Making the bed really only takes a minute or so, but if time is still an issue, pull the blanket right over your pillows to at least give the illusion of tidiness. You can skip tucking in the corners and such if you're pressed for time.;
, Before bed at night, you may quickly undress in your room and then slip on pajamas. To keep things neat, try to hang anything that can be worn again. If it can’t, drop it right into the hamper.


If you don't already have a hamper or laundry basket in your room, it's a good idea to move one into the bedroom. You're more likely to remember to toss dirty clothing in the hamper if it's sitting right next to you as a reminder.
If you don’t have the space to hang more items, folding works just as well. Neatly fold all items and store in a designated space like a drawer or closet shelf.

, Bedrooms accrue a lot of dust and dirt, as with any room in your home. Make a point of dusting and sweeping your bedroom a few times a week to keep the floors and shelves looking tidy.You can keep a small broom in your bedroom. You can use a broom with microfiber cloths, allowing you to simply run the broom across the floor to clean up excess dirt.
You should also strive to remove any dust from places like the bedpost, drawers, and bookshelves. To make things easier for yourself, keep a dust rag or brush in your room so you'll remember to periodically dust when you have the chance.

, If you incorporate cleaning into your daily routine, you're more likely to keep your room tidy. Add 15 minutes of nightly cleaning to your bedtime routine. Sometime before brushing your teeth and slipping into your pajamas, do a quick 15 minute clean of your bedroom.Pick up any items off the floor, like clothing or books. Put them in their proper space.
If a surface is looking dusty, quickly dust it off. You can also do a quick sweep before bed if there's any dirt or debris on your floor.
It may also help to set out the clothing you'll be wearing tomorrow. This way, you'll make less mess in the morning when getting ready to head out the door.
You may find you'll fall asleep better when you start cleaning before bed. You may feel more settled and relaxed going to bed in a freshly cleaned room.

, In addition to basic cleaning, you'll want to clean out closets and other hard-to-reach spaces. Closets can become messy and cluttered quickly, as you often neglect to clean space you cannot directly see. Floor spaces blocked by your bed and other furniture also get messy.Open up the closet and look for any clutter. Some clothing may have fallen off the hanger. You may have tucked an unwanted item in the closet temporarily. Put these items in their proper place. Vacuum or sweep the closet floor and dust off the shelves.
Clean under furniture. Move your bed, desk, and any other furniture aside. Retrieve any items that were caught under these pieces of furniture and put them away. Then, vacuum or sweep the floor space.

, If you want to keep your room tidy, you'll need to stay on top of cleaning. A good way to do so is to make sure you put away items as you use them. If you read in your room, put the book back on your shelf when you're done. If you had a snack in your room, put the dishes back in the kitchen when you finish eating. If you make an effort to clean up as you go, your room will stay tidy without too much extra work.

Pick your battles.,
Ask what they want you to do differently.,
Stick to your guns.,
Keep your distance.",How to Deal With a Perfectionist at Work2," It is important to decide when you should take a stand and when you should let something go. This can be difficult, but taking a moment to consider how important the issue is may help you to decide when to take a stand or not.


The idea here is to keep perspective. Since this is a co-worker and not a boss, agreeing with them doesn't necessarily mean that you actually have to follow their suggestions. Although it might seem overly passive, just saying ""yes"" and moving on with your life can diminish conflict between you and your colleague and diminish stress on your part.Remember that agreeing with the person doesn't give them power over you. In fact, it does the opposite, because it frees you from focusing on the person’s demands.

, Sometimes a perfectionist may hide their insecurities by using criticism.This can be upsetting, but it might help to remind yourself that this is a defense mechanism. The person may just be lashing out at you because he or she feels insecure about something.


By asking your colleague about how they would prefer something to be done, you can disarm those insecurities. Try signaling to them that you are a person who cares about their feelings.When they understand that you value their feelings, it makes them feel more secure, which makes them less likely to criticize you in the future.
For example, you might say something like, “It seems like you are upset about the outcome of this project. Do you want to talk about it?”

, If the issue is important to you, then you are right to stick to your guns. It is unlikely that your supervisors and co-workers are unaware of your colleague's perfectionist tendencies. If something is important to you and you disagree, you have a right to say so.


Disagreeing doesn't mean arguing. State your disagreement and move on.The disagreement doesn't have to define the relationship if you don't let it. Try saying something like, ""I respect what you’re saying, I think we are just coming at it from different perspectives.""
If they seem intent on having an argument with you, then walk away. It's unlikely your colleagues and supervisors are unaware of your co-worker's ways. Therefore, it's unlikely you will get blamed for not wanting to get drawn into an argument with them.

, This simplest way to avoid conflict is sometimes to avoid the person you conflict with. When you do have to work together, remind them that everybody has their own job, and that you have to do yours to the boss' satisfaction, and not theirs.


You can always disengage. If your odious co-worker is going on about an inconsequential detail, just remain noncommittal.
Start off with ""ok,"" ""I see,"" or the old standby, ""huh.""
Then make your escape--""I didn't know you felt that way. So interesting. One of these days, we're going to have to do lunch and you can tell me all about it. Gotta go.""

Ask him if he’s single.,
Tell him directly how you feel.,
Ask him out on a date.,
Text him your feelings.,
Tell one of his friends how you feel, and let the friend deliver the message.",How to Tell a Man You Like Him3," Naturally, he’ll wonder why you’re asking. And if you’ve been showing him a lot of attention or flirting before throwing out this question, it will be obvious you’re asking because you like him. Even if you already know he’s single (because you may have asked his friends), you can still ask. Look at it as just another way to let him know you’re interested.


You can bring it up casually during conversation after you’ve talked for a while. If you’ve flirted with him and noticed him responding to you, you can be upfront and ask earlier. Especially if you sense the feeling may be mutual. You could ask him directly: “Are you single?” “Do you have a girlfriend?” Or you could ask in a more playful manner: “So where’s your girlfriend?” “Are you here alone?”
Be prepared with a follow-up response once he answers. If he says he is single, you can reply by saying “Good” and smile. Or if you’re feeling bold, you can lean towards him and say in a low voice, “I’m in luck then.” If he says he’s in a relationship, it’s best to be respectful and back away at this point. Instead of ending the conversation abruptly, and to keep the moment light, you can tease him by saying, “Darn it! I’m too late.”

, Rather than beating around the bush or throwing out hints, hoping he gets the picture, gather up the courage to let him know that you like him. Arrange a moment where the two of you can have time to talk privately. You can make this moment as serious or as lighthearted as you feel. What you say and how you say it all depends on how much you like him.


If you’re bold, be straightforward and say, “Hey, I like you. I'd like to be more than friends.” You’re essentially pinning him in a corner with this method. But you’ll know rather quickly if he also likes you or not.
Tell him you think he’s cute and suggest you both should hang out more. While this is also a direct way to let a man know you like him, it’s also a more casual way to express your feelings. It takes the pressure off of him to respond appropriately since you’re only suggesting you have more fun together. Try saying, “I think you’re cute and a lot of fun. We should hang out more.”

, If you’re confident, but still don’t want to directly express your feelings, ask him out on a date. You can do this either in person, over the phone, or via text. Let him know you really enjoy his company and would like to spend more time getting to know him better. You could say, “I’ve had a really great time with you lately. You’re a lot of fun. I’d love to spend more time with you. Just the two of us. Would you like to go out sometime?” Have an outing already in mind before you ask. You’re asking him out. You don’t want to turn the tables on him and have him do all the planning.

, Maybe you can’t yet muster up the courage to tell him face to face. Or maybe you fumble over your words when you’re nervous. That’s okay because texting is fine.


You can send him a text message expressing your feelings as if you were standing in front him. You can make your message either serious or lighthearted, depending on how much you like him. Here’s an example of lighthearted message: “I think you’re really hot. Want to go out sometime?” If you’re feelings are a little more intense, try this: “I have a confession: I can’t stop thinking about you. I think you’re really cute and funny. Maybe you feel the same? If so, let’s go out sometime to get to know each other better.”
If his feelings aren’t the same, he has the unfortunate ability to ignore your text all together, pretending he never got it. Be prepared for this possibility. And also be prepared for the awkward moments that may follow if you happen to run into him later. You may have to pretend as if you never sent it, or you’ll have to muster up the courage and confront him in person about the text message and your feelings.

, If you’re close to his friends, you can pick one to confide in about your feelings. They’ll likely be able to tell you if your friend may feel the same. And they definitely won’t hesitate to pass on the message for you."

Consider writing fan fiction for existing games or television shows or short detective stories.,
Make sure you have enough time.,
Day 1: Planning.,
Day 2: Writing the Introduction.,
Day 3-5 Writing the Climbing Action.,
Days 6 and 7 Writing the Climax.,
Day 8 Writing the Conclusion.,
Days 9 and 10 Patching the Holes.",How to Write a Novel in 10 Days or Less," The reason for this is that you would not have much time for characterization and details, which are essential in writing good novels. Depending on the amount of time you are willing to give, you can produce anything from a short 5000-word story to a popular 50,000-word fan fiction.;
, If you are the type of person who works 9 to 5 every weekday, consider delaying your novel-writing ambitions for a later date. It's better to do this when you are on holiday, or have a long weekend. For even a 10,000-word short story, you need to put in a lot of work-possibly a good 12 hours if you're not a professional writer. Prepare to put aside at least 3-4 hours of your time every day. With that in mind, you are ready to begin.

, You have to PLAN. 95% of writers don't plan enough before they write, leading to anti-climatic endings and abandoned works that have good potential. That is exactly why there is 1 Dan Brown and 1 million anonymous writers who have 1 article on their blog that's never been read. You have to plan. Start by thinking what kind of novel you wish to write. Estimate how long you want it to be. Then come up with a good plot. You can do this by brainstorming on a vanguard sheet. Write down different ideas you want in your story and cut them out, then rearrange the thought bubbles to form a plotline. Remember, a good plot has to have the 4 Cs: Characterization, Climbing action, Climax and Conclusion. If you plan on writing a short story from scratch, make sure you think up each of your characters properly. Write down any character traits you want them to have, and imagine their physical appearance in your mind. That way, it is much easier to describe them. That is why you should start by writing fan fiction: a lot less scene-setting and characterization is required. Now that you have your ideas in place, you should read through the thought bubbles and look for any loopholes. If one idea jumps to the next too quickly, try connecting them with another idea. Remember that you may have many good ideas, but you can never include all of them. For a good plot, you have to sacrifice a potentially good idea or two in order for the story to flow smoothly. If you have extra time after this, you should probably write a 'chapter guide'. Make little boxes on a piece of paper for each chapter you wish to write, and write down in point form what you wish to convey to your reader in each box. If you think your plot is plausible, you are ready to start writing. You can always make little tweaks here and there along the way, so don't spend too long thinking up the perfect plot at the planning stage.

, It is always important to have a good prologue or introduction in your novel. A good introduction must always have a good 'hook' to capture your reader's attention. A good hook always describes the scene in vivid detail. Imagine your reader as a Martian who has never been to Earth before. Paint down each minute detail of the scene through the character's perspective. Emotions are also extremely important. Write down what the main character is feeling. Let your reader identify with your characters. That is the secret to a good hook. When you are done with your hook, move on to characterization. Tell your reader what each character is like. It is always good to give examples. For example, instead of saying 'Professor Jackson is an extremely talented, yet arrogant person,' say 'Professor Jackson glanced at his watch. 8.55am. 'Right on time,' he thought. He never failed to be late for work, just so that he could look for the thousandth time at his countless certificates of outstanding contribution for everything from the discovery of antimatter to atomic structure research. This was to make sure he would not leave out a single one when boasting at the pub later that day.' The show-not-tell technique never fails to work. Also, if you are writing a fan fiction, you do not need to dwell on characterization as the characters are already well-known. Another important aspect of the introduction is to tell your reader the main conflict. Every good novel has a central conflict that the main characters try to solve, and this has to be clear to the reader by the end of the first two or three chapters.

, From the introduction, steadily build up the action to the climax. If you want, you can also focus on and develop the relationship between the characters, although this is not necessary for a short story. Make sure the main character(s) face a few minor conflicts while making their way to the central problem. Remember, a good novel does not have only one climax, but several minor conflicts leading up to the climax. It is important to build up the action bit by bit so that the reader won't lose interest before the climax. Some conflict ideas you might like to consider would be some of the non-main characters being in a perilous situation where the main character has to save them or one of the good guys turning out to be a traitor.

, The climbing action should have led the characters right up to the climax. This is when the main character jumps into action, and confronts the antagonist. Make sure to include lots of details, dialogue and emotions to make this part exciting. Inner emotional conflicts of the main character never fail to work. Remember that this is the final battle, and you have to put a great deal of effort into it. Make sure that you have done proper planning before this. Most writers who haven't planned get stuck here and have to resort to a cheesy ending. That is the last thing you want. Make sure there is a good deal of action. If you haven't been writing much details, this is the time to plonk it all in. Go for it. It's now or never.

, After the climax is over and the main conflict resolved, the main characters can go back to normal. Don't make it overly dramatic, but try to give your story the ending you desire. There shouldn't be too much action, but emotions have to be there. Whether you want to portray those last words and emotions of the main character's lover as she dies from a bullet wound or depicting the protagonist returning to his tranquil home, the emotions have to be there.

, If you've gotten so far without getting stuck, give yourself a good pat on the back. However, don't quit now — you're nearly done! You have to patch up the loopholes for your audience to get a satisfying read. Scan through your story quickly for any grammatical, spelling or punctuation errors you have missed and correct them. Then read in detail, and improve on any areas which you think where more details can be added or redundant portions should be removed. If there are loopholes in the plot, try to patch them up as best as you can. Lastly, get a friend or family member to read through your story and give you any comments. There is always room for improvement, so be humble and make changes where necessary. Proof-read one last time and Ta-da! You're done!

Care about your hygiene.,
Hit the gym!,
Always wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner that matches your hair type.,
Pamper yourself!,
Wear tasteful make-up.,
Get some fashion sense!,
Be nice and smile.",How to Be One of the Best Looking Girls in Your Class," Take a shower to wash your body every day. Use a matching shower gel and body lotion, and exfoliate weekly. Brush your teeth and tongue 2-3 times a day with whitening toothpaste, use floss and possibly mouthwash. However, if you have marks on your teeth from braces, go and see the dentist to see what can be done. Use deodorant or anti-perspirant that smells good, don't forget to spray your feet and use perfume on pulse points!;
, It boosts your confidence and you will be toned and fit in no time. You don't have to go to the gym; you could take yoga classes, jog or take dance classes. Try to do two sessions of weights and three of cardio per week.

, For example, greasy hair usually needs clarifying/volumizing products, and dry hair needs more nourishment. Wash your hair at 3-4 times a week. Refrain from cheap products, as they probably won't help your hair. Always comb/brush your hair, as it must look neat and be really clean. You can also change your hairstyle, and do different things with it, like loose curls, poker-straight, up-dos, clips, head bands... Loose, ""bedhead"" layers are in, as well. Long, lush locks with a sweeping side fringe are fashionable and very womanly. Always choose a hair-style that suits your face shape and lifestyle. Use a deep-conditioning/hot oil treatment weekly.

, Feeling good makes you automatically look good. Take a relaxing bath, have a facial, pedicure and manicure weekly. All of these can be done at home or at a salon. If at home, use skin products that match your skin's needs; like an oil-free moisturizer for oily skin.

, Never exaggerate or over-do makeup application, as you'll end up looking trashy. Always moisturise and wash your face before applying. For example, an ordinary school day: tinted foundation/powder, concealer, light powder/cream eye shadow (brown suits most eye colours), a bit of natural-looking blusher, a little brown/black mascara (after curling lashes with a quality lash curler), and clear/lightly tinted lip gloss.

, Visit www.vogue.com, or read OK! occasionally to see styles that are ""in"" at the moment. You don't have to spend hundreds of pounds/dollars to look fashionable though. Get your clothes, don't buy ""outfits"", buy pieces you can mix and match to see what looks great! Buy new clothes that fit you perfectly. Don't forget, the number on the label is just that; a number. You can always cut the label out. As long as you are healthy and fit, they don't matter. However, this doesn't mean you should get stressed out with the latest fashions all the time. Try being a trend-setter, instead of a trend-follower!

, An unfriendly person becomes instantly ugly, even if they're pretty on the outside. Be yourself and treat people well, also study and pay attention in class and watch documentaries, watch the news, and read non-fiction books and newspapers so you can hold intelligent conversation. A pretty person becomes prettier when she is clever and nice!

Visit your doctor.,
Use an over-the-counter painkiller to manage mild pain.,
Get moderate opioid painkillers to address moderate pain.If Acetaminophen and NSAIDs don't effectively manage your pain, you may ask your doctor for a prescription to receive stronger painkillers.,
Talk to your doctor about getting Morphine treatment for severe pain.Your doctor will give you a moderate painkiller first, then gradually move you to stronger or higher doses according to your pain state as well as your response to the medication.,
Adhere to the therapy plan written by your doctor.,
Take antidepressants to reduce neuropathic pain (pain caused by damage to nerve tissue).Antidepressants have a positive effect in controlling the burning or prickling sensation caused by neuropathic pain.,
Get a prescription for an anti-convulsant.,
Use local anesthetics to treat specific pain sites.,
Treat the cancer itself.It is important to remember that undergoing treatments such as surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy to shrink the size of your tumor will in itself decrease your pain.",How to Control Cancer Pain1," Let your doctor know of any pain that you are currently experiencing. They may be able to prescribe a medication or recommend a pain killer. Furthermore, they will inform you about any medications that might interfere with your current treatment.
, You can easily buy over-the-counter medicines to manage your daily pain.These OTC medications include Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as well as NSAIDs, a popular class of anti-inflammatory drugs that help block the pain receptors in your brain from receiving pain signals.


NSAIDs are usually recommended for bone or muscle pain, because they reduce the inflammation and swelling that can put pressure on the affected body part.NSAIDs are available in tablets, injections, liquids, suppositories, and topical creams.
NSAIDs include Ibuprofen (Advil) and Sodium Naproxen (Aleve).
Do not take NSAIDs if you suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder, peptic ulcers, or are taking blood thinners unless directed to do so by your doctor.

, Opioid painkillers such as Codeine and Tramadol can help to manage moderate pain, but something stronger like Morphine may be necessary for severe pain. Your oncologist is the only person who can determine what medicine is suitable to manage your pain, so don't try to self-prescribe.


Note that opioid pain medications often cause constipation as a side effect. Therefore, if your doctor begins you on these medications, he or she will likely also put you on an appropriate bowel regimen as well.It is easier to prevent bowel problems by treating them before they arise, rather than waiting until after the fact.

, Note that you will need to be monitored when using Morphine, because it has the potential for side effects.


Morphine is available in many dosage forms, such as:

Sustained release tablets, to be taken once or twice daily.
Immediate release tablets or liquid, to be taken every 2 to 4 hours.
Injections to be given directly or through a drip in a hospital.
Subcutaneous injections.
Dissolved tablets under the tongue.
Patches stuck directly to the skin.


Morphine can cause constipation, dry mouth, and itching or blurred vision.

, It is very important that you take all your medications as instructed by your doctor, even if you don't feel like you need them immediately. This is because skipping any of your doses can result in a sudden worsening of pain. Pain is best treated by getting to a level where you can prevent it before it becomes overwhelming.If you felt pain before your next scheduled dose of medication, ask your doctor to increase your dose or to change the dosage form you’re taking.
If you have sudden breakthrough pain, take a breakthrough painkiller pill (your doctor will instruct you which ones to take in such situations).

, These medications can also be useful in treating the depression that may accompany your fight against cancer.


Examples of antidepressants include Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Sertraline (Lustral). Side effects can include dry mouth or drowsiness.

, Anti-convulsants such as Gabapentin (Neurontin) can also be used to treat nerve-related pain. This requires a prescription from your doctor., Local anesthetics can be useful in certain cases of localized pain, such as mouth ulcers. Local anesthetics are commonly found as gel formulas, such as Orabase. These gels form a protective layer on the ulcer that insulates it from painful sensations.


Getting an epidural anesthetic can treat severe back pain by directly injecting medication into your spine.

, For instance, many people who have incurable cancer (such as men with prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bones) continue to receive treatment (in this case, that shrinks the size of their bone metastases). This, in turn, decreases the amount of pain they feel (in this case, it reduces bone pain).


It can wind up being one of the most effective strategies of pain management, even though the treatment itself is aimed at the symptoms rather than being aimed at actually curing the cancer.

Notice vision problems.,
Pay attention to oral symptoms.,
Identify muscle weaknesses.,
Recognize nausea like symptoms.",How to Recognize Botulism Symptoms1," Botulism can often cause a variety of issues with your vision. For example, blurred vision or double vision are common symptoms of botulism. You may also experience drooping eyelids.If you notice other symptoms it is a good idea to look in the mirror to see if your eyelids are drooping.;
, Many people who are suffering from botulism experience an extremely dry mouth. They will also have difficulty swallowing or speaking, often as a result of dry mouth., Facial weakness, on both sides of the face, is a common symptom of both wound based and foodborne botulism. For instance, you may notice drooping eyelids, the corners of your mouth may droop, and you may have difficulty using your facial muscles. Severe muscle weakness, including paralysis, can also be a sign of botulism.Keep in mind that neurological deficits are usually symmetrical. If you have a unilateral facial droop (a droop on one side of your face), then that is more in line with something like a Stroke or Bell’s Palsy.

, Foodborne botulism is often accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. This is because the toxin has been ingested and often manifests itself in symptoms related to the gastrointestinal system."

Treat noncardiac medical conditions that cause palpitations.,
Meet with your doctor if you are experiencing palpitations caused by cardiac conditions.,
Follow your doctor’s orders.",How to Manage Palpitations2," Some conditions that are not related to the heart (noncardiac) can cause heart palpitations. If you think you may have a condition that is causing your palpitations, it is important to talk to your doctor about what you can do to treat the condition. Noncardiac conditions that can lead to palpitations include:


Anemia.
Anxiety.
Beta-blocker withdrawal.
Pregnancy.
Hypoglycemia.
Mastocytosis.
Some medications.

, Cardiac conditions are conditions that involve your heart. Your doctor will create a prescribed plan for you to follow to treat or manage these conditions.


The next step will describe some of the recommendations or requirements your doctor may prescribe for you so that you can keep your palpitations to a minimum.

, As mentioned above, if you have a cardiac condition that can cause palpitations, you will have to create a management plan with your doctor. This management plan may involve things like:


Avoid substances and drugs that cause palpitations, like caffeine, alcohol or cocaine.
If you have tachycardia, your doctor may advise you to take rate controlling drugs like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
Your doctor may advise you to take anti-arrhythmic medications to control arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and to prevent their occurrence in future.
Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may advise you to use ‘Pill in the pocket strategy’. This means that he or she may prescribe you drugs that are supposed to be kept in your pocket always, and taken once you feel palpitations.
Some arrhythmias are due to structural problems in the electrical pathways of heart (called accessory pathways). In such cases, your doctor may advise you to get these structural problems corrected by advanced medical techniques like catheter ablation.

Instant hair thickeners are becoming widely available.,
Consider hair transplants.",How to Get Thick Hair3," There are products made for both men and women that are found to be effective by many people.


Some of the products are hair growth-stimulating shampoos, and others have a more complicated application process that requires you to sit with the product on your head and allow it to work. Do some research to figure out which is right for your needs.
Test the product on one discreet part of your head before applying it to your entire scalp, since you may have an allergy.

, Extensions are attached to your existing strands of hair in such a way that they blend in with your natural texture and color. They can be as long or short as you want.


Extensions can be expensive, so conduct some research before you choose what type to get.
Visit a stylist to ask for information about extensions and have them placed in your hair.

, Coloured sprays and creams can be used to colour the scalp and give the appearance of thicker hair. Another option is Nanogen, tiny keratin fibres which bind to your hair making it thicker, but wash off easily. These are a more flexible solution that transplants.

, Commonly called hair plugs, hair transplants are surgically inserted in spots where hair is balding or thinning.


This method is usually pursued by men, but women with thinning hair may also get hair transplants.
Hair transplants are done in a doctor's office. Consult your doctor or ask for a referral to get further information about whether you are a good candidate for this procedure.

Be firm.",How to Turn Down a Second Date," One way to let a person down easy is to lead into the rejection by telling them something positive. That way, they hear something good about themselves before they realize you're saying you don't want a second date.For example, you could say, ""You're fun to be around,"" or ""You have a great sense of humor."";
, When you do offer a reason for rejecting the person, keep it focused on you or the feelings between the two of you. That way, you're not actually rejecting the person. Rather, you're saying that you two just aren't a good mix together.For example, you could say, ""I don't think we had much chemistry,"" or ""My feelings for you are purely platonic.""

, Once you've said you don't want another date, you can move on to wishing the person well in some form. You'll be starting on a high note, moving to a more negative note (rejection), and then ending on a high note.For instance, you could say, ""I wish you the best,"" ""I hope you find someone that makes you happy.""

, Even if you've been on a date with someone, you don't have to offer a reason why you don't want to go on a second date. The key is to be polite and to the point. You don't want to draw it out if you're saying no this way.If someone asks you on a second date, you can simply say, ""No, but I appreciate you asking me.""

, One way to help you figure out what to say is think about what you'd want to hear. For instance, most people would rather be told outright than just ignored for the next few days or weeks., You don't want to lead the person on, so you need to make sure you say ""no"" in some form; however, you don't need to be mean about it. Don't attack the person, but rather, bring up what you did like about them.Avoid saying things like ""maybe"" or ""I don't think so"" or anything that suggests you might change your mind or could be persuaded to go out with them again.
Remember the compliment sandwich: Start with a positive, tell them you're not interested, then end on a positive note. Something like: ""You're a great person, but I don't feel a romantic connection with you. I know you'll be really happy with the right person.""

, While it may seem easier and maybe even kinder in the moment to fib about why you don't want to go on a second date, making something up has the potential to seriously backfire. You may also be tempted to ghost the person — never contact them again and stop responding to their texts and calls, but this is unfair and can be more hurtful than just telling the person you're not interested.


Saying ""no"" should be enough without having to make up an excuse.
Don't say ""yes"" and then pretend you're busy whenever the person calls you, or promise yo call and follow up and then ignore them.
If you make up an excuse, it's very possible you might get caught in your lie. Pretending to be sick, that you're getting serious with someone else, that you have to work, etc. — all of these excuses may seem appealing, but the other person could easily find out that you are lying, especially if you have mutual friends.

, Email and texting are convenient and might make it a little easier to turn someone down since they are not right there in front of you, but it's also very difficult to convey your tone. It can be very easy for the other person to misinterpret what you are saying if they can't hear your voice or see your face and body language.


If the question comes up at the end of the fist date, this is a good time to tell them in person. Or if they ask you face-to-face for a second date. You don't necessarily have to set up a special time to meet up just to tell them ""no.""
If the person texts or emails you about a second date, you might write back, ""Can I call you?"" and let them down over the phone.

, If you're worried you can't say ""no"" to a second date, you may need to do some work on being more assertive. This doesn't mean being aggressive or nasty — it means you can comfortably state your opinion and how you feel while being respectful of the other person. Remember that it's okay to say ""no"" — it's your right to turn someone down and you don't need to apologize or even explain yourself. This can be very difficult for some people to do, because they worry this means they are not nice or they are afraid of confrontation. Working on becoming more assertive can help you see that it's okay to say ""No thanks.""


Remember that being assertive is a skill and that you can develop it with practice.
Try developing a mantra to combat guilt. If you find yourself thinking ""I'm a jerk because this person really likes me and I'm going to hurt their feelings,"" say instead, ""I deserve to go out with someone I like, and they deserve to go out with someone who likes them. I'm not going to waste their time and lead them on."", One way to keep the focus off the rejection is to focus on what you're thinking or feeling rather than using ""you."" If you use you-statements, the person you're talking to tends to feel like they are being blamed for the situation.For instance, you should say, ""I'm not feeling the chemistry between us,"" instead of, ""You're not right for me.""

, You don't want to come across as condescending or mean. Try to keep your tone as polite and even as possible. If you start raising your voice or using sarcasm, you're only going to hurt the person more., Just like tone, your body language can give a lot away. Of course, you can't completely control your body language, but make sure you aren't smirking and try to look the person in the eye as you tell them. Try to make eye contact and keep your arms and legs uncrossed for a more open posture. Keep your body as relaxed as possible.

, If the person keeps pushing, make it absolutely clear that you don't want a second date. You may need to say it more loudly, block their number if they're trying to call, or block them on social media if they keep trying to contact you. Remember that your safety is the most important thing, and if someone is making you feel threatened, it's more important to protect yourself than try to be polite or tactful.


You could say ""I may not have made this clear in my last message, but I am not interested in a second date. Don't contact me again.""
If you find that someone is making you feel unsafe, talk to security or call the police.
If someone is coming by your house when you've asked them not to, definitely call the police.

Re-energize.",How to Be Determined," Being determined doesn't just happen out of nowhere. It comes from a strength of character that you build to succeed in the manner that you want to do succeed. Remember that one person's idea of success is going to be incredibly different than another person's.Start with your fundamentals. Decide what exactly it means to succeed. Is success about getting a psychology degree and becoming a child psychologist? Is success about getting married and having ten children?
Ask yourself questions like: what do you daydream about? how do you want people to see you? how would you like to make an impact in the world? what would you want to leave behind (troubles, attributes, people, etc.)? Questions like these will help you figure out more clearly what success means to you and what determination will help you gain.Consider what would make you happy rather than what would make your parents happy, or your friends happy, or society happy. If happiness for you is having a llama farm out in the middle of nowhere, then start considering how to make that a reality.;
, There are different kinds of determination, which people use at different times. Some of them are more useful than others, and some of them can be combined with others.Up hill determination is when you work to achieve a difficult task despite many or large obstacles in an effort to achieve your goals. An example of this might be a college student taking on more classes than the other students in an effort to graduate early, while simultaneously holding down a job. This type of determination trudges on through obstacles, but it can be incredibly draining and isn't something that can be sustained over long periods of time.
Coasting determination is when you're delaying short-term gratification for the success of long-term goals. This type of determination acts rather than reacts, so that you are making things happen through self-discipline and an understanding of what it is you want. And example of this type of determination in action would be someone who is saving money for a big trip. Instead of going out to dinner (short-term gratification) they save the money for the big trip (success of long-term goals).
Both of these types of determination are good in their own ways, and they should be used in conjunction with one another. There are times when you will need to employ the uphill determination rather than the coasting determination, because there is an immediate obstacle that you need to work through.

, Once you know what success means to you, you will need to come up with goals that will help you achieve that success. It's best to have a combination of big goals and small goals so that you are constantly accomplishing things, which will bolster your determination to keep going.


This will also help you take your goals step by step. If you focus too much on the overall picture (the big goal, or the achieving success) you'll probably start to feel overwhelmed which will make your determination harder to maintain.
For example: If you define success as publishing a novel, your goals will include writing the book itself, editing it, learning about the publishing industry, figuring out which literary agents to send it to, writing a synopsis and cover letter, and sending it off to the different agents and publishers.

, Once you have the goals that you want to achieve, then it's time to develop the specific ways you're going to achieve those goals. The more specific your plans and strategies, the easier it will be to be determined when you have actionable steps to keep you motivated.Create a timeline for your goals. Mark them down on your calendar to keep you on track. Make a list of the long-term ""big"" goals and the shorter-term smaller goals that will help you achieve the bigger ones.
Remain flexible with your goals and your timeline. Don't beat yourself up if you end up needing more time to complete something, or if you decide that a goal you had is actually not that important to you.

Make a plan to deal with temptations. Things will happen that will make it so you'll want to give up, or you'll want to give yourself a break. Have a plan to deal with the temptations so you don't end up giving in to immediate gratification. For example: for the person who is planning the big trip, they might keep a reminder of the trip with them so that when they are tempted by eating out, they remember what they're saving for. Also, they could make meal plans so that they don't end up on a situation where it's simply easier to eat out.

, It's hard to accomplishing things, even when you're determined, if you don't have a clear idea of what you're accomplishing and what is outside of that limit. This doesn't mean that you restrict yourself, because you don't want to limit yourself too much, but being clear about your boundaries will make accomplishing things much easier.


For example: instead of saying I'm going to work on my novel every day, set aside a specific time. Say, ""I'm going to write from 6:00 am to 8:00 am every morning."" There are no vague boundaries with this, you have set very specific parameters, which makes it easier to follow.

, Often, when you get feedback or work on improving yourself, you focus on the things that need to be improved. Don't ignore those things, but figure out your strengths and use those to help you succeed and use your determination to achieve your goals.Have friends/coworkers/family/teachers give you examples of times when you excelled (when you used your strengths). Locate common themes throughout the examples and create a picture of your strong suits.
For example: if people choose examples of times when you were incredibly honest, or worked really hard, or came up with creative solutions to problems, then use those to craft the image of yourself based on those strengths.

, One important habit to learn and to cultivate is being flexible. This doesn't mean folding your body up into a pretzel, but it does mean being able to deal with life when it throws you a curve-ball. When you're too caught up in making exactly what you think should happen, happen, you forget to pay attention to the surprising opportunities.


Check in with your goals and strategies. Don't just assume that something that seemed important when you were 24 is going to be important to you when you're 34. People change and grow and you have to make sure that your priorities and goals are changing to reflect that. Don't keep doing something because you think you have to do it. If it isn't helping you to succeed, then scrap it.

Try something new. Getting outside of your comfort zone helps keep you flexible and prepares you for dealing with the unexpected. It's also a good way to practice your determination. For example: if you've never really experienced the outdoors, you might try out hiking, starting small and working your way up to climbing a whole mountain, or doing overnight hiking.
Change up your regular routine. A good way to keep yourself from getting into a rut and then not being able to handle surprises in life. One day instead of driving home, take the bus, or ride your bike. Do something spontaneous after work, or go to a different coffee shop than you usually use.

, This is a hugely important part of being determined and achieving your goals. Negative thinking will keep you mired in negativity, which in turn makes the obstacles and curve-balls of life far more difficult to deal with. Positivity, on the other hand, allows you to persevere.


Pay attention to your negative thought patterns. Learn to identify the negative language you use on yourself and situations. For example: if you find yourself thinking ""I'm so weak I can't even do one push-up,"" change that thought. Instead think, ""My goal is to be super strong and to that end I'm working on doing push-ups.""
Use the list of positive qualities your community help you to create in the previous section. When you start in thinking negatively about yourself, stop and consider the list that they made.
You, just like everyone else, have areas that you need to work on. Maybe you're a less than effective communicator or you have a bad temper. Acknowledging that there's room for improvement is great! The problem comes from focusing exclusively on those traits and seeing yourself as determined only by those traits.

, Confidence is the ability to believe in yourself, no matter how bad things are looking. Self-confident people experience a hurdle and believe that they can overcome it. This, in a nutshell, is determination. Determination is seeing a roadblock and believing that you can get past it, not necessarily because you have evidence that you've done so in the past, but because you can't picture yourself not getting past it.Practice confidence until you actually start to feel confident. Walk tall, stand in a power pose and act like you take up space and that you matter (because you do matter). The more you practice acting like you matter, the more you'll trick your brain into believing that you do.

Don't compare yourself to other people. You might feel like you aren't as determined as your older sister, or you aren't accomplishing as much as your best friend. Ask yourself whether what they are doing is important to you. The things you are accomplishing are going to be different than what your friend is accomplishing. You have different goals in life and different definitions of success. Don't limit yourself by comparing your accomplishments to other people.

, You'll need to make sure that goals you're setting for yourself and the timeline you're setting is actually achievable. This is why it's important to keep your goal load manageable, but still challenging enough that you have to maintain your determination.Pick your battles. Don't try to force your way through every single obstacle and goal. When you hit a really big obstacle, it's good to stop and consider what's the point for going ahead.
For example: say you feel you really want to go into space as an astronaut, but you end up with a debilitating disease which makes it impossible to pass the physical tests. You would have to reconsider how to follow your passion in a new way (possibly by becoming an astrophysicist, or helping to design space ships, or even finding a way for someone with your limitations to go into space).
An example of a situation where you're being too hard on yourself might be: one of your goals is to excel in college, so you decide to take on the hardest classes you can take, and to tutor other students as well, while simultaneously trying to work, as well. At some point, you'll need to give yourself a break, either by dropping the tutoring gig or taking a least one, less difficult course.

, Keeping your determination going can be greatly bolstered by making healthy life choices. It can be much easier to function when you're body is being sustained by good fuel, enough sleep, and a good amount of exercise. All these things can help deal with things like depression and anxiety that can make it much harder to be determined.



Sleep is a big factor in mental health and abilities. try to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, with as many of those hours before midnight as possible. To help your body get into sleep mode more quickly, turn off your electronic devices (like computer, phone, iPod) at least 30 minutes before you go to bed.

Make healthy food choices. Eat lots of veggies and fruits (especially the dark green and colorful ones, which have more nutrients). Avoid eating lots of sugars and salty or processed foods, which can make you feel sluggish or depressed. Go for good carbohydrates like brown rice, oatmeal, and sprouted wheat. Definitely get enough protein (like eggs, fish, lean meats, etc.).

Exercise for 30 minutes every day. Exercising releases good chemicals like endorphins which can give you more energy and make you feel happier. Exercise can be anything from putting on a music playlist and having a dance party, to going for a long run.

, People who are determined and use that determination are people who don't call things ""failures."" Obstacles and learning experiences will crop up in your path no matter how prepared you are. In most cases, obstacles and ""failures"" are actually opportunities (as clichéd as this sounds).


Re-frame the problem. One good way to do this is to consider the ""why."" For example, if you're asked to build a bridge across a river and you ask why you need to build a bridge. The answer might be ""because you have to get to the other side."" But, of course, there are different ways to get across the river (a ferry system, a tunnel, fly a hot air balloon, etc.). Considering why a bridge, can open you up to further possibilities (why do you need to cross the river? what kind of materials are available, etc.). Asking these questions will open up a realm of possibilities.
Ask yourself what you've learned from a supposed ""failure."" What would you do differently next time? What factors combined to cause the ""failure"" to happen? Was failing really as bad as you feared?

Fear of failure is one of the main things that stops people from gaining their goals, however determined they think they are. Seeing ""failure"" as a learning opportunity instead makes you less likely to fear it happening, which in turn makes it easier to accomplish your goals.

, Thinking outside the box will greatly help you stay on track and accomplish your goals. This is especially important when you do hit an obstacle, because creative solutions can often provide you with an avenue that you might not otherwise have considered.



Daydreaming is actually an incredibly useful tool. When you're confronted with a problem, taking some time to daydream and let your mind free to consider the problem without restrictions. A good time to practice a little daydreaming is right before you go to bed at night, but you can do it any time.
Asking yourself some questions to open up your creative problem-solving: if you have any resources in the world, how would you approach the problem? If there were no possibility of failure, what would you try? If you didn't have to worry about budget, what resources would you use? If you could ask anyone for help, who would you ask?

, Although it sounds a bit weird, visualization is actually a really powerful technique for boosting your determination. Practice visualizing yourself accomplishing the goals that you are working towards accomplishing. The more clearly you visualize this (with sound, smells, and specific details) the more likely you are to actually accomplish them.


try to meditate every day. This helps to calm your mind and makes it easier for you to stay focused on the things you've chosen as important. try to meditate for at least 15 minutes each day (or choose a specific number of breaths to meditate for, so you aren't constantly checking the clock).

, When you forget why you're doing something, it becomes that much harder to keep on doing it. If you lose sight of the things that are important to you, you'll be less likely to accomplish them.When you're confronted by temptation ask yourself ""what do I lose if I give in to this?"" For example: if you're tempted by spending money on eating out instead of saving it for your big trip, remind yourself what you'll lose (i.e. it'll take more time to collect the money to go on your trip, or you won't be able to go as many places, because you won't have as much money to use).
Think long term. Envision the future and your life pathways opening up as a result of your hard work and determination now. Realise that being resilient now will be good practice for the future.

, Sometimes you really and truly need to take a break to get your energy back into the game. There's nothing wrong with that! Taking a break doesn't mean that you aren't determined, it simply means that you're getting yourself rested for continuing to work hard towards your goals.


Take a break. This can be a big break, like taking a vacation, or it can be a small thing like taking the afternoon off and going out for coffee or going book shopping.
Do something you love. Make sure that you reward yourself for accomplishing things and being determined. This will make you more likely to succeed.

Practice good hygiene.",How to Treat Hepatitis A," Symptoms of hepatitis A are often described as flu-like and include fatigue (tiredness), weakness, loss of appetite and a low-grade fever.To combat these symptoms, get plenty of rest, especially during the initial stages of the infection, and temporarily reduce your activities and exercise regiment.


You'll probably need to stay home from work or school until the flu-like symptoms fade away (a few weeks of so).
Focus on getting at least 8 hours of quality sleep each night, if not more.
Take a break from the gym for a few weeks until your energy levels build back up. Instead, go for a short walk on occasion to get some fresh air and stimulate your blood circulation.;
, Other symptoms associated with hepatitis A are abdominal pain or discomfort near your liver (upper right side beneath your ribs) and joint pain, especially large joints such as your hips, spine and knees.Over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help reduce painful symptoms, but keep your dosage well below maximum recommended amounts.


The liver is responsible for processing (metabolizing) drugs in your body, so higher doses can irritate, inflame and damage liver cells, especially if they're already infected with viral hepatitis.
Adults tend to experience more symptoms than children because their liver cells don't grow and regenerate as quickly.
Ibuprofen is not appropriate for young children, so stick with small doses of acetaminophen if you need to reduce symptoms.

, Another common symptom of hepatitis is mild-to-moderate nausea and potential vomiting, which can wax and wane throughout the day.To combat nausea, eat smaller meals or snacks throughout the day instead of three large ones. Focus on bland food, such as crackers, bread and white rice. Avoid fatty and fried foods, as well as spicy seasonings.


Ginger is a natural remedy for nausea, so consider taking ginger capsules, eating pickled ginger or drinking real ginger ale.
If your nausea and/or vomiting is severe, your doctor may prescribe an antiemetic drug (such as metoclopramide) to reduce the symptoms.

, A further complication of chronic or severe bouts of vomiting is dehydration, especially if you can't keep fluids down. Symptoms of dehydration to look out for include: severe thirst, dry skin, sunken looking eyes, lack of urination, headache, confusion and lethargy (fatigue).Focus on drinking purified water and herbal teas for hydration, although chicken / beef broths and diluted fruit juices are also good sources of electrolytes (mineral salts that are lost with vomiting).


Avoid beverages with caffeine (coffee, black tea, colas, energy drinks) because it's a diuretic that stimulates urination and increases the risk of dehydration.
If you can't keep yourself hydrated with beverages, you'll need to go to a hospital or emergency clinic to get intravenous fluid through a vein in your arm.

, Another potential side effect with any form of hepatitis or liver disease is a general sense of itchiness (also called pruritis) all over the body.Liver-related itchiness is caused by two main factors: an accumulation of toxins that haven't been filtered out by a damaged liver, and a back-up of bilirubin in the blood.


To combat itchiness wear loose clothing, avoid hot baths and showers, don't get sunburned and maintain a cool, well-ventilated environment in your home.No amount of scratching relieves this form of pruritis, so don't start and then risk getting a skin infection.
A build-up of bilirubin levels due to a damaged liver also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes).
With severe cases of itching, taking an over-the-counter antihistamine medication may help because it reduces inflammatory reactions.

, An injured and inflamed liver has trouble processing and metabolizing (breaking down) the toxins in medications, as well as alcohol (ethanol).As such, take it easy on your liver by not drinking alcoholic beverages while your body fights the hepatitis A virus — it may take a few weeks to a few months, depending on the severity of the infection and strength of your immune system.


Although red wine has some health value (it contains antioxidants), it should also be avoided by people with hepatitis.
Instead of wine, drink grape juice with meals as long as it doesn't trigger nausea.
Instead of drinking regular beer after work or on weekends, try non-alcoholic varieties.

, The easiest way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated with the hepatitis A vaccine.It's proven to be effective at preventing infection by the virus. Hepatitis A vaccines are typically given in two doses — an initial shot in the arm followed by a booster shot about six months later. All children by the age of two years should get vaccinated to help prevent future infection.


People who are recommended to get vaccinated include: lab workers who handle hep A, people who work with sewage, men who have anal sex, illicit drug users, patients with chronic liver disease, and people traveling to areas with high rates of hep A.The effectiveness of the hep A vaccine ranges from 80-100% after 1-2 doses in most people.The three types of vaccines used against hep A are: a monovalent vaccine, a combined hep A and hep B vaccine, and a combined hep A and typhoid fever vaccine.
For adults, a booster hep A shot is estimated to protect you for at least 20 years., If you're traveling to higher risk places where hepatitis A outbreaks frequently occur, then take the necessary precautions. More specifically, peel and thoroughly wash all fresh fruits and veggies yourself before eating them.Avoid eating any raw or under-cooked meat, poultry and fish. Drink only bottled water and also use it when brushing your teeth. Don't drink any beverages with ice added.


Higher risk areas for hepatitis A include Mexico, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Asia and most parts of South America.
If bottled water isn't available to you, boil tap water for about 10 minutes before drinking it.

, In addition to contaminated food and water, hepatitis A is also transmitted from infected people — either sexually or from their dirty dirty hands.As such, practice good hygiene by frequently washing your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. As an alternative to soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after you shake hands with someone or handle fresh produce (fruits and veggies).


Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating it.The hep A virus can also be transmitted sexually, so practice safe sex and always insist on condom usage.

Test your blood sugar regularly.,
Generally, a safe level is between 80 and 120 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) before meals for people age 59 and younger with no underlying medical conditions.,
Create nutritious, well-portioned meals.,
Take your medication.,
Exercise regularly.,
Lower your cholesterol.,
Seek attention for high blood pressure.,
Request regular tests.,
Review your routine.,
Ask about proper equipment.",How to Prevent Kidney Damage with Type 1 Diabetes," Regularly checking your blood sugar is essential to making sure that your levels are appropriate and not causing any long-term harm to your body. Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding when and how often to test.If you do not already have an established testing schedule, call your doctor or make an appointment and ask, “When throughout the day should I be checking my blood sugar?” Most people with type 1 test at least four to eight times per day — more for increased activity levels, during illness, or during changes in medication.;
, Note, however, that this is a general guideline and you should refer to the parameters set by your doctor.

If you are above this range, contact your doctor to ask about testing for kidney damage or disease.
Log your levels after each reading to keep track and check for patterns or long-term complications, such as nerve damage (neuropathy), skin infections, eye damage, heart disease, and more., Protein has been shown to help regulate blood glucose levels, while carbohydrates have been shown to raise it.Try making yourself balanced meals with 20 to 30% of calories coming from lean protein and no more than about 40% carbohydrates.Integrate fiber, such as whole grains, into your carb intake at every meal.
Take the time to weigh out food to help ensure you are getting the correct portion. Check on food labels to see the recommended serving size and accompanying nutritional information.
Consult with your doctor, diabetes educator, or a registered dietitian about customizing a healthy meal plan if a standard plan isn’t helping you keep your glucose levels under control.
Take advantage of the resources available online to find healthy, diabetes-friendly recipes. Try this guide from the American Diabetes Association: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/4/734.full


, If you have been prescribed insulin or other medication by your doctor, take it exactly as recommended. These medications often have a significant impact on your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar and avoid long-term health damage.If you have not been prescribed any prescription medication by your doctor, understand that there may be a reason. Ask your doctor, “Is there any medication I should be taking to help me control my diabetes?”
Follow your doctor’s guidelines for both the amount of insulin you should use and your injection schedule.

, Exercise helps control your blood pressure level as well as your overall bodily health, both of which greatly impact your kidney function. Aim for 30 to 45 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise four to five times a week to help keep your kidneys healthy.Exercise can be anything from walking to swimming or anything else that raises your heartrate. The exercise should feel challenging, but not so much so that it inhibits proper movement or function later on.
Integrate exercise into your daily routine by making choices such as walking or biking to school or work and taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

, High LDL cholesterol can cause plaque buildup in your kidneys and blood vessels and impede their function. Get your cholesterol under control to avoid compounding any kidney damage caused by diabetes.Make heart-healthy food choices such as opting for monounsaturated fats like olive oil, eliminating trans fats, and increasing your soluble fiber intake.
Create and follow action plans to quit habits such as smoking and excessive drinking. Seek help from professionals or support groups if necessary.

, If a balanced diet and regular exercise are not helping you control a high blood pressure problem, seek attention from a medical professional. Your doctor may be able to recommend an ACE inhibitor, which may not only help regulate high blood pressure, but may also slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease.Do not take any blood pressure regulating medication or supplements without first consulting your doctor. Let them know, “I want to find something that can help me regulate my blood pressure and prevent future kidney problems. What do you recommend?”
Not all Type I diabetes patients will have high blood pressure. Check regularly or have your doctor’s office check to see if your blood pressure is under control.

, If you are worried about kidney damage, request regular kidney function tests from your doctor. In addition, have them monitor indicators of kidney damage such as blood pressure.Aim to have a urine or blood test every year to check kidney function.
Talk to your doctor about an HbA1c test, which will indicate whether or not your blood sugar has stayed within a healthy rage over the last two to three months. A high result increases your risk of complications, such as kidney damage. The results of this test can help your doctor make any necessary changes to your treatment plan.Let your doctors know if you are taking ACE inhibitors, which can impact the urine test used to check for kidney function.

, After testing, regularly review your diet, exercise, and medication routines with your doctor. Be honest with them about what you have and have not been doing so that they can get a better understanding of what is working and what may need to be modified.If you can, meet with a team of specialists to help you review your routine. Talk to dietitians and trainers that specialize in helping individuals with diabetes, along with your doctor.
Cross-communicate with your team. Let your doctor know what your dietitian recommends and vice versa.

, You may benefit from using an insulin pump or a continuous glucose monitor if you are looking to take better control of your Type I diabetes. Ask your doctor about proper blood glucose monitoring and insulin injecting equipments.These machines may or may not benefit your particular situation. Ask your doctor about the advantages and disadvantages of each before either are added to your treatment plan.

Use your school's career services office.,
Find internships and other professional work.",How to Be a Successful College Student," Don't rely on a ""magic number"" of classes you can miss and still do well. Each missed class represents missed content and missed discussion. Some professors weigh participation into your final grade calculation. Even if attendance isn't required, however, you will make a good impression on your professor and TA if you show up to class.Only miss class if you are genuinely sick—too sick to get anything worthwhile out of the lecture.
If you need some incentive, consider the cost of each class hour. The average yearly cost of tuition at a public university is $9,139.Given a 15-week semester with 4 classes each semester, you pay over $25 per class hour for the privilege of being taught. Not going to class is basically the same as setting twenty-five bucks on fire. Would you do that?;
, Your memory is never as good as you think it is. There will probably be plenty of things taking up space in your mind while at school. Taking good notes will keep you engaged in classroom activities (lectures and discussion) and give you a good basis when studying for exams.


For classes that are organized around clear, logically ordered topics, such as history or biology, the Cornell method can help you prioritize the most important information.

, Ask questions of your instructors, give answers if they ask questions, and contribute to discussion sections. Taking an active part in the class will keep you involved with the material, and help you better understand what the instructor needs you to know.Sitting in front, or at least not in the back, will make it easier to pay attention and put you front and center for the professor to see.

, Success in college relies on you preparing outside of class, so spend time reviewing your notes and reading the textbook for each session. When you study, find a quiet space and cut off outside distractions. A good rule of thumb is to spend two hours studying for each hour you spend in class.Study groups—working with other students in your class—can be helpful, but also go off-track easily. Make sure you find a study group that reviews the material, and spends most of its time actually studying, rather than chatting.
Don't cram! Part of being a successful college student is doing more than passing tests; it's retaining the useful information for the real world. When you cram, you might remember enough to pass your exam, but chances are high that you'll forget most of it in a day or two. When you're spending tens of thousands of dollars to learn this stuff, actually remembering it for later is a smart investment.Spacing out your study sessions over a few days is the best way to make sure you remember the material later.Rather than spending a 9-hour marathon studying for a test, for example, start a few days early and study for 1-2 hours each day for 3 or 4 days in a row. If you can plan well ahead of time, it's even better to space your studying out over a period of weeks., No professor ever complained about her students finishing an assignment early. Setting aside time to complete one task will give ease your stress level, and make it more likely to complete others on time.


On occasion, you may need to stay up all night to finish an assignment. Procrastinating will only make doing so more likely, and doing work early can help you get more regular sleep.
Set yourself regular performance goals, such as writing 200 words a day on your essay or studying six math problems. These small goals seem easy to do so you're less likely to procrastinate on them. However, the accomplishments will pile up fast.
Try to avoid guilting yourself into your work. Extrinsic motivation, such as ""I ought to do this so my parents don't get mad at me,"" isn't as strong as intrinsic motivation, such as ""I want to do well on that exam so that my good grades will help me get into medical school."" Setting positive goals for yourself and reminding yourself that your work will help you achieve them can help crush procrastination.

, Your professors want you to do well in class, so feel free to ask questions about the material. Every professor has open office hours, so stop by to introduce yourself, ask about the class, or discuss your grades. This can allow them to learn more about you, your strengths and weaknesses, and provide better feedback for improving your work.Don't forget about your TAs. Many of them are quite knowledgeable about the subject as well. In a large class it will likely be them, not the professor, doing most of the grading.
It's best if you can set the foundation for communication early. If the first time your professor hears from you is the night before your midterm exam halfway through the semester, she may not take you as seriously as she would have if you'd come early and often to ask questions.

, Most students' attitude towards a class dictates their success. Believe you can learn the material and be successful, and you will increase your chances of succeeding. Don't think about how difficult things are, but how you are going to overcome those difficulties.If you're naturally shy or worried about sharing your opinions in class, remind yourself that your professor wants you to learn. In general, classrooms are a ""safe space"" for people to share their opinions, ask questions, and have discussions. Try not to worry about sounding silly if you ask a question—chances are, many of your classmates have the same question but are too afraid to ask. You can be the trailblazer!

, You won't always be able to follow your passions in the classroom. Find groups and activities that you enjoy, or maybe involve practical applications for your academic work. These events are also a great way to meet new people and make friends.

, Colleges have access to a nearly unmatched variety of cultural, intellectual, and athletic events that are available to students. Take advantage of these, and take part in the cultural life of the school, some of which you may never have the opportunity to do again.

, Unlike in high school, no one will be tracking you and your activities in college, so you will have to do that yourself. Give each event and assignment a priority based on timing, and its importance to achieving your ultimate goals. Your schedule should not just be about academic work, so include time for personal activities and interests.


One thing you may discover is that your schedule is too overloaded between class, work, social events, and other activities. Organizing your schedule can sometimes mean knowing when to cut things out.

, Studies suggest that being a freshman is incredibly stressful. It can do a number on your mental health.One of the best ways to make sure you're successful in college is to make friends with a variety of diverse people—and to commit to hanging out with them.


Making a strong social network in college is also linked to better work performance later in life.
This doesn't mean you should spend every night partying and ditching class and homework. Instead, strive for a healthy balance. You can even get your friends involved in class and other school activities, such as a sport or debate team.

, At many colleges and universities, Greek life—a system of fraternities and sororities students can join—is a major part of student experience. While being part of Greek life can have many benefits, such as socialization and support networks, it can also involve a significant time commitment. This can be particularly stressful your freshman year, when you are already adjusting to many new experiences. Some experts recommend that you wait until your sophomore year to ""rush"" or join a fraternity or sorority. That way, you'll already have a firm academic foundation., Pick courses that interest you, and make you excited to learn. This will lead you to interesting and rewarding work, rather than simply chasing easy classes.Avoid picking a major right away. Unless you are completely sure that you want to go into a particular field, there is no benefit to declaring right away. Sample classes in a variety of fields, and learn what kind of work each major requires., You want to graduate on time, so make sure you have fulfilled all requirements for the school and your major. You will need to have enough credit hours, and high enough grades. Keep an eye out for non-academic items like physical fitness requirements.


Most colleges and universities have a ""degree progress"" calculator you can find online, but if not, talk with your adviser.

, College should be difficult, and you should be prepared to deal with failure, or at least not succeeding as much as you did in high school. Your life after college will not be about the grades you got in school, but the ways you learned to deal with disappointment., Every school has one. Find out what kinds of work graduates from your school and your major go into. These places can also provide help with creating a resume, filling out job applications, and other helpful hints for what comes next., If possible, find something that will let you apply what you are learning in a work environment. You can gain valuable professional experience for afterwards.

Conquer continents wisely.,
Pay attention to the army bonus that you get for each continent.,
Attack with the right amount of armies.,
Determine how many armies to keep on each territory.",How to Win at the Game Risk1," While it is good to try to conquer continents early in the game, you should be careful about which continents you decide to conquer. There are advantages and disadvantages to each continent, but the main thing to consider is the isolation of a continent. More isolated continents may be easier to maintain, but they are also more difficult to expand from. Therefore, you should choose a continent that is in line with your strategy.For example, Australia is easy to conquer and maintain because of how isolated it is, but it is also hard to expand from Australia and you may fall prey to more powerful plays later in the game. For these reasons, conquering Australia may offer you an advantage, but only if you feel capable of overcoming its disadvantage.;
, Some continents are much more beneficial to hold than others because you will get a better army bonus each turn. Before you begin trying to conquer a continent, find out how many armies you will get as a bonus for holding that continent. For example, Europe gives you a bonus of 5 armies per turn for holding the continent, while Africa gives you a bonus of 3 armies per turn.Keep in mind that Europe and North America are the most beneficial continents to hold because they give you the best army bonuses. Try to hold one of these continents if you can.

, Knowing how many armies to use in an attack on an opponent can be a big boost to your chances of winning. A good general rule in attacking an enemy territory is to use twice as many armies as your opponent has on the territory you want to attack. This will increase your chances of winning and overtaking the territory. Keep in mind that you will need to move these armies to an adjacent territory before you begin your attack.For example, if an opponent has two armies on a territory that you want, then you should attack that territory with at least four armies.

, In most cases, you will benefit from having most of your armies on your border territories. Concentrating your armies in this way helps to reduce the chances that you will have a weak spot and be overtaken by an opponent. The territories within your borders can have fewer armies, but try to avoid having a single weak spot that an opponent may try to target."

However, creating one can be difficult if you have never had a job before. You will need to look at your soft skills, experiences and background to help you develop a strong resume despite these deficiencies. Also, check out creating a resume when you have no experience.


Make sure you don’t use distracting formats in your resume. Avoid fancy fonts and colors. Don’t make your resume too long—work toward it being about the length of one page.
Showcase your skills and background. The hiring manager wants to know about your potential to be successful with them. Since you don’t have a lot of work experience, focus on things like your ability to meet deadlines, your customer service skills, professionalism, organization skills, teams and projects you have worked on successfully, fundraising work, hobbies, contests or competitions you have won. Don’t forget school grades.;
, When you don’t have a lot of experience, your cover letter is one of the best tools you have to convince a hiring manager that they should interview you. Customize each cover letter to fit the requirements of the job position you want. Explain why you want the job and why you will excel at the position.If the job position calls for an organized administration assistant and you regularly organize everything on your desk at home in alphabetical order alongside a labeled file folder for finished work from each one of your classes, then go ahead and use this “hobby” as a selling point.

, No job means no money. No money means you'll be crawling back to your parents for a place to stay and a meal in your stomach. Understand that you may not get the first job you apply to but if you keep trying, you are bound to get something.


If you are serious about living on your own, you need to be serious at looking for a job. Check local listings as well as online sites such as Monster.com, Linkedin or Indeed.com. Go in and drop off your resume. Fill out applications at places with open positions as well as those you’d like to work at. Do it every day of the week until you are offered a position.
Call your contacts. Your friends, family members, neighbors, teachers and others may know someone hiring. Networking this way and letting everyone know you are in the market for a job can be a beneficial way to “get your foot in the door” somewhere.
Look for a job doing something you're good at or that you can prove you’d be good at. You don’t need to be a perfect match for the position but if you know you can take phone calls and talk to people, then a customer service job at a call center may be a good fit.

, After you submit a resume or fill out an application, you may want to increase your chances of getting a position by calling the company directly. Introduce yourself to a supervisor or hiring manager and let them know you submitted an application for the position. Connecting this way can make your application stand out when review time comes., The interview is an opportunity for you to convince the hiring manager that you have what it takes to do the job better than all the other applicants. You want to use your winning personality to help you get the job position. Remember, your goal is always to get an offer.


Why do you think you’d be great at this job? If you don’t have experience, think of personal traits you can bring to the job. Have stories of past experiences that demonstrate you can be successful, particularly with this job position.
Be both confident and show humility. You need to convince them you can do the job but that you’re willing to learn as well. Know your strengths and weaknesses but always paint weakness in a positive light. For example, maybe you used to be shy but now you understand the importance of making connections with people and make an effort to greet strangers, make new friends and be an engaged communicator., Making money allows you to live on your own, teaches you valuable new skillsets, shows you what you will and will not enjoy doing long-term and provides valuable references. So do whatever it takes to earn money today. Don’t wait for that perfect job before making money. The job you get today does not have to be the job you’re doing years later.Wait tables at night, clean houses, deliver pizza or newspapers early in the morning so you can look for a job during day hours.
Start your own service doing jobs during your off hours. You can choose to do yardwork, wash cars, walk dogs, chores or babysitting. The goal is to do these things regularly enough to earn enough money to support yourself.
Consider non-traditional jobs like trying out for roles in commercials, movies, theater, radio and TV. Actors and performers are usually paid well and can make royalties.
Check out temporary jobs. Temporary employment firms often hire individuals to do jobs in many fields on a temporary basis. You will be told how long the position will need you so you can get an idea when to start looking for jobs again. Doing temporary work gives you an opportunity to earn skills and make connections.

, Do what it takes to get a job so you can take care of yourself. Job seeking can be stressful but you need to keep at it to be successful. Be confident that you can succeed at the positions you apply to.


When you don’t have a lot of work experience, job searching can be frustrating as well for other reasons. Recognize that you may be limited in some ways but that you have a lot to offer in other areas. Focus on what you have to offer.
If a lack of experience is continually coming back to haunt you in your job search, you should think about ways to earn that experience. Examples might be part-time internships or volunteering. It can be a bummer to work for free for a while before you move out but everyone has to start somewhere.

, If you’re having a hard time getting a job or you know what job you want to get and it requires a degree, then college is probably your best bet. It takes time and effort to get your degree or certificate but the end result will likely mean you are much more satisfied in the workforce than you would be without that education. Take a look at inexpensive, local colleges to see what programs are offered.


Many colleges have dorms that can help you learn to live on your own. Meals are often provided as well. If you or your family can’t afford college housing, financial aid can often cover some or all of it. Speak to your local college about your possibilities.
Colleges also often offer work-study opportunities. These part-time jobs can give you the experience and references you need to get into higher level positions when you graduate. Work study is usually part of your financial aid package. Ask your financial aid department for details.

, The military and programs like AmeriCorps provide training, support and guidance for young people on how to live on your own. They can offer pathways for you to enter the workforce when you finish your term. Speak to your local recruiter for the branches you want to consider or check out nationalservice.gov for public service opportunities., Sharing housing costs is a good way to save money and start living on your own. Ask around and see if someone wants to split rent and utilities with you. You might even decide to get several roommates to divide the housing costs further.


Friends and family are the best resources when looking for roommates. You can also try sites like craigslist.org but be sure to check out each potential roommate’s references and do background checks before moving in with anyone you don’t know.
Some apartments might be willing to provide two separate leases for each roommate so that you each pay the apartment complex directly.
Some areas are less expensive than others. If you can find housing within your budget, then you may not need a roommate.

, If you found a roommate who already has a place to stay, skip this step. Otherwise, venture out with your roommate and find some good deals on houses/apartments. You will likely both need to sign a lease or rental agreement.


Call up the apartment complexes in your city and start asking questions. How much is rent? What utilities are included? Does the place come fully furnished? These questions give you important information that can ultimately lead to making a decision.
Be aware that many apartments charge an application fee (usually $25-50) as well as require a security deposit and/or first and last month's rent. You may also be responsible for renter's insurance. Be sure you have enough saved up to cover these extra costs.
Pay the required fees and sign the lease--a 12 month lease is standard but some apartments may offer 6 month or even month-to-month options, which can be good if you want to try out a certain location or roommate.
When you have decided on an apartment, take pictures of the exterior and interior before moving in so you have proof that any damage existed before you got there. Keep the images along with the date they were taken somewhere safe in case you ever need them.
Make sure you understand the rules at your new apartment--not following them can get you into trouble. Are pets allowed? If so, is there a pet deposit required?

, If you have a roommate, decide how household chores will be split up between you and your roommate. Decide how you and your roommate will split expenses. Simple decisions like these, if dealt with early on, can save a lot of trouble as time goes by.


Establish ground rules. Discuss things like noise, chores, utility fees, smoking, guests and consequences of not following the rules. You may want to both sign a roommate agreement so that you are on the same page, understand what is expected of you and can avoid conflict later.

, If utilities are not included in your lease or rental agreement, call the utility companies and have them set up the utilities that you need. You will need to find out what companies manage the water, gas, electricity, trash, phone and internet services in your area and contact them to see how to get set up. You might need a copy of your lease, so be sure to have it handy.


Bundle your services. Phone and internet companies often have deals where you can pay for multiple services at a discount.
Because you are now paying for your utilities, you’ll want to be as energy efficient as possible. Buy energy efficient lightbulbs and turn off the lights whenever possible. Don’t stay up as late as you used to. Keep blankets handy for when it gets cold rather than relying on your heater.

, You will need to calculate all of your expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc.) as well as your income and create a plan of how you will spend your money. Money management is possibly the most important part of living on your own. You must manage your money so you will have enough money to cover your expenses.


Do not allow yourself to spend more money on leisure activities (bowling, movies, eating out, etc.) than you have allotted in your budget. Otherwise, you may not be able to pay your bills.
Remember to include incidentals into your budget such as gas, insurance, furniture, clothing, repairs, ect. Try to put a little bit of money away into savings every paycheck in case you need it later.

, You will need to check your due dates for every bill and keep a note of them somewhere. You will need to decide which bills to pay every month with a certain paycheck. Try to maintain consistent, on-time payments so your credit is not adversely affected.

, Your days of someone else providing your daily nutritional intake are over. You need to figure out how you are going to eat multiple meals every day on your new budget. It can be a bit challenging at first, especially figuring out how to eat healthy on your own, but in time it will get easier.


Don’t live exclusively on frozen dinner and Ramen noodles. When you lack the nutrition your body needs, you can get sick, lose concentration and not have the energy you need to take care of yourself.
Learn to cook. There are many recipes online you can refer to in order to help you figure out what you can make with what you have. There are also meal plans and quick meal ideas that you may want to check out. Throw together a bag of rice, some cooked chicken and spinach and you have a fairly healthy, quick, inexpensive meal.Make enough for leftovers. When you do cook a meal, make enough to last more than one day. Since there is likely to be only you and possibly another person or two, this shouldn’t be too difficult. Double or triple the ingredients. Refrigerate or freeze extra for later.
Avoid spending money on fast food or going out to eat too often. While eating out is usually quicker than making food at home, it costs a lot more. These expenses can really add up.
Take advantage of invitations. When a friend or family member invites you out or over to eat, take it! It’s a chance for a good, free meal.

, Mom and dad aren’t going to tell you to take out the trash anymore or clean your room. Now it is time for you to realize why they told you to do these things. Keeping up with chores is important to avoid smells and unwanted critters like roaches, mice and ants.


Clean up messes every day, especially if they contain food particles. Sweep the floors, vacuum carpets, wipe down counters and stove tops. You’ll want to clean toilets, bath tubs, showers and mop at least weekly as well.
Wash laundry regularly. Your clothes will pile up. If you don’t want to walk around in dirty clothes, you should probably do your laundry at least once a week. If your complex or apartment has a laundry room, great. If not, then you may need to go to the laundry mat. Check the labels of your clothes to make sure you wash them correctly.
Do your dishes every day. Dishes can pile up and start to smell. You will want to wash them, either by hand or in a dishwasher. Don’t forget to dry them and put them away.
Take out the trash whenever it gets full. The trash will smell and collect more and more refuse if you don’t close it up and take it out—not to mention the mice and roaches that will be attracted to your growing pile of debris.

, Paying for repairs can get expensive. Luckily, if you live in an apartment complex, the landlord should pay for repairs. However, you need to know some basic things like where your circuit breaker box is in case the power goes out, how to change a broken light bulb and how to unclog a toilet.

, You’re on your own now, and you need to buy your own food, socks and toilet paper. Pay attention to the inexpensive, off-brand names that give you more bang for your buck. If you buy perishables like fruit and vegetables (and you should!) make sure you eat them before they go bad. Make a list before you go to the store of the things you will need for the next week according to your budget and don’t let yourself get distracted while you’re there., Use public transportation, carpool, bike or walk, if you can. Cars can be an expensive investment that adds car payments, insurance, maintenance and gas into your budget. When you’re just starting out, that nice car you’ve had your eye on may not be feasible, especially if you haven’t built up your credit yet.

, Now that you're on your own, you will probably need to make new friends and social connections as well. Look for opportunities to meet people, such as classes, parties, concerts, work and events. Go beyond just introducing yourself and making small talk.


Connect with people about things you're both passionate about. Look for clues that you might share something in common and have similar experiences or goals. Are they wearing your favorite team logo? Are they riding the scooter you always dreamed of getting? Are they studying anthropology like you plan to?
The best way to find out about people is to ask. Hold a conversation. Be genuinely interested in what someone has to say. Be sure to share about yourself during the conversation as well to create trust.

, If you don’t like crowds, bugs or being alone, deal with your fears as soon as possible to make living on your own easier. Chance are, no one’s going to swat that fly for you or entertain you all night and day. You will likely have to wade through crowds at the store or at school or work on your own. Get used to it.

If you're struggling to clear the level, don't worry about points.,
Don't give up in the face of bad luck.",How to Beat Level 76 on Candy Crush Saga," Notice that there are three different gameplay areas — two small ones on the left and a larger one on the right — divided by teleportation lines. The candy follows a predictable path as it moves through the level:



First, candy appears in the bottom left area.

Next, as pieces are cleared, candy moves through the bottom left area and falls into the board on the right.

Finally, the candy moves through the the top left board before exiting.
Thus, the ""bottom"" of the board is actually the bottom of the top left area — somewhat confusing!;
, Since you have a limited number of turns at your disposal, it's important to make every move count. This means making the most of the teleports to move your ingredients towards the exits in the top left.


Clearing candies in the bottom left area will make only the candies above them in the bottom left area move.
Clearing candies in the right area will make the candies above them in the right area and the candies in the bottom left area move.
Clearing candies in the top left area will make the candies above them in the top left area, the candies in the top right area, and the candies in the bottom left area move.
Thus, making matches in the top left area is often the most effective way to get your ingredients closer to the exit.

, If you haven't dealt with special candies and teleports before, you may have a few factors to consider in this level. See below:


Striped candies and wrapped/striped combos won't work through a teleport. In other words, if you set off a vertical striped candy in the bottom left area, it will hit candies in the two left areas, but not any on the right.
Wrapped candies won't fall through teleports unless the candies ""underneath"" them on the other side get cleared for some other reason. In other words, if you set off a wrapped candy in the bottom row of the right area, it will clear the candies around it, but it won't fall into the top left area.
Color bombs work normally.

, You only have 33 turns on this level. That may seem like a lot, but if you're not careful, you can easily find yourself left with just a few turns left and multiple ingredients left on the board. Luckily, the areas on the right side of the stage and (especially) the top left side of the stage will move a lot more candy than clearing in the bottom left area, helping you to make the most of your moves.


For example, if you have one cherry on the board in the far right column of the bottom left area and you don't have any great combinations on the board to make specials, try clearing candies in the far right row of either the area on the right or the area in the top left so that your cherry will at least make progress towards the exit.
There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For instance, it's often worth it to get a special candy even if this doesn't clear candy underneath your ingredients (especially if this special can knock one or more ingredients off the board.)

, On most ingredients levels, new ingredients usually enter the level when the ones that are on the board are cleared (though they will sometimes drop seemingly at random — the Candy Crush community has not determined exactly what will consistently trigger the release of a new ingredient.)Level 76 is no exception. This means that it's in your interest to clear each cherry as quickly as possible — the next one won't show up until you deal with the one you already have.

, Used correctly, vertical striped candies can help get your cherries those crucial last few spaces to the exit. Try to set off vertical striped candies on either of the areas on the left side of the screen so that they're lined up with your cherries — since they'll hit all of the candies in one of the top left columns, they can move your cherries up to four spaces towards the exit.


For instance, let's say that you have a cherry in the second row of the right area. If you can fire a vertical stripe candy in the second row of either of the areas on the left, your cherry will move four spaces towards the exit — not bad.

, Wrapped candies can be a huge help in this level if you're able to maneuver them into the top left area. Since they clear a 3 x 3 square twice, setting one off in the right place can move your candy up to six squares towards the exit, which is quite good.


Though rare, a wrapped/wrapped combo in the top left area is even better. Since the 5 x 5 explosion will clear most of the entire top left area twice, any cherries on the board can potentially move up to eight spaces towards the exit.This will often be enough to clear them off the board entirely.

, Though this isn't a hard and fast rule, opportunities for moving the ingredients into the two center columns and away from the edges are things you should keep an eye out for. This provides you with the most possible combinations for keeping the ingredients moving downwards and off the board since the middle two columns have candies on both side to make moves with rather than just one side.


It's also a good to get into the habit of moving ingredients away from the edges of the level. Though it isn't absolutely essential here, on future ingredients levels it can be easy to accidentally drop ingredients into corners that they are very tough to get out of, so make a point early to keep them moving towards the center.

, When you mix a striped candy and a wrapped candy, you'll create a combo which clears three rows and three columns in a cross pattern. This can be very useful on this particular game board, especially if you're luck enough to hit the candies in the top left area with it. However, this needs to be done as quickly as possible, so as not to use up moves.

, Perhaps the single most useful combo you can get in this level (besides the extra-rare color bomb/color bomb combo) is to combine a color bomb and a striped candy. This will create random striped candies all over the board on the candies that are the same color as the striped candy you used. Generally, this will clear most if not all of the board very quickly, which often means you'll clear one or more cherries off the board in a single move.

, On this level, it's more important than normal to pay attention to the placement of your moves. Try to avoid making matches that don't move your cherries towards the exit (or, in other words, matches that lie above your cherries.) There may be times when you have to do this (especially when your ingredients have almost reached the end), but these moves shouldn't be your priority since they don't get you closer to beating the level.


For this reason, you'll almost always want to avoid making matches in the bottom left section entirely. An exception to this is if you can make a valuable special candy, especially one like a vertical striped piece that can hit the pieces in the top left.

, In general, vertical striped candies are more highly prized in this level than horizontal striped candies because, with their ability to clear an entire vertical column, they can get an ingredient many spaces closer to the exit. By contrast, horizontal striped candies will usually only get an ingredient a single space closer to the exit. Often, this isn't worth the extra moves needed to get the horizontal striped candy in the first place.


As always, however, there are exceptions. For instance, if you can line up a horizontal striped candy with the last row of candy above the exit, you can use it to get your ingredients past that crucial last space.

, With 30,000 points required for one star, level 76 doesn't have particularly demanding point requirements. If you're having a hard time balancing your efforts to create point-winning combos and clear all of the ingredients, try forgetting about points and focusing only on clearing the cherries. Odds are that you'll probably get enough points from this alone to clear the 30,000 mark.


Note that when you clear an ingredients level, a random striped candy appears on the board for each turn you have in reserve. These special striped candies score 3,000 points apiece when they fire (not counting any additional points from cascades that are triggered as a result), so clearing the board as quickly as possible is a great way to rack up major points., Unfortunately, unless you're willing to shell out cash for bonuses, a good amount of your success in Candy Crush Saga will be determined by luck. The candies that fall onto the board are completely random — it's possible to simply ""be dealt a bad hand"" and to get stuck in a situation where beating the level it difficult if not impossible. Don't give up! Stick with the strategies above and you'll beat level 76 in no time.

Use breast shells.,
Use a breast pump.,
Use an inverted syringe.,
Use the Niplette.,
Use Supple Cups.",How to Get Rid of Inverted Nipples3," Breast shells are sold at maternity stores and online. They are soft, circular discs with a small hole in the middle that pushes the nipple forward.


Cup your breast inside the shield and position your nipple through the small hole.
Wear the breast shell under your shirt, undershirt or bra. You may need to have an extra layer of clothing to hide it adequately.
If you are preparing to nurse, wear the shell for 30 minutes prior to breastfeeding.The shell applies gentle pressure to your nipple to encourage it to stay erect. It can be used by men and women as a treatment for inverted nipples.
The breast shell may stimulate lactation in breastfeeding women. Nursing mothers should not wear them continuously for days on end. If you wear the shell during feedings, be sure to wash it in hot, soapy water afterwards, and dispose of any milk leaked into the shell during wearing. Monitor the area around your breast when using breast shells, as they may cause rashes., If you are pregnant or nursing, use your breast pump to evert the nipple tissue.


Place the phalange over your breast, ensuring your nipple is centered inside the hole. Phalanges come in different sizes, so be sure the phalange you're using covers your nipple.
Hold the phalange against your breast, ensuring a seal against your skin.
Holding the phalange or bottle in one hand, turn on the pump.
Pump at the highest comfortable strength.
Turn off the machine by holding both bottles against you with one arm and turning off the pump with another.If you are nursing, give the nipple to your baby once your nipple is erect.
Don’t pump extensively if you are nursing, since it will start the flow of milk from your nipple.
There are a variety of breast pumps on the market; high-quality electric pumps like those used at a maternity ward do the best job of pulling the nipple out without damaging surrounding tissue.
Breast pumps vary from one manufacturer to another. Talk to a nurse or lactation consultant about the best way to use the particular pump you're working with.

, Pull out your nipple using a clean, needleless 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) syringe (this size may vary depending on your nipple size).


Use clean, sharp scissors to cut off the end of the syringe where it reads ""0 mL"". (The side opposite to the plunger.)
Remove the plunger and reinsert it at the end you just cut off, pushing the plunger all the way in.
Place the uncut end over your nipple and draw out the plunger so that your nipple protracts.
Do not pull farther than is comfortable.
Before removing, push the plunger slightly back in to break the suction.
Once finished, disassemble all parts and wash with hot, soapy water.
If you prefer, there is a medical device called Evert-It, which is a modified syringe with a breast phalange. It works on the same principle described above.

, The Niplette is a device that elongates the milk ducts by pulling on the nipple for an extended period. This small, clear, plastic device is worn over the nipple and under clothing.


Apply a small amount of nipple ointment to the nipple and areola and the base of the Niplette.
Insert the syringe into the open end of the valve, pushing firmly.
Place the Avent Niplette over your nipple with one hand and pull the syringe with the other, creating suction. Don't pull too hard - this should not be painful!
Once the nipple has been pulled out, release the Niplette.
Grasp the valve and carefully remove the syringe from the valve. Do this carefully so that no air is re-injected, which would cause the device to fall off.
Wear your Niplette under your clothing. If you're wearing a tight top, you can conceal the Niplette with a specially designed protective cover.
Remove the Niplette by pushing the syringe into the valve to break the vacuum.
Start by wearing the Niplette for one hour per day. Gradually increase by one hour each day, working up to eight hours per day.
Do not wear the Niplette day and night!
Within three weeks you should see results, with the nipple filling the mould., Supple Cups sold online have been designed to help address flat, shy and inverted nipples, by drawing the nipple into the cup. Clinically proven, permanent correction has been observed in inverted nipple clinical trials, in as little as a few weeks.

Center the Supple Cup onto the nipple and squeeze the bottom of the Supple Cup as you gently press it onto the nipple. This creates a gentle vacuum, drawing the nipple into the Supple Cup.
For an improved seal, apply a small amount of nipple cream or butter – such as USP modified lanolin – on nipple and interior of the Supple Cup. If that still doesn’t work, you may want to try a different size.
New users typically wear Supple Cups for 15 minutes on the first day. If no pain or discomfort is experienced, one may advance the time each day, gradually increasing to four hours per day by the end of the first week.
Some are able to wear the Supple Cups under a bra without the Supple Cup being displaced or without discomfort. Alternatively, Breast Shells can be used in conjunction with Supple Cups to prevent a tight bra from flattening out the Supple Cups or from causing uncomfortable pressure or from being detached from the nipple.

Say it, sing it: Looking in the mirror, say a phrase you want to sing in your best expressive speaking voice.,
Upward slide: Try this exercise only if you can successfully breathe from the body and do the downward slide.,
Sneeze: Imagine a tickling feeling inside behind your nose and eyes similar to what you feel right before you sneeze.,
Pointy Triangle: This works well, especially for many women.,
Vowel Columns: Each vowel has a top part and a bottom part, visualized like a column of air or an organ pipe.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing5," Then sing it, but don't change your mouth shape. This is best done in a medium low vocal range. It help you find a vowel that sounds alive. If you know you have a poor speaking voice and lazy vowels, it may help you to pretend you are someone else you know who has a good speaking voice. Singing right after saying it helps you find your natural vowel shape and avoid pitfalls of having the mouth too closed or unnaturally wrenched open for singing., Let your mouth and throat be loose. Get a body breath and do a loose, very slidy siren on ""ah"" oozing slowly upward. Keep the breath moving, and let it move faster as you go higher in pitch. The impetus of the increased air should naturally make your face want to open up to make room for more air. Let the face do that. While most people will not open up enough for their high notes by intuition, most people's faces will open up for them on this exercise. It becomes a gauge by which you can find how open your vowel must be and how much air it must ride on to sing with ease in the high range., Sing your vowels with that added tickle behind them. This is one way to get a clear, ringing sound in your vowels., Think of a triangle with a very small point at the peak behind the bridge of your nose. Let this triangle be there as you sing., If you sing with the vowel well-formed behind the eyes but not seated on the low-body breathing mechanism, you are lacking the low part, and vice versa. You want to feel the whole length of every vowel, both the ringing part behind the eyes and the settled part within the body. In the upper ranges, you may feel more lift of air behind the vowel, but it should still be a column, though the column may seem to have a point on the top. Feel like you are letting each vowel bloom into its full shape. (See, how important word images are to vocal instruction? If you hate word images, you may want to pursue some other hobby than vocal music.)"

Take a deep breath when you are angry: Though that may sound cliché, you can literally take a deep breath, which will help to calm down.,
Take a step back from the situation.,
Pray about it.,

, If angry at a person, it generally helps to leave the room until you have calmed down. Don’t say something you will regret later: think about “I've hardly ever regretted anything that I didn’t say.""



Think about why you are angry. Are you misinterpreting the situation?

Ask for clarification after you have calmed down. See whether you misunderstood what was said to or about you.

, Ask God to help you with your anger.

, It doesn’t possess us, but it can oppress us and kind of control us at different times.


You can say boldly, “In the name of Jesus, spirit of anger I command you to leave. You are not welcome here.”
Or another good phrase to say aloud is, “By the power and blood of Jesus, 'Satan be gone!' ”
It may then feel like something that is controlling your mind and emotions left. There are demons or even bad attitudes that can control us in certain ways, if we let them.

, So always be very careful when angry. Anger can ""open a window"" to Satan in your mind and heart.

, Don’t just stuff your anger.


“Don’t let the sun go down on your anger"" means that you need to address what you are angry about.

, Jesus said, ""Love one another.' Love covers a multitude of sins (by forgiving).


Don’t just ""not speak"" the truth, even if you are afraid of how the person will react.
Tell the person who made you angry how you are feeling, but do it gently.
Even if the person doesn’t say ""I'm sorry"", forgive anyway. Why? Because God commands you to and also because holding onto bitterness won’t help you at all.

, Headaches are a well known physical result of anger and worry. Emotions affect the physical body; so if only for the sake of your own health, let go of your anger. Forgive whatever happened, and move on.

,


An example would be, someone cutting you off on the road.
You might also want to get angry at mistakes you make, like losing your phone, etc. But try not to. That will raise your blood pressure, your stress levels and cause you to not live as long.

,,


A lot of stress we bring on ourselves; we can cause much of our own stress.
Always remember, “It’s not about what happens to you that matters, but how you respond to it.”
We can control our own responses to things. If we determine in our minds that we will stay calm no matter what, then we can. Ask God for help to stay at peace, and He will help you.

,


There is a book by Cloud and Townsend titled Boundaries that may help you a lot.
Often times people get angry when they feel like a line has been crossed in some way. But, if other people never know what those lines are, how can you justify getting angry about it -- right? So you need to express to people what your lines or boundaries are.

,


Maybe you get mad easily, if someone is late, or if things are messy. Present your desires to people. Explain what areas you are more sensitive in or have more needs in. There may or may not be compliance with what you want. If not, then accept it and move on. But at least you will know that you tried to express yourself and what you wanted.
Often times anger builds up when we don’t express ourselves. We may feel stuck or trapped for some reason. Communicating about things will help bring freedom in any area. Anger or hurt may come when we feel ignored or disrespected.
Build more of a relationship through talking, showing interest and kindness; so you won’t feel ignored. Don’t expect people to read your mind or intuitively know what you need at any time; you have to tell them your ideas and needs. Listening and communicating is always very key to setting justifiable boundaries.

, Unresolved anger is not conducive to humility.


Often anger comes from one's own ego and pride, as when not getting ones own way and becoming angry. But remember, it’s not all about you, as there are six billion other people on the planet that have their own wants and needs too.
If what you want conflicts with what others want, sometimes you will have to let them have what they want.

, Everyone is not here to meet ones needs alone. Each person needs to take care of oneself, if competent.


Sometimes the angry person is on an ego trip. That is when a person shows/demands that everyone must cater to that person's desires by doing things his or her way.

, But, that may be for others or God to decide. No one but God is always right. No one can manage the universe, or be perfectly good.


Paul says in Romans 12, “Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.” Often times anger comes when we have a high opinion of ourselves and the way we think things SHOULD be done. But no one is perfect. None of us has a perfect way of doing things.
There is a need to allow for differences in other people and different opinions on things. It is never one person is right and everyone else is wrong. Admit that sometimes you might be wrong too.
Always remember to stay humble and not think of yourself as perfect or better than you are. If you are able to see that you too make mistakes all the time, then you will have more grace for other people, and you will then become angry less often. Amen.

,


Jesus was angry many times, and yet he was without sin.
Getting angry is not the sin; how you handle your anger is what can become a sin. Gossiping about people is a passive aggressive way to act out your anger. It’s better to confront the person directly. When Jesus was angry at the Pharisees, he didn’t gossip about them with his disciples: He confronted them directly.

, Don’t explode, but don’t implode (cave-in) either.


Don’t stuff it and hold it in, because that does just as much damage to a relationship as exploding on someone. Both can limit the freedom in a relationship.
If someone shuts down or gets overly angry with you, you won’t feel as free to talk and be with him or her. Be open but gentle about your anger, by always “speaking the truth in love.”

,


Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” #*Likewise the apostle Paul said, “As far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men.” Paul also said, “Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life.” Those are some great verses regarding keeping the peace.
Another great verse is, “Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” Amen.

Chain the desired amount of stitches.,
Slipstitch into the first chain to connect the round.,
Chain two and half-double crochet the second round.,
Chain two and half-double crochet into third loop.,
Continue to chain two and half-double crochet into third loop.",How to Crochet the Camel Stitch2," Start by creating a chain of however many stitches you need to complete your project.Check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches you will need to chain.


For a thick scarf, you might make a chain of 30 to 50 stitches, depending on the size of your yarn and crochet hook. Then, you could work this chain in the round until it is the length you want it to be. You could also make a cowl in this way.
To work in the round for a hat, start with a chain of five. This will allow you to work the camel stitch outwards from a small circle. If you choose to work the camel stitch this way, then your garment will have a spiral look to it., After you finish your chain, use the slipstitch to connect in in a circle.Be careful not to twist the chain.


To do a slipstitch, insert your needle through the back loop of the beginning of the round, then loop the working end of your yarn over the hook, and pull this loop through the back stitch.This will connect the beginning and end of your round.

, To work in the camel stitch, begin by chaining two and then half double crochet. Continue to half-double crochet all the way around the circle. When your each the end of the round, use a slipstitch to connect the yarn back into the circle., For the third round, start by chaining two and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is the one behind the back loop. You can locate it by turning the stitches slightly. This stitch is called the third loop because it is the third stitch from the front. Continue to HDC into the third loop to the end of the round.Use a slipstitch to connect the end of the round with the beginning of the round.

, For the fourth round and each round after this one, chain two and then HDC to the end of the round. Finish each round with a slipstitch to connect the beginning and end of the round.Keep crocheting until you reach the desired length.

Be certain the diagonal cut is slightly longer than your slit length.
When measuring where the bottom cut should begin, keep in mind that you are cutting twice the width that you are looking at because of the fold in your material (e.g. 4.5 inches will open to 9 inches).
The reason for doing two pieces at once is to ensure that your gussets match in size and shape.

,,,, It is best if you use the same amount of seam allowance as was used to create the pants.

,, This will reinforce both your long seam as well as the top of the slit opening. You may want to backstitch several times over the top point of the slit to prevent unraveling later.


As you top stitch, you will need to hold the area being sewn flat while allowing the pant leg to bunch up around the presser foot.

Create an action plan.Select an aspect from you personal or professional (school) life that you’re dissatisfied with.,
Seek out a mentor.If there is someone in your life that pursues risks and acts as you feel you could act, approach them.,
Begin to experiment.,
Increase your self-esteem.,
Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not.,
Be happy with the way that you look.",How to Get a Boyfriend if You're Very Shy3," Take a moment to reflect on your previous week. Were there any times where you felt like you could have stepped up and done something differently? Take a few moments to think about what you would have done, and if that would have made you happier


For instance, if you see an acquaintance at the supermarket, you pretend like you never saw them. Instead of letting them notice you first, say “hello” right when you see them.

, You don’t need to ask them if they’ll mentor you into getting a boyfriend, but just ask them out for lunch or coffee. Be honest with them and explain that you struggle with being shy and you’re trying to build confidence.


Be sure you can trust this person before talking to them.
If you are out of people, talk to a guidance counselor or even a therapist for advice.

, Build your confidence by forcing yourself into a new experience. Take a small risk by following your impulse. You can start small by going out to dinner alone, take a class on an exciting subject, or repair an appliance by yourself. When you accomplish something, you feel better and your self-confidence improves.


Do something society doesn’t deem “ladylike.” For instance: take a class on welding.
If you’re feeling too shy to out to an event or a class alone, get a trusted friend to join you.
Try to do a small risk every week.

, Many women feel from societal pressures of beauty that they aren’t good enough. This simply is not true and just happens to be the negative side of western culture. Care about your appearance, but don't let that consume you. Project self-esteem by dressing in a way that makes you feel attractive. Another way to improve your self-esteem is by challenging your negative thoughts like:


Discard an all or nothing mentality that could lead you to think: ""if he doesn't notice me in this dress, then I must be ugly.""
Be proud of yourself instead seeing a positive as a negative like: ""I was only chosen to lead the debate because no one else wanted to.""
Change the way you handle negative thoughts. For example: If something got to you during school, come up with thoughts or activities that will reduce your stress., You must have something good about yourself and your personality, so let that shine through. Don't cover yourself up by trying to be what you think he might want. The best way to build confidence is by believing in yourself.


One way to be yourself is to expose what you like. If you love a band or musician, wear a fan t-shirt. If you’re enjoying a book you are reading, bring it to school or work.
Talk openly about what you are genuinely interested in. It will be hard at first, but talking to anyone about a mutual interest is healthy.

, Find a new way of doing your hair, dress a little differently from your usual, use your favorite make up. If you feel good about yourself, it'll show. If you're unhappy with the way you look, then do something about it. If you don't like your hair then change it.

If you're looking to update your look, you probably found a style you liked in a particular era and never bothered to change with the times. Which era would describe your wardrobe?;
, They can be found at any bookstore. Typically, they have a beautiful, well-dressed model or celebrity on the front cover. Pick one up and flip through it observantly. Times have changed, huh?

, Celebrities often double as fashion icons, prancing around in the latest fashions. Don't waste times on seeing what celebrities wear to major formal events (an expensive gown won't necessarily update your look). Instead, try to find out what they're wearing on a day-to-day basis.

, You don't have to throw out every piece of clothing to update your look. There are some things that never go out of style(cardigans, blouses, fitted t-shirts) and some things that might be back in style (e.g. bell bottom jeans--those with flared legs--were big in the 70s, then fell out of favor during the 80s, and returned, though not as dramatically, in the 90s and have been lingering ever since).A lot of people favor the skinny jeans these days. The key to updating your look is knowing the difference. Plus, there are certain things that are out and that you should never wear again, if you want to have an updated look (e.g. tie dye).

, These days, almost anything goes. Just remember to go with a haircut that accents your face, and a color that makes your skin glow and pop. Remember to be upfront with the hairdresser. A silent client could end up regretting the change.


Match your flowy twenties styled shirt, with skinny jeans and maybe 80s army boots. You can wear a shag hair cut, and carry a leather messenger bag.

, They are big on decades flashbacks. You'll find everything from Victorian twist to Electric Funk.

,


Have sufficient casual wear for errands.
Have work wear that can also be worn at a special event.
Have a few outfits for evening wear.
Change work wear to casual wear when it's out of style.

, List all possible outfits, including accessories.


Layering clothes will extend your wardrobe.
Black and navy should go well with everything and are always in fashion.
Skirts with a slight flare and gathering are a good choice.

Pants with a slightly flared leg are a good choice.
Clothes that are too narrow or too wide may be out of style.
Ballet flats or shoes with a slight heel go well with everything.

,


Modify something that is slightly stylish into something you'll enjoy wearing. Add lace, embroidery or beads.
Find classic, simple sewing patterns. Make smaller tops, skirts or pants. Try a halter top with capris.
Sew simple accessories needed to complete an outfit. Try a headband, fabric belt, fun purse or tote bag.

,


Buy something only if it's exceptional. Take time to think it over.
Complete your classic wardrobe, but add a few current styles.
Keep certain fabrics in mind to recycle them at a later time.

, Enhance the color of your eyes or hair, your skin tone and physique.


Choose two or three colors that are easy to mix and match.
Clothes should follow the contour of your body.
Clothes should glide over your body whether sitting or standing.
Generally, we increase in size as we age. Purchase a larger size.
Wear a belt with a large top or dress.
Wear a large top over a smaller top.
Take the side seams in temporarily.
Look for slimming lines, such as a v-neck or empire waist.
Shades of the same color are slimming.



,


Place tops, skirts and pants in their own section.
Sort everything by color. Place your blue tops together. Place your black pants together.
Keep your list of outfits in a handy place.

Practice listening more than you speak.,
Control your environment.,
Be assertive using communication skills instead of volume.,
Assimilate with the group.,
Breathe from the diaphragm.,
Relax your throat.,
Vary your volume level.,
Enlist the help of someone else.,
Listen to yourself speak.,
Test your hearing.,
Assess your competition.,
Question your motives.",How to Stop Speaking So Loudly," Take the competition out of your conversations by being an active listener. Truly engage with what the other person is saying. Avoid interrupting. Listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you want to say next. This way you will not feel the need to raise your voice to be heard over theirs, but can be involved in the conversation on an even playing field., Do your best to change the elements in your environment which may cause you to increase the volume of your voice. The more you can adjust the environment to be ideal to hearing what you are saying, the less need you will feel to speak loudly.Get rid of exterior sounds by closing windows and doors.
Move closer to the person or people you are talking to. The more distance between you and your audience, the more likely you will feel the need to raise your voice to fill the void.
Speak in a small room. Large rooms eat up sound, and you may feel the need to speak up. Choose small rooms for quieter communication.

, Your opinions are valid and deserve to be heard. If you feel that the other person isn’t listening, practice communicating assertively without raising your voice.Meet the other person where they are at. Try to understand where they are coming from and let them know that you get it by saying something like, “I understand you have been under a lot of stress lately,” or, “I know that you are busy right now, so I will be quick.”
Stay positive when you are speaking negatively. Even though you disagree with a person, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you dislike the person. There is certainly no need to disrespect them.
Say “no.” Sometimes it’s as simple as just learning to say, “no.” If there does not seem to be a solution in sight, you can end the conversation and walk away rather than escalating the argument and raising your voice.

, When speaking with a group of people, there is an urge to talk over others, one-up the other people, or hijack the conversation. As people continue to make these mistakes in a group, the entire group will increase in the volume of their speech.Wait for your opportunity to be heard rather than speaking over someone.
Use body language to indicate that you would like to speak. Try raising a finger, nodding, or shaking your head.
When you do have the floor, make your point quickly, before someone else jumps in.

, Place one hand at the top of your stomach and the bottom of your rib cage. Inhale into this area and attempt to make your hand rise using your breath. This will put your breath in the right place rather than pushing speech from your nose, chest or mouth. Forcing breath from these places can be grating and loud.Once you have the breath in your diaphragm, try vocalizing from the place where you are resting your hand.

, Having tension in your neck can lead to trying to force the sound out of your throat. Relax your throat in order to relax your voice. Place one hand on your neck and speak normally to assess the tension in your throat. Drop your jaw as low as you can and take in a large yawn. Release the air slowly with a gentle hum. Repeat this several times until you begin to feel your throat relaxing.
Once your throat is relaxed, continue dropping your jaw, then exhaling with words like “hang, harm, lane and loam.”
Massage your neck throughout this process if you feel it tightening.

, This will help you be heard as well as hearing yourself. Speaking at the same volume, tends to have the effect of the listener tuning the speaker out. This could lead to frustration and tempt the speaker to be even louder. Experiment with varying your volume level. Creating variety in your volume will allow you to be more conscious of your volume and see the effect on your listener.
Try speaking at almost a whisper.
Make your voice quieter until someone asks you to speak up.
Try raising your volume only on the word you would like to emphasize. “That pizza was the BEST!”

, It can be difficult to hear yourself. Ideally you would hire a coach to be an outside ear. They can assess your volume and your needs, then lead you through some exercises which will help you learn how to control your voice. I this is not an option for you at this time, ask a friend to give you feedback.Voice coaches can lead you through some breathing exercises, as well as running through the range of pitch and volume with your voice.
If you are working on your own, ask a friend if they have noticed a difference. Give them permission to point out when you raise your voice. When they do point it out, don’t get angry. Remember that they are trying to help you.

, There are two ways that sound reaches the inner ear, through air and bone. Usually, the sound you hear when you speak is a combination of these two pathways. Some people are more sensitive to one or the other.Listening to a recording of yourself eliminates the bone-conducted sound as there is no vibration from the vocal chords to create this pathway. This is why your voice sounds different when you are listening to a recording of yourself.
Try wearing earplugs to eliminate the sound conducted by air.
Some abnormalities of the inner ear can lead to extra sensitivity of the the bone transfer of sound to the point where you can hear the automatic systems of the body like breathing and moving your eyes.
See if eliminating one of these pathways has a significant effect on your hearing.

, Speaking too loudly can be a sign of hearing loss. Other signs of sensorineural hearing loss are difficulty hearing when there is a lot of background noise, and understanding what people are saying with clarity. If you are experiencing these symptoms, see your physician and get your hearing checked., People in positions of power are often trained to speak loudly and with authority, but it also comes naturally to some who have been assigned or consider themselves to be in a high position of power.Where do you place yourself in rank of power?
What effect is this having on the people around you?
Would it benefit you to reduce your vocal intensity to better communicate on the same level?

, Some people speak loudly because they feel that they are not being heard. Another reaction to this feeling is constantly repeating yourself. If you find yourself doing these things, the cause of speaking loudly could be related to your need to have your thoughts heard."

Try to bring both of your friend groups together so that it is a social meal. This will let your boyfriend see you every day, even if you are in the middle of your studies.

, It is best not to have a date on a school night. You can plan your dates for Friday night, any time Saturday, or during the day on Sunday.

This will liven up your relationship.Try to avoid talking about school or your studies during your date.

, If you cannot see your boyfriend much during the week, you can still talk to him. While you should not distract yourself while studying, do send him texts throughout the day. A good morning and a good night text are good for letting your boyfriend know that you are thinking about him. After school, ask him how his day went.

, School is a place for studying. You should try to avoid any romantic conflict while you’re at school. If you’re annoyed at your boyfriend, ask him if you can talk privately after school, but try not to have a fight in the hallway or cafeteria. This will publicize your argument, and you may not be able to settle the matter maturely while in a public setting.You can also follow the 48 hour rule. If your boyfriend angers you, wait two days. If you’re still angry, you can bring it up with him. Otherwise, it might be a minor issue, and you can drop it."

Compose your email’s subject.,
Include the proper salutations.,
Write the body of your message.,
Include a closing remark.,
Add a signature.",How to Format an Email," The subject line of an email message serves as a short summary of what the message is all about. Your subject line should be straightforward and concise that it’s able to give the recipient an idea on what is the topic of your email in just a few simple words.


In example, if you’re writing to someone about some business, do not complicate the subject line with too many details like “I like the car you’re driving. I love its blue color and the wheels are gorgeous.”
Clearly state your motive directly on the subject line. In example: “Interested buyer of your blue sedan.”;
, Don’t instantly start off the email with what you need to say. Include common salutations like “Greetings” or “Good day.” You wouldn’t want a random person go up and immediately talk to you without even greeting you, would you? It’s the same for emails.


To make your greeting more personal, include your recipient’s last name in your salutation.

, Depending on the kind of message you’re writing and who you’re sending it to, you can write it however you want.


If you’re writing to someone close to you, you could make your email sound personal; but if you’re writing a business letter, you need to keep the email as professional as you could.
You also need to keep in mind the format of your message. Do not use hard-to-read font styles, sizes, and formats, and avoid using capital letters. Uppercase letters, in the digital world, resembles shouting.

, Don’t just end your email where your message ends. Write closing remarks like “Sincerely,” “Best regards,” or anything you think that will go best with the email you’re composing.


Closing remarks should definitely go well with your email. Why? Because if you’re writing a business message, you wouldn’t want to write “Lovingly yours” as the closing remarks for your letter; it would be inappropriate.

, Although your email address already includes your name on every email you send, it’s still recommended that you include a signature along with every message you compose. Signatures can be just plain text or, if you want to be creative, pictures (like logos, brand marks, etc.).


Use the Signature option of whatever webmail or email client application you have to create your own signature.

Consider using combination therapy instead.",How to Prevent Acinetobacter Infection," Acinetobacter bacteria pose very little risk to healthy people within their day-to-day lives; however, very ill people within hospitals, particularly if they have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or diabetes, are much more susceptible to Acinetobacter and risk dying from the infection.As such, the goal is to avoid being in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a patient or visitor.


Most people admitted to the ICU have little chance of preventing it, but following medical advice for any chronic lung diseases or diabetes can prevent your condition from taking a turn for the worse and needing emergency care.
Getting transferred out of the ICU into another part of the hospital for recovery may also reduce your risk of an Acinetobacter infection. Ask your care givers about your recovery options.
Healthy people aren't normally at risk, but visiting ill relatives at hospitals can increase it, especially if you spend significant time in the ICU.;
, A crucial way for reducing your risk of getting any type of bacterial or viral infection while staying in a hospital (or visiting one) is washing your hands properly and frequently. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom and after you touch any person (patient or hospital staff) or surface outside the bathroom. Be especially cautious with door knobs, light switches, bed railings, curtains, bedside tables and any type of medical equipment.


Warm water and regular soap is probably enough to sanitize your hands from bacteria, but consider using an alcohol-based cleaner also.
Use the paper towel you dried your hands with as a barrier against door knobs and bedside rails. Once you climb back into bed (as a patient), throw the paper towel away in the garbage.
Make sure to have some hand sanitizer within reach of your hospital bed at all times.

, Even if you're frequently sanitizing your hands as a patient or visitor to the hospital, try not to habitually touch your face (especially your mouth and eyes) with your hands. Bacteria on your hands are usually harmless, but they can enter your body through your mouth or eyes and become infectious. As such, focus on keeping your hands by your sides or on your lap.


If you don't wear eyeglasses, consider putting on some plastic eye protection to prevent touching or rubbing your eyes.
If you're a woman, be very cautious about transmitting bacteria (and other germs) while putting on eye makeup and lipstick. If you're a hospital patient, it's safer not to wear any makeup.Pay attention to other objects people commonly put in their mouths without thinking, like pens and pencils, and anything shared, like phones or games.

, While in a hospital, it may be tempting to compassionately touch patients, but that dramatically increases your risk of Acinetobacter infection — particularly if you're also a patient and quite ill. Hospital patients can harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria (such as Acinetobacter) on their skin, clothing or personal items.


Talking, listening and supporting hospital patients is certainly helpful, but avoid touching them, especially if they're in the ICU.
If you're a patient in a hospital, avoid sharing any towels, washcloths, razors or clothes with other patients.

Acinetobacter spreads to susceptible patients by person-to-person contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.
If you're near a coughing patient(s), consider wearing a surgical mask for additional protection. Bacteria can travel within droplets of saliva/mucus.

, Whether you're a patient or a visitor, never touch any medical equipment or machines while in a hospital or clinic setting, especially while in an ICU or emergency ward. They are often a source of bacteria and other microbes, and touching them may also alter their function or change the settings, which can be life-threatening.Don't let curiosity get the best you and keep your hands to yourself and let the professionals deal with and clean the medical equipment.


Medical equipment most likely to be contaminated with bacteria include urinary catheters, intravenous equipment and respiratory tubes/paraphernalia.
In general, any equipment that deals with giving or taking blood/urine/fluid from you is higher risk of being contaminated with Acinetobacter and other microbes.

, In addition to medical equipment and other patients, another source of Acinetobacter contamination is the hospital staff — doctors, nurses, assistants and technicians. They get trained on how to prevent spreading bacterial infections by washing their hands and keeping clean, but some are more conscientious about it than others. As such, remind or request that all hospital employees wash their hands and sanitize their equipment before treating and touching you.Offer them the use of your alcohol-based hand sanitizer if they don't have any. Be polite and try not to offend them.
Wearing disposable gloves protects hospital staff from patients, but ask caregivers to change their gloves in front of you for your protection from Acinetobacter and other harmful microbes.
Hospitals that have more conveniently placed hand sanitizer dispensers have higher hygiene compliance from staff — up to 80% or more., Aseptic techniques are procedures used in hospital settings designed to sterilize any equipment or treatment materials used on you during your stay.All diagnostic equipment and instruments used on you should be brand new (never used), sanitized with alcohol or covered in some sterile protective covering.


Caregivers should change their gloves, masks and sanitary covers just prior to treating each patient (preferably within your view).
Caregivers should not wear rings, jewelry and even watches while treating patients because they are hard to clean and keep sanitized.

, Acinetobacter, especially the baumannii strain, is recognized as a very difficult antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to control and treat.In general, the overuse of antibiotics within hospitals has created these drug resistant ""superbugs,"" and the incidence of potentially life-threatening Acinetobacter infections are increasing.


As such, first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and penicillins are virtually useless against Acinetobacter activity and may actually promote their growth.The most common problems caused by Acinetobacter colonization are bacteremia (blood infection), pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infections and wound infections., Acinetobacter is resistant to most antimicrobial drugs, but not all of the newer, stronger ones. Antibiotics usually effective against A. baumannii include carbapenems, polymyxins E and B, sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, tigecycline and aminoglycosides.Which one your doctor recommends depends mainly on where your bacterial infection is, how your immune system is combating it and your overall health.


As a general rule, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) are the top choice for treating A. baumannii, though carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter strains are becoming more common in the U.S. around the world.
Some other drugs used against A. baumannii include colistin, amikacin, rifampin and minocycline., Combination therapy means using two or more antibiotics at the same time within an infected patient. It has a synergistic effect on the drugs and makes them more powerful and effective — kind of like a 1-2 punch.However, side effects can be more severe also, and include stomach / intestinal problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Discuss the pros and cons of combo therapy with your doctor.


In general, combining rifampin with imipenem, tobramycin or colistin are the most effective, at least against Acinetobacter-caused pneumonia.
For most patients, monotherapy (using just one antibiotic) is just as effective as combination therapy, although if a patient is very ill with a severely weakened immune system, combo therapy is often their last hope.

Make rest and sleep a priority.",How to Lose Weight While Breastfeeding," It may seem counterintuitive, but it is important to eat regularly to lose weight. While nursing, you should never eat fewer than 1,500-1,800 calories daily, and most women require much more than this. Starving yourself is never a good idea, and is particularly dangerous when recovering from childbirth and nursing your baby. Too few calories can also be counterproductive to your weight loss goals.


Breastfeeding burns an additional 300-500 calories per day, and has been shown to reduce postpartum weight retention overall for most women even without caloric restriction.You should eat enough to satisfy that calorie requirement in addition to that of a healthy diet.
While studies have not shown that there is a significant relationship between reduced maternal intake of calories and milk production, eating too few calories can put your health at risk and increase fatigue.Eating regular meals and snacks will take the edge off of your hunger and allow you to more easily manage what you eat. If you allow yourself to get too hungry, you will end up reaching for the most convenient food available, rather than the healthiest option.
When you don’t take in enough calories, your body enters a “starvation mode” known as adaptive thermogenesis in order to reduce the amount of energy you are expending, including burning calories. This can function as a type of weight loss sabotage.;
, Eating a treat such as nuts, apple slices, or carrot sticks between meals is an excellent way to keep hunger at bay. Whether working at home or outside of it, nursing moms don’t have a lot of free time. Prepare healthy snacks in advance when you have a spare moment.


Keep healthy snacks within reach while you are nursing your baby. Nursing forces you to sit still for a moment and rest, the perfect time to grab a bite.
Try keeping nonperishable snacks, like nuts or dried fruit, in your purse or diaper bag, or in your car for easy access on the go.
Make sure to wash all fruits and vegetables. The FDA recommends washing fresh produce under running water just before eating, cutting or cooking. Using soap or commercial produce washes is unnecessary., It's advisable to wait a minimum of a full 2 months after childbearing prior to actively attempting to slim down. But during this time, you can be eating healthy and avoid junk food as much as possible. After that period has passed, try to lose weight at a slow, but steady, pace, rather than all at once. A pound and a half a week is a reasonable goal.Avoid trend diet plans, cleanses, promises of rapid weight loss, fat burning medicines, diet plan tablets and natural supplements. These things might possibly be risky for anybody, and are especially high-risk while nursing.
Studies show that losing weight too quickly puts additional stress on your cardiovascular system. Childbirth and nursing put enough stress on your body, you don’t need to add more.When you go on a crash diet, your body tends to burn muscle and lose water weight, instead of burning fat. This makes keeping the weight off a lot more difficult than if you had lost weight over a more extended period of time., Not all women experience postpartum weight loss during breastfeeding the same way. You should think about your weight loss plan as a long term, healthy lifestyle, rather than an immediate goal. Don't get discouraged if your weight loss doesn't go exactly as you hoped.


You may drop some weight quickly in the first few weeks after you deliver, but keep in mind that it will not all come off that quickly.
Don't expect results overnight. It might take a year or more to lose the additional weight you have acquired while pregnant. Unless you're a celebrity with a personal trainer, nutritionist, and live-in nanny, losing your baby weight takes time.
Some women find it very difficult to lose weight while breastfeeding and experience a greater loss in weight after they wean their baby. This may be due to lack of routine and sleep, which can contribute to overeating.
Your body also releases the hormone prolactin during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which triggers milk production. Some research suggests that if you have a higher level of prolactin, it can suppress your metabolism.When taking stock of your weight loss goals, remember that you will usually keep about three pounds of extra tissue in your breasts as long as you are nursing. , Choose foods rich in iron, protein, and calcium, as opposed to foods with empty calories or those high in fats or sugars. High protein foods are especially important because they will keep you feeling full for longer. Try to avoid foods that are highly processed or that are simple carbs, like white bread, white rice, cookies, and candy. This will help you lose weight without sacrificing your nutritional health.


Good sources of iron include whole-grain products, dark leafy vegetables, and citrus fruits.
Eggs and dairy products, as well as leans meats, soy products and meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains contain protein.
For calcium, consider dairy products or dark green vegetables. You can also find calcium-enriched products like juices, cereals, soy milk, yogurt and tofu., Not only will it help you lose weight, but a healthier diet enhances the nutritional value of your breast milk. Junk foods and fast foods offer empty calories that do not offer sustained sources of energy you need to take care of yourself and your baby.


Avoiding the extra salt, sugar and preservatives in processed foods is better for you overall.
Decrease your fat intake to 20-25% or less of total calories. Replace those fat calories with foods that are lower in fat, but higher in protein.Watch out for hidden sugars in juices and sodas that add on additional calories without nutritional benefit. Many sodas also contain caffeine, which should be limited to less than 2 to 3 cups per day. More than that can disrupt your baby's sleeping habits (and yours)., There are creative ways to chart the progress you have made in your efforts to lose weight. A weight loss chart can help you see on a daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly basis how much you have lost.


Make you own chart using an excel spreadsheet. This option allows you to include information that is most relevant to you.
Download a weight loss chart. There are many different types of weight loss charts available with just a brief online search. Many are free to download and print out.
There are examples of other types of body measurement charts available online as well. Get inspiration from what other people have done to create your own.
If you chose to chart every day, pick the same time of day in which to weigh yourself and record it. Remember that you tend to weigh the least first thing in the morning.It is easy to begin obsessing about your weight once you start to keep close track of it. Try to keep your charting within reason. Avoid weighing yourself more than once a day, and don’t get frustrated if your weight fluctuates both up and down.

, The stress that comes with a new baby is difficult to handle, but try to keep stress at bay as much as you can. Stress can get in the way of your weight loss plans. When you feel stressed, your body releases cortisol, which can increase appetite and drive you to eat more. Stress can also cause you to store extra “visceral fat” in your midsection, exactly where you probably wish to slim down the most.To reduce stress, write down your feelings and frustrations during the day, so they don’t keep you up at night. Keep a journal of your experiences with motherhood, breastfeeding, and your efforts to lose weight.
Talk about how you’re feeling. Share your thoughts with your partner or a trusted friend or relative. Commiserate about the challenges that come with a new baby with other moms online or in person.
Try to focus on good moments with your baby, rather than the struggles that come with motherhood. Keep in mind that the time your baby is of breastfeeding age is very short.
Ask for help. If you’re feeling overwhelmed with the responsibilities of breastfeeding and motherhood, reach out to those around you for help. Make sure your partner is shouldering his or her share of the burden. Ask grandparents to help take care of older children or help prepare meals.

, An exercise as easy as power walking can result in fast and efficient weight management all over, including your belly. There are several fun ways to stay active, even while taking care of a nursing baby. Power walk or run while pushing your child in a stroller around your neighborhood. This is a pleasant way to get some exercise for yourself and some fresh air for your baby.
There are many exercise strollers available on market. Some are designed for serious running, while others are more tailored to a brisk walk. Find one that suits your exercise needs.
If you dislike the bulk of pushing around a stroller, consider buying a baby carrier or sling to use on walks and outings with your baby.
Make your cardio workouts a social event. If you know other moms with young children in your area, invite them to go for a walk. This is a great way to get out and socialize, which can be difficult if you are staying home to care for your baby.
Everything in moderation. Do not exercise to the point of exhaustion, but even vigorous exercise is fine while breastfeeding (after getting the green light from your doctor post-partum of course)., There are a few extra steps you as a nursing mother should take before engaging in exercise for your own comfort and the comfort of your baby. It is important to keep your body and your breasts in good shape for nursing and milk production.


Wear a supportive sports bra when doing vigorous activity. Supporting your breasts with a well-fitting bra reduces nipple friction and discomfort. Nursing sports bras are now available for active moms.
Drink some extra water before and during your workout. An extra two of three glasses of water will help ensure that you do not get dehydrated, which can affect your milk supply.
Try to nurse before your workout. This will settle your baby, if you are bringing him or her along, and working out without engorged breasts is much more comfortable.If you sweat extensively when working out, rinse your breasts before nursing. Some babies don’t like the taste of salt., You don’t need to “bulk up” to get the benefits of weight training. Building any amount of muscle mass burns more calories, even while at rest. Building strength overall is also beneficial for carrying your baby.


Use elastic bands or weights for resistance training, and exercise at intervals that are high in intensity.
More repetitions with lower weight is just as effective at building muscle as working out with heavier weights, and less likely to cause injury.If you regularly lift weights or do exercises with repetitive arm movement, it is important to start slowly. If you find that your breasts become irritated or develop plugged ducts, cut back on these type of exercises for a while., You do not need to do 1000 sit ups to get the benefits of abdominal toning. Just tightening your stomach muscles routinely will aid in toning the muscles there.


Pilates or yoga offer many effective workouts that firm up your core. Yoga has other benefits as well, such as helping your posture after a day of pushing a stroller and lifting your baby.Try planks, or exercises in which you assume a position and hold it for a short period of time. Planks have the benefit of working several muscle groups at once, including muscles on your front, sides, abdomen, back, and even your arms., Most people need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. This is especially difficult for breastfeeding moms who are frequently required to nurse throughout the night. Getting enough rest, however, is important when trying to lose weight.


If you are tired, you will be more likely to reach for a quick shot of energy in the form of carbohydrates or sugar. Your brain’s reward centers become more active when you are tired and you might start looking for an easy fix.
A study has shown that sleeping too little leads some people to eat bigger portions of food, and thus additional calories. This can quickly derail your weight loss plans. You are also less likely to be physically active if you are not getting enough rest. Exercising or going to the gym seem impossible when you are sleep-deprived.Consider pumping your milk and allowing your partner to take over one or two feedings during the night so you can sleep.

, This is particularly true for mothers of infants. The old adage of “nap while the baby naps” is good advice. Take advantage of family members and friends who offer to watch your baby for a few hours so you can rest.


Don't spend all of your baby's nap time doing chores around the house. Take some time to rest while your baby sleeps. Let other people take over some household responsibilities. If you have older children, make a chore chart and get them to do simple and age-appropriate chores like dishes, vacuuming, or taking out the trash.
Just getting off of your feet and resting is beneficial for your body. Remember your body is working extra hard to make food for your baby, be kind to it.
Napping has additional benefits aside from helping you lose weight. A recent study has shown that mothers who nap are less fatigued overall and able to foster more positive interactions with their infants., It is very easy as a new mother to put other people first. While taking care of your baby is very important, taking care of yourself is also a necessity. There are a few strategies you can use to optimize your resting and sleeping while breastfeeding.


Say no to added responsibilities at school and work. Fight your inclination to volunteer for every activity at your older child's school or to work overtime. Set aside time to rest, as well as time to be physically active. Make yourself and your rest a priority.
Avoid caffeine, especially later in the day. Caffeine can keep you awake and destroy your chances of grabbing a few precious hours of sleep.
Make your evenings as peaceful as possible. Try to avoid watching TV, or using the computer or phone before bed.
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep by keeping it quiet, dark, and cool. If you need to, use a sleep mask for maximum darkness."

Move when the leader tells you to.,
Learn the ""On 1"" step.,
Learn the ""On 2"" step.",How to Dance Salsa3," As the follower, you must be attuned to what the leader is directing you to do. Pay attention to all the leads that your partner gives you and move instinctively in the direction that he is pushing you in.









Do not lead or pull your dance partner around. As the follower, you should wait for his lead and follow in line with the dance.

, This is the traditional Salsa step and mirrors the leader's moves described above. Use the following basic steps to dance the Salsa with your partner:








Start with both of your feet together.
On the first beat, step back with your right foot.
On the second beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the third beat, step forward with your right, starting with the ball of your foot.
On the fourth beat, hold the beat, transfer the weight to your heel, and do not take any steps.
On the fifth beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the sixth beat, step back with your right foot.
On the seventh beat, step to distribute your weight back onto the ball of your left foot.
On the eighth beat, hold the beat and do not take any steps, but distribute your weight onto your heel.

, For music that pops on the even counts, you may want to learn the ""On 2"" step, too. It's the same as the ""On 1"" variety, but on 2. It goes like this:









Start with both of your feet together.
Hold the first beat.
On the second beat, step back with your right foot.
On the third beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the fourth beat, step forward with your right, starting with the heel of your foot.
On the fifth beat, hold the beat, transfer the weight to your ball, and do not take any steps.
On the sixth beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the seventh beat, step back with your right foot.
On the eighth beat, step to distribute your weight back onto the ball of your left foot.

Again, think in terms of fast, fast, slow. For this one, 2, 3, 4 is right, left, right and 6, 7, 8 is left, right, left. Fast, fast slow -- right, left, right. Fast, fast, slow -- left, right, left.

Wrap a light blue ribbon around your braids.,
Purchase a wig.,
Carry Toto.,
Complete the look with a basket.",How to Dress Up As Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz," Make sure to find a gingham blue and white checked dress. The best pattern has small blocks of color instead of large ones.


Many costume stores sell Dorothy costumes in varying levels of authenticity, from near replicas of the movie costume to modern, updated versions with shorter hems and lower necklines. If you are not crafty, or you don't want to spend the time creating your own dress, purchasing a dress is the best option.
Browse online for Dorothy's dress. Talented people sell homemade, hand crafted versions of Dorothy's dress. You can find dresses of varying styles on crafting marketplaces like Etsy.
Sew Dorothy's dress. If you are crafty or want a more authentic look, try sewing your own dress. There are multiple sewing patterns from Simplicity, McCall's, and others available for purchase that can help you recreate Dorothy's dress.
If you are trying to replicate the outfit from the movie, make sure to pay attention to the length of the skirt. Dorothy's skirt comes just below her knees, so make sure your skirt falls to the same place.Dorothy's dress is a pinafore dress, which is a sleeveless garment usually worn by young girls as a dress over a blouse.Sewing a simple pinafore dress with a blue and white gingham fabric will serve as a great costume.;
, Dorothy's blouse was a high-necked, buttonless blouse with puffed sleeves.If you can't find an exact match, try any short sleeved blouse.

, Many major retailers sell flats or heels covered in red glitter. Dorothy's ruby slippers had bows on top, so if you want to be authentic, try to find a red sequined bow to add to the top.You can make your own red glitter shoes. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches tall. Clean the shoes, and then in small sections begin to cover the shoes with fabric glue. Apply a liberal amount of red glitter to the section covered in glue. Wait for the glue to fully dry before applying glitter to other sections or filling in holes. Touching the glitter before the glue is dry can cause bald spots. Continue applying red glitter until the shoes are completely covered in glue.Sequins can also be used when making homemade ruby slippers. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches tall. Purchase a spool of red sequin string. Using fabric glue, glue the sequin strings in vertical lines along the side of the shoes, making sure none of the shoe's original surface is peeking through. Cut the sequin string at the shoe's edge. Make sure to also cover the heel with sequins, and add a line of sequins along the mouth of the shoe.
If you want to be more authentic to the book instead of the movie, wear silver slippers instead of Dorothy's iconic red ones., Dorothy wore short ankle socks in a light blue that matched the blue in the dress. Fold down your socks. White socks might also work if you are unable to find blue; just make sure they are ankle height.

, Part of the iconic Dorothy look is her two braids, but there is a little more to the look than just parting your hair and braiding.


Part the hair in the middle from the forehead to the neck. Starting with the strands at the part on one side of the head, start twisting the hair back towards the part, adding more hair to the twist as you make your way down the hairline. Make sure to keep the twist tight.When the twist is around the ear, hold it tightly in place with one hand while you begin a three-part braid with the other. Use a simple braid to braid the hair until around the shoulders, then secure the braid with elastic.
Use a curling iron to curl the ends of the hair into ringlets. Separate the hair to form two or three ringlets., The ribbon should be tied around the elastic, at the spot where the braid ends and the curls begin. The ribbon should be tied into small bows. If the ends of the bows are too long, snip them off. The ends should barely extend past the bows. Make sure the bow is a light blue, close to the shade of blue in the dress and socks.

, If you don't have long or dark brown hair, purchase or hire a simple long brunette wig. You can get a wig already plaited, or you can add plaits.


Brown hair isn't necessary if you have the costume, the slippers, and the braids. Completing your look with the dark brown hair depends on how closely you want to match the cinematic image of Dorothy.

, If you're dressing up as Dorothy, don't forget Toto! If you don't have a real dog, or a cooperative one, buy or use a stuffed toy dog.


Toto was a darkly colored Cairn Terrier.Many retailers sell stuffed Totos that you can use to complete your costume. Some places even sell baskets with removable Totos.

, Carry a small basket, such as a picnic basket. Toto often sat in the basket, so make sure there is enough room for your dog, real or stuffed!


Dorothy's basket was open, so make sure your basket doesn't have a lid on it.

Stay in touch.",How to Help an Acquaintance Cope with Suicidal Ideations," When talking, make eye contact and if appropriate, gently touch his arm or shoulder as you chat. Sometimes the simple comfort of knowing someone else sees him as a person, or the comfort of the touch of another human being can be more meaningful than any words you can say. You don't need to get deep, you just need to show interest.;
, If you're in a crowd, say, ""I'm sorry, I can barely hear you, let's go over here where I can hear you."" And steer her out of the middle of the crush - don't try to take her off alone just yet if you don't know her very well. Once you're off to the side just a little, say, ""Now, you seem like a cool person, what kind of music do you like? Who's your favorite band?"" Try to keep it cool and don't probe just yet, allow her to get that you're a friend and she doesn't need to guard herself so much with you.

, Once you have a little privacy, turn to him and with a friendly, warm, and concerned expression, say, ""You know, you actually seem a little down. What's on your heart tonight?"" If he says, ""Nothing."" and tries to shut you down, try putting your hand gently on his shoulder (but don't allow yourself to be misinterpreted as flirting - you know the difference between the types of touch and he will, too) and say, ""I care, man. What's going on with you? You seem to be struggling with something. I may not be able to help, but I care."" Hopefully, he will relent and tell you something helpful, such as that his parents have just broken up or that someone at school is bullying him.

, Once you start talking a little, try to draw her out. Instead of talking about yourself or your own experiences that have been tough but which you have risen above (she will see through it and shut you out), ask a few leading questions. Ask, ""So what is it about your folks breaking up that feels so scary to you? They still both love you."" or, ""Listen, there are a lot of worse things that you could do than be gay/pregnant/flunking out. Are you worried your parents are going to freak out?"" if the answer is ""I don't know"" or ""yes"" to either, instead of just nodding or saying, ""uh huh,"" try saying, ""Yeah, I can feel how nervous you are."" Saying reflecting things like ""I bet that's scary to you,"" or ""Yes, I can hear your anger in your voice,"" helps in a lot of ways, but the most important way is that she understands that you actually are listening to her.

, You are there to care and help, not judge or speculate that the reason this person is in despair is because of sin in his or her life. An example is if s/he says s/he is gay, and can't reconcile his or her faith with the fact of the newly recognized sexual orientation. Do not say, ""Well, that is sinful behavior and if you want to feel better, you're going to have to get right with God."" Please remember that it is God's job to convict, correct, and judge people, not yours. Just say something more like, ""Well, you know what, I bet God loves you right where you are, and he would not want you to take your life over this. Let's go talk to my pastor if you don't want to talk with yours."" Get him or her in touch with someone who can talk a faith-based talk, but not someone who will be harsh or judgemental - hopefully you do know someone like that.

, If you are truly concerned by his demeanour and worried about his safety, even though it is the scariest thing in the world to do, and seems like the last thing you should do, you must pluck up your courage and ask some very important questions. ""Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"" ""Do you have a plan for how you would do it?"" and ""Are you thinking about carrying out your plan tonight?"" These are the most important questions of all, especially if one - or all - are ""yes"". It goes against your instinct, because your instinct is to just deny that it could be true, or it feels rude to say it so bluntly. But the truth is, many times the response is, ""At last, somebody heard me."" Often, a person with suicidal intentions feels she has been trying to tell people for a long time how miserable and how serious she is, but nobody wants to admit it. When you come out and ask, she knows she has made herself heard at last - and sometimes, that's all she really needs. Suicidal people often just feel invisible, they feel like nobody would notice or care if they died, and so the longer they walk around feeling that way, the more serious their intentions become.

, If she says she is planning to hurt herself tonight with pills she has in her purse and shows them to you, that's like a 10 on the 1-10 scale - she means it. Don't leave her alone. Ask if you can get her to some help, and take her to an ER. Wait with her until they take her in and tell the doctor that she has told you she feels suicidal and has a plan and the means to carry it out. She will probably get really angry and say she's going to hate you forever (because once you say that, they will put her in a 72 hour observation state, and she will have to stay). That's okay - you got her to help, and you hope it's a long and healthy hate. If she says, ""Well, if I was going to do it, I would probably use a gun."" ask her if she has access to a gun. If she says no, or that her dad used to have one, it's probably less lethal, more like a 5 or 6. Still, this is a serious, serious situation, and this would be the time to try to convince her to seek help. Offer to go with her. Most of these people will continue to go on their own, but need support in order to take the first step toward treatment.

, If you're a believer, by all means, be praying for him as you speak with him, but certainly, if there was ever a time to invoke a Higher Power, this is it. The act of asking ""Can I pray for you, man?"" is often very touching to him, simply because you have cared enough to ask. Keep it short - don't drone on for hours. Just make it something like, ""God, my friend Jeff here is feeling sad and alone. Help him to feel your love and help him know that he's never alone. I feel honored that Jeff has shared his heart with me tonight, and I would just ask that you draw close to him and bless him where he needs it most. Keep him safe, even as I keep him in my prayers.""

, Do not promise to keep her secrets. Tell her parents if she is a minor. This is the way to help, not to keep your promises not to tell anybody anything about what she said to you. If she's an adult, find out who her best friends are, if she has any siblings, and reach out to them with what you have learned. Tell them everything - there is no such thing as non-disclosure in suicide prevention. If she makes it through this, she will thank you.

, No matter how you leave him, it has to be better than how you found him - just caring enough to be there is 95% of helping someone in this state. You must understand that you cannot save anyone who is deadly serious about taking his or her own life. But you can save someone who is just thinking about it - some are truly serious and just caring can save their lives, and there are some that sometimes try to ""send a message"" that they are serious, or ""show someone,"" or just be dramatic by making an attempt - they don't mean to kill themselves, not really, but sometimes they do end up succeeding. You must remember that you're just one person, and hopefully, you put yourself between a hurting person and a tragedy. If it works, it's great. If it doesn't, you must not blame yourself.

, Don't go blabbing about this all over school or whatever. Of course you must tell the people who can help - their family, one close friend, a doctor. But you don't need to go around telling everyone about all the details of your encounter. It will embarrass her and make her distrust everyone when she is already in a fragile state.

, If you do see your new friend again soon after and he appears to be feeling better, just go up and say, ""Boy, am I glad to see you. You look like you're feeling better."" Don't blow their cover to all of your friends. If others ask, ""What was wrong?"" Just say, ""Oh, he was just having a bad night,"" and smile warmly. Then, be available. If he wants to talk some more, he'll know you're a friend he can trust, and he'll come to you.

Meditate.",How to Increase Serotonin Naturally2," Some types of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder, are linked to a lack of exposure to sunlight. Your body uses UV rays in sunlight to promote Vitamin D production, which is linked to serotonin production.Research has shown that sun exposure is positively correlated with serotonin production, and bright sunlight can counteract the mood-lowering effect of acute tryptophan depletion.Low sunlight levels may also increase your body’s production of melatonin, which can interfere with your body’s serotonin levels.If you don’t live in an area with bright sunlight, light therapy by using a light therapy box is an option.Consult with your doctor about which light therapy box is best for you: boxes produce anywhere between 2500 lux and 10,000 lux. Use a stronger box for at least 30 minutes every morning; lower-lux boxes may require up to two hours.Be safe outside. Choose a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and wear sunscreen whenever you go outside (even on cloudy days). Being outside in the sunshine without sunscreen dramatically increases your risk of developing skin cancer., The exact relationship between serotonin and sleep is still under scientific debate.However, serotonin does help regulate your sleep cycles. Chronic sleep deprivation has been shown to desensitize the serotonin receptor system, leading to symptoms that are similar to those seen in mood disorders (e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms).Wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day, including weekends.This consistency will help your body regulate your sleep cycle.
Avoid distractions in bed. Don’t watch TV, do computer work, or use backlit screens in bed, as these can interfere with melatonin production and may keep you awake.Limit napping. Too much napping during the day can disrupt your nighttime sleep cycle. Try to limit afternoon naps to 10-30 minutes.Have a glass of milk before bed. Milk contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose, which may help you fall asleep. Carbohydrates are also linked to serotonin production, although not directly., Exercise has natural antidepressant effects and releases endorphins, the body’s natural mood elevators. The exact relationship between exercise and serotonin production remains unclear.Moderate exercise appears to increase tryptophan levels, and may contribute to the production of serotonin. Regardless of the exact process, many research studies show that moderate, regular exercise improves your mood and reduces depressive symptoms.Aim for a minimum of 30-35 minutes of physical activity per day.Moderate activities include brisk walking, biking, jogging, swimming, and gardening.
Aerobic activities have the greatest effect on mood, and are the most likely to increase serotonin levels.Avoid exercise that is too strenuous. Over-exercising can trigger stress responses in your body, which will deplete serotonin levels. Exercise that is too difficult for your fitness level is also much harder to get yourself to do regularly. Exercise in ways you enjoy.

, Some studies show that thinking about positive events in your life can increase serotonin production. Similarly, thinking about negative emotions can decrease serotonin production.People who can view even challenging past experiences as positive (e.g., as learning experiences) are considerably more likely to feel happier overall.


Research suggests that feelings of awe and wonder promote healthy cytokine levels. When cytokine levels are too high, they can block serotonin from functioning properly. Taking a walk in nature or doing something that literally “amazes” you is actually good for your serotonin levels!, Studies have shown that petting your dog or cat can raise levels of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, which all play significant roles in your psychological well-being. Playing with your pet can also reduce your body’s stress responses.Pet owners are less likely to suffer from depression than people who do not own pets.

, Research suggests that practicing yoga regularly can significantly increase your serotonin levels. In addition, yoga reduces monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters.Several studies have shown that yoga can help reduce anxiety and depression.Sudarshan Kriya Yogic Breathing has been shown to help treat stress, anxiety, and depression.To maximize yoga’s effectiveness, you should practice a mix of asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), and meditation. Which yoga practices work best for you will depend on your fitness level and other factors; experiment to find what helps you the most., Success enhances the level of serotonin in the brain. Experiences of failure and social rejection lower serotonin levels. People who experience positive, successful social interactions and have healthy self-esteem are more likely to have high serotonin levels.Put yourself in situations that will boost your self-esteem by allowing you to take on a challenge, however small.For example, set (reasonable) goals for yourself, and celebrate your successes when you achieve them. Learn to dance, play the guitar, cook a meal, or skydive.
Research suggests that success produces a positive feedback loop: achieving your goals boosts your confidence, which boosts your ability to perform and achieve new goals.
Pursue something meaningful to you. Pursuing accomplishments that give you a sense of purpose may also increase your serotonin levels., Stress increases your body’s level of cortisol, a stress hormone. It also reduces your serotonin levels.People with poor serotonin levels can experience depression, mood swings, and stress. People who have positive, relaxed moods also have higher serotonin levels.In addition to the obvious candidates such as meditation and yoga, there are several other ways you can reduce your stress levels.Practice progressive muscle relaxation. PMR focuses on intentionally tensing and then relaxing your muscle groups, one by one. PMR can help you become more aware of your body and where you tend to carry tension. With practice, you can learn to release tension on command.Listen to pleasing music. Calm, pleasant music helps reduce your stress levels. This, in turn, may boost serotonin levels.The British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the world’s most relaxing music according to science.
Try therapeutic massage. Massage has many health benefits. It can improve symptoms of depression and alleviate anxiety. Research also suggests that massage may boost serotonin levels.Try visualization. Visualization can help you relax by using mental images to create a calm, relaxing place for you to retreat to. During visualization, you imagine a relaxing safe space in as much detail as possible, using all of your senses. The University of Houston - Clear Lake has several guided visualization exercises on their website., Deep breathing is excellent for quelling your body’s stress responses. You can get these effects from just 10 minutes of deep breathing practice.Find a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting erect.
Place one hand on your lower abdomen and one hand on your chest.
Slowly inhale through your nostrils for a count of 4. You should feel your lower belly expand as your diaphragm expands and your lungs fill with air.
Slowly release the breath through your nostrils for a count of 4.
Repeat for at least 5 minutes (but preferably 10).

, Meditation lowers stress responses in the right prefrontal cortex and amygdala. When your body is stressed, it releases cortisol, which robs your body of serotonin.Meditation also heightens activity in the left prefrontal cortex, which is associated with feelings of happiness and well-being. While no studies have proven a link between meditation and serotonin function, it is an excellent way to improve your mood and reduce stress.Mindfulness meditation has been linked to increased serotonin activity.Meditation also stimulates the lateral hypothalamus, which may elevate serotonin levels."

Eat the right foods.,
Eat the right portions.,
Get the right amount.,
Consume the right amount during pregnancy.,
Get vitamin B12 as a vegetarian or vegan.",How to Get Vitamin B12 Naturally1," Vitamin B12 is found in its highest, natural forms in animal products.It is generally not found in high levels in plant foods. The highest food sources of vitamin B12 include:


Seafood, such as clams, crab, and mussels
Beef liver
Whole grain cereals
Fish, such as trout, salmon, tuna, and haddock
Beef
Dairy products, such as yogurts and cheese, especially brie
Eggs;
, To maximize your intake of vitamin B12, you need to eat the right portions of each food. Meats and fish should be eaten in 3 ounce servings. You can drink eight ounces of milk and eat one egg to get a quality amount.


Some foods have more vitamin B12 than others. For example, clams have 84.1 mcg, mussels have 20.4 mcg, lean beef has 6.9 mcgs, and milk have 0.9 mcgs per serving.
Make sure you have a few servings of each a day to get the right amount of vitamin B12 a day., To ensure the most benefits from vitamin B12, you need to get the right amount each day. The recommended amounts you should get of vitamin B12 per day are:


0 to 6 months, 0.4 mcg
7 to 12 months, 0.5 mcg
1 to 3 years, 0.9 mcg
4-8 years, 1.2 mcg
9 to 13 years, 1.8 mcg
Over 14 years, 2.4 mcg, During pregnancy, vitamin B12 can be critically important for the development of a healthy baby. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need 2.8 mcg per day. If you do not get enough vitamin B12 while pregnant, your child might suffer from developmental delays, failure to thrive, neural tube defects, megaloblastic anemia, and movement disorders. Pregnant women often get additional vitamin B12 through prenatal vitamins, which include other important vitamins as well., Since vitamin B12 comes primarily from animal products, vegetarians and vegans who are strict on their diets need to find another source of the vitamin. The most common way that vegetarians and vegans get vitamin B12 is through foods that are fortified with it. These foods include:


Cheeses, such as Swiss, mozzarella, Tilsit, and feta
Eggs
Whey powder
Cereals
Breads
Yeast spreads (Marmite)Strict vegans don't eat cheese and egg products, so they have to rely strictly on fortified foods, especially yeast products and whey protein."

Multiply the first two binomials, temporarily ignoring the third.,
Combine the leftover binomial with your new equation.,
Multiply the first number in the binomial by all three numbers in the other parenthesis.,
Multiply the second number in the binomial by all three numbers in the other parenthesis.,
Add together the two answers from multiplication.,
Simplify the equation to get your final answer.,
Always use distribution to tackle larger multiplication problems.",How to Multiply Binomials2," Take the example (x+4)(x+1)(x+3). We need to multiply the binomials one at a time, so multiply the any two by either FOIL or distribution of terms. Multiplying the first two, (x+4) and (x+1) with FOIL would look like this:



First: x*x = x2


Outer: 1*x = x

Inner: 4*x = 4x

Last: 1*4 = 4

Combine terms: x2 + x + 4x + 4
(x+4)(x+1) = x2 + 5x +4


, Now that part of the equation has be multiplied you can handle the leftover binomial. In the example, (x+4)(x+1)(x+3), the leftover term was (x+3). Put it back along with the new equation, giving you: (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4).

, This is distribution of terms. So, for the equation (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4), you need to multiply the first x by the three parts of the second parenthesis, ""x2,"" ""5x,"" and ""4.""


(x * x2) + (x * 5x) + (x * 4) = x3 + 5x2 + 4x

Write this answer down and save it for later.

, Take the equation, (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4). Now, multiply the second part of the binomial by all three parts in the other parentheses, ""x2,"" ""5x,"" and ""4.""


(3 * x2) + (3 * 5x) + (3 * 4) = 3x2 + 15x + 12

Write this answer down next to the first answer.

, You need to combine the answers from the previous two steps, as they make up the two parts of your final answer.


x3 + 5x2 + 4x + 3x2 + 15x + 12

, Any ""like"" terms, terms that share the same variable and power (like 5x2 and 3x2), can be added together to make your answer simpler.


5x2 and 3x2 become 8x2

4x and 15x become 19x
(x+4)(x+1)(x+3) = x3 + 8x2 + 19x + 12


, Since you can use distribution of terms to multiply equations of any length, you now have the tools needed to solve larger problems, like (x+1)(x+2)(x+3). Multiply any two binomials together using either distribution of terms or FOIL, then use the distribution of terms to multiply the final binomial to the first two. In the following example, we FOIL (x+1)(x+2), then distribute the terms with (x+3) to get the final answer:


(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x+1)(x+2) * (x+3)
(x+1)(x+2) = x2 + 3x + 2
(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x2 + 3: + 2) * (x+3)
(x2 + 3x + 2) * (x+3) = x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 9x + 6

Simplify to final answer: x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6

Try to have fun while playing.,
Exert caution when playing with toys.,
Avoid giving your child toxic things to play with.,
Pick age-appropriate toys.,
Pick out toys that will allow your one to one-and-a-half year old to play pretend.,
Pick out larger toys as your child grows.",How to Have Fun with Your Toddler3," There are a myriad of activities and games that you can engage your toddler in. Make these games count and be sure that these activities are fun for her. Equally important is that you have fun too. Despite the fact that you have a lot going on, make sure that you are genuine when playing with your child; if you are bored, you child will be able to sense it.Remember that you are the ultimate playmate; your child will find any activity more fun and enjoyable when you are playing with her.
While playing, talk to your child about what she likes, her interests, and what she finds fun.

, Until your child is old enough to understand that toys are not for eating, make sure to buy toys that are larger than her mouth to prevent her from choking. Don’t pick toys with cords or strings that are longer than 12 inches (30.5 cm). These strings or cords could strangle your toddler.


Always supervise your child when she is playing with a new toy for the first time.

, You may not even realize that something, like a paintbrush, could pose a hazard. If that paint brush had come into contact with lead paint however, it could be a health threat. Read labels on toys and keep safety in mind when letting your child roam around you house and pick things up.


Generally steer clear of items with lead, mercury, arsenic and other chemicals.

, As a parent, you should try to be realistic about your child’s age and maturity; follow the “recommended age” sign written on the toy’s box. Toys with little parts cannot be given to children less than 8 or 10 years old because they might put these parts in their mouth, nose or ears.., Some of the toys that are well suited for toddlers 13 to 18 months of age are those that imitate life because kids love to pretend play. These toys might include:


Push and pull toys like wagons or cardboard boxes.
Stuffed animals.
Boxes and rings to stack.
Bouncy balls.

, Toddlers 19 to 24 months of age will show a bit more independence in their actions. Toys for your toddler at this time are basically still the same as when she was 18 months old, but can be bigger; this includes bigger blocks and bricks, or bigger balls alongside the smaller ones. These larger toys provide the opportunity to develop her perception skills. Other toys for this age group include:

Toy instruments.
Puzzles.
Art supplies.
Toys like train sets that can be linked together.

Consult with a doctor or registered dietitian.,
Make any changes to your diet slowly.,
Eat foods containing folate.,
Eat foods containing B12.,
Eat probiotics.,
Eat a balanced diet of fresh food.,
Eliminate processed and sugary foods.",How to Prevent Low Platelet Count3," Before you make any significant changes to your diet, even if you think your changes will be healthy, you should consult with your physician or a registered dietitian.Many health conditions and prescription medications must be taken into account when planning a diet plan, so consulting with a professional will keep you safe and healthy.
A registered dietitian is an expert who has completed education, training, and supervision in the field of nutrition. Dietitians can help you determine a healthy diet and fitness plan that will account for any health conditions you have and medications or supplements you take., Implementing changes to what you're eating on a daily basis in a gradual fashion will help your body adjust appropriately. Sometimes altering your diet can cause unpleasant symptoms as your body adjusts to the new foods and eliminates the remnants of the old foods.Making gradual changes will also ease any cravings you may feel for what you used to eat, such as sugary treats or salty snacks.

, Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin; folic acid and food folate are both sources of folate.Folate deficiency can cause your bone marrow to have difficulty making enough platelets.The recommended daily intake of folate varies, but adults should usually have between 400mcg and 600mcg a day. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here.Beef liver, leafy and dark green vegetables, legumes, fortified cereals, and nuts are good sources of folate., If you don't consume enough vitamin B12, your bone marrow may have difficulty making enough platelets.Vitamin B12 is also essential to red blood cell formation.The recommended daily intake of B12 varies, but adults should usually have between 2.4mcg and 2.8mcg daily. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here.
B12 is commonly found in animal products, so vegetarians and vegans may need a supplement. Good dietary sources of B12 include shellfish, beef liver, fish, fortified cereals, and dairy products., Foods containing probiotics, such as yogurt and fermented foods, may help improve the immune system.Probiotic bacteria may also help regulate the immune system, which may help people with autoimmune disorders (a common cause of low platelet count).Good sources of probiotics include yogurt with live cultures, kefir (fermented milk), kimchi (Korean fermented vegetables), and fermented soy products such as tempeh, miso, and natto., Eat a wide variety of foods, particularly different fruits and vegetables. Eating widely will help your body get all of the nutrients it needs. In addition, try to eat locally; buy produce when it's in season in your local area. Not only will you be getting the freshest produce, but there's also less chance it has any additives or pesticides in order to keep it fresh for transport across long distances.Visit the grocery store often to shop for fresh produce because the nutrient content decreases with time. Instead of doing all of your shopping on one day, plan to go to the store a few times per week.
Always choose fresh varieties over frozen and canned foods. For example, if you have the choice between fresh corn on the cob and canned corn, go for the fresh.

, Replace these foods with whole, unprocessed food. For example, eat whole grain cereals, brown rice, and whole wheat products. Again, read the labels of products as you shop. Reduce the amount of white flour, white rice and processed foods you consume because these have been and ""refined"", or stripped of their nutrient-rich coating.


Be sure as well to reduce the amount of white sugar you consume, as well as other sweeteners, such as fructose, corn syrup and honey. Cut back as well on fruits with lots of sugar, including mangoes, cherries, and grapes, as well as sugary fruit juices.Sugar can contribute to promoting high levels of acidity in the body.

Aloe cream is readily available at most pharmacies and drug stores. Keep a bottle at your desk or, if you drive a lot for work, in your car. Apply it regularly – it’s safe to use often.Keep a small bottle in your purse or briefcase if you’re often on the move.;
, You may find that you prefer a traditional moisturizer over aloe. Any heavy cream or ointment moisturizer can help you manage itch at work. Keep a container readily available and apply it as regularly as you’d like.Use moisturizer with an SPF of at least 15 if you work outdoors.

, Cold baths and ice packs can help alleviate itch from psoriasis. Since you probably can’t shower at work, keep a cold pack in your office refrigerator. Use it at your desk if you start to itch.Be courteous to your coworkers by keeping your cold pack in a bag, so it isn’t touching food.
If you work outside or on the move, use a chilled lunchbox to carry a cold pack with you.

, Whether you use calamine lotion, hydrocortisone, camphor, or a prescription itch-relief medication, keep a spare bottle at the office or in your car.Ask your doctor for a spare prescription so you can have an extra bottle on hand.


If you take oral medication, know which medicines cause drowsiness and don’t use them at work.

, If you feel particularly self-conscious one day, simply cover up whatever problem areas you can. Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, or long skirts to cover your neck, arms, and legs. Use a colorful scarf or accessorize with gloves if you have plaques on your hands or neck., Body makeup and concealer can help to mask the redness and scaly skin of psoriasis plaques. These shouldn’t be used all the time because they can irritate your skin, but you can use them some days if it makes you feel better emotionally.Ask your doctor or pharmacist about what types of products you should avoid. Don’t use makeup on open cuts or sores. Always do a patch test on a small area of skin to make sure you don’t react to it.There is an art to covering rough, uneven skin with makeup. Ask a professional at a makeup counter for tips!

, The red patches caused by psoriasis are sites of inflammation. To relieve your symptoms, take measures to reduce and prevent inflammation in your body.


Exercise can reduce inflammation and stiffness. Outside of work, try incorporating exercises like walking, swimming, and yoga into your life.At work, aim to stand and walk around at least once an hour.

An anti-inflammatory diet, in which you eat foods known to reduce inflammation, may help provide relief. Leafy greens, fruit, and foods with Omega-3s like olive oil may all help.Ask your doctor about taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or a prescription drug. These can relieve inflammation and pain.

Take your parrot to a veterinarian.,
Give your parrot antibiotics for the bacterial infection.,
Treat any secondary infections.,
Follow your veterinarian's directions for continued treatment.",How to Treat Parrots for Bacterial Infections1," If you suspect that your bird has a bacterial infection then it should be assessed and treated by a veterinarian. Your vet will likely have a conversation with you about the symptoms you have noticed, assess the bird's physical condition, and then run any necessary tests that will give him or her enough information to give a diagnosis and treatment plan.


It is best to take your bird to a veterinarian that is experienced with treating exotic birds. They will have the knowledge to properly assess, diagnose, and treat your pet.
However, aviary veterinarians, as they are sometimes known, are not always available in every area. This means that you should try to find one before you have an emergency situation and need to find one in a hurry.;
, Most bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. While there are problems with over-prescribing antibiotics for infections, which can lead to antibiotic-resistant strains developing, serious bacterial infections often require treatment with antibiotics in order to be eliminated.


Your vet will determine the type of antibiotic that needs to be used by assessing the type of bacterial infection, the severity of the infection, the location of the infection, and the sensitivity of your bird., Bacterial infections can take hold in your bird because it has another infection that is weakening its immune system. If this is the case, the additional infection needs to be eliminated in order for your bird to fully recover and be healthy.


Keeping infections at bay also requires that you keep your bird's area clean and tidy. Clean your bird's cage regularly and focus on good husbandry, such as avoiding overcrowding, when caring for a sick bird., Treatment length and type will vary depending on the type and severity of infection your parrot has. However, most serious bacterial infections will require continued treatment with an antibiotic after the bird is released from veterinary care.In the case of chlamydiosis, an infection that affects parrots, treatment with antibiotics usually lasts for several weeks.
In the case of mycobacteriosis, which is avian tuberculosis, treatment may be required for six months to a year before the condition is cleared up.

Make your tools.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Create your crafting stations.",How to Heal in Don't Starve1," You’ll need a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials for this venture. They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.

To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down and create the gatherable supplies.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs since they’re vital for creating a Science Machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also for other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also important for campfires and torches.

Rocks can be found scattered everywhere, much like flint, but are less common and are more abundantly found from mining boulders.
Everything initially gathered, save for Logs, can stack up to 40 per inventory slot. Logs, being heavier, stack up to 20.

, Aside from the Science Machine, you’ll also be needing an Alchemy Engine to create your supplies. Both can be created through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, but you’ll need a Science Machine to make an Alchemy Engine.

A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and an Alchemy Engine costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon.
You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Before you craft a Science Machine, make sure that you’ll be camping there permanently. Once you place the Science Machine, it cannot be moved. The Alchemy Engine is also a permanent structure and cannot be moved around.

Conduct interviews.,
Run focus-groups.,
Use feedback cards.,
Consider mystery shopping.",How to Measure Customer Satisfaction3," Interviews give you a great opportunity to mine the customer's experience and perception of your business. They enable you go further than answers with fixed, discreet answers. The format used can vary greatly, but the one of the advantages it gives you is the possibility to use follow-up questions in order to clarify any uncertain remarks.Interviews can be conducted over the phone or in person, to a script or more free-form.
The kind of data you get will depend on the style and format, as well as actual content of the interviews.
A skilled interviewer will most likely be able to gain a lot more useful information than someone who is reading from a script.
Interviews produce the most in-depth information, but are the most expensive way to gather data., Focus-groups can be a good way to get relatively informal information from a number of your customers. It has the benefits of a face-to-face interview in that you can gauge the reaction of somebody, and there is ample opportunity for follow-up questions. Unlike an individual interview, a focus-group enables a group dynamic to develop, which can have positive and negative consequences.


You may discover more about perceptions of your business as the members of the group react to each other's remarks.
This can highlight disagreements as well as agreements, and expose how different people can respond to the same thing in different ways.
Aim for small groups of 5-10 people, and record what is said.
You might consider hiring a specialist to conduct the focus-group, or do it yourself., Feedback cards can be a cheap and low-maintenance way to conduct regular research on customer satisfaction. You can leave them out around your business, or hand them out directly to customers. They don't take long to complete and can be analysed quickly.

On the down-side, the information you receive will most likely be very limited, and you won't have to opportunity follow-up.
Often feedback cards are treated as an afterthought, with generic questions.
They will give customers an opportunity to make a complaint anonymously and quietly, which can highlight problems that would not otherwise have come to light.

, Mystery shopping is another way to get feedback on the performance of staff, and the service your business is offering to customers. Mystery shopping may be done in person in the store, over the phone, or over the internet. A person unknown to you will be hired to act as a normal customer and then document the experience.


Mystery shopping can help you see from a customers-eye-view, and negate the possible biases that managers and supervisors might have about particular teams or employees.
The results are, however, somewhat dependant on the professionalism and effectiveness of the mystery shopper."

Decide what you want to do.,
Learn how to use your auras effectively.,
Educate yourself on all your Seal and Judgment spells.",How to Make Your Paladin Powerful," If your guild needs you to specialize in healing, then start procuring plate spellcaster gear. It is completely up to you on how you want to spend your talent points, but it would be a good idea to look up profiles of experienced Paladins in wowhead.com's profiler tool. Here are the talent builds and what they can do:

Holy (Healing) The paladin is best known for being manna efficient when healing and they make great single-target healers. There is a talent that when your healing spells critically strike, you get 60% of the mana you just used back. So paladins should focus on + crit gear if planning to heal, besides the + intellect and + spell power that all casters need. On the down side, they have no healing over time spells. Even without, they are very good healers. Paladins can wear any armor type, so if you are planning on healing and won't be getting hit much, it is OK to use cloth/leather/mail armor as long as its' stats are suitable. Paladins cannot equip staffs so you are going to have to use a 1 handed sword/mace and a shield. Another reason Paladins are good healers is because they can't be one hit by bosses since they are wearing plate armour have a shield equipped.



 


Protection (Tank) You are wearing plate remember? Paladins are also great tanks and specialize in holding aggro with several enemies at once with their Consecration. Although their Holy Shield spell is not guaranteed to block all attacks like the Warrior's Shield Block, it has a shorter cool down to be used more often. The Paladin's threat is based on Holy damage done, so it helps to get some + spell damage gear along with your + defense. Also one of the great talents a Paladin gets as protection is when they are below 35% health, they will take 30% less damage. To open up on a pull, use Avengers Shield and as soon as the enemies get close enough,Consecrate. Aggro should be on you from now on and all you have to do is not die. And make sure your Righteous Fury is activated






Retribution (DPS) Paladin's damage is physical and spell based, but don't be confused. The stats you want to stack are Attack Power (AP) and Crit Chance. AP is seen as spell power when spells are used. Almost all of your damage abilities are instant cast and based on weapon damage. You will want to pick a two-handed weapon (2H) that has a slow attack speed because the slower the attack speed, the harder it hits for each hit. Don't waste time on +Haste gear because haste doesn't affect instant casts in any way. Paladins also specialize in damaging Undead and Demons and they have a few spells that damage only those types of enemies. Always judge the target you are trying to kill. If specified into Retribution, your judgments will increase the crit chance on that target for everyone.





;
, Paladins have a variety of auras that effect all group members such as Devotion aura, which increases armor by about 1200 or so at level 80. They also have some great buffs called ""Blessings"" such as Blessing of Kings which increases all stats by 10%. That's really beneficial to tanks because it will increase there hit points by about 2000 depending on their gear level.

, Seals are something every Paladin has the ability to use. In fact almost everything a Paladin does is based on the Seals used. Read each one and decide what you want to use, keep in mind there is another side to seals: Judgments. Whatever seal you are using at the time has a judgment effect that applies when you use the Judgment ability. Judgments are a major source of your DPS and always help the group in some way. For example Judgment of Light has a chance to heal anyone who attacks that enemy for a small amount. There are three different Judgement spells: Judgement of Light, Judgement of Wisdom, which can restore 2% of the attackers mana, and Judgement of Justice which limits an enemies movement speed.

Be a leader, not a follower.,
Get help.",How to Stop Eating Ice Cream4," Have you ever sat down to a movie with a pint of Ben and Jerry's, and before the opening credits have ended, you've finished the whole container without even realizing it? This is called “unconscious eating” and it’s very common. It happens when we simply are not aware that we’re eating.Think about the food you put in your mouth, including not allowing yourself to take another bite until you’ve swallowed the existing mouthful.Savor each bite - which will also slow down your eating.
Don't eat ice cream while you're engaging in other enjoyable activities (like watching a movie or surfing the internet). Instead, savor the moment itself, and let the joy of the activity be enough.
Before putting one spoonful of ice cream in your mouth, ask yourself these two questions: If I eat this ice cream, will I feel like I lost control? If I eat this ice cream, will I feel shame, blame or guilt? If you answer yes to one or both of these questions, put that ice cream aside and have something else., One of the many reasons we crave foods like ice cream is because it makes us feel better. But one of the reasons we want to feel better is because we don’t allow ourselves to truly experience our emotions.Rather than trying to ignore or push aside what we’re feeling, allow yourself to feel the emotions. Cry if you have to. Talk to someone about what you’re feeling. Write down your feelings in a journal. Allow yourself to experience emotions rather than comfort yourself with ice cream.

, While it is sometimes used as a mean joke or a stereotype, it is true that some women might crave ice cream during the few days leading up to their period, as a part of a cluster of symptoms known as premenstrual syndrome. Recognizing the correlation between your ice cream consumption and menstrual cycle can save you from being a slave to ice cream during those days.


Eat something else. The truth is, most women burn up to 15% more calories during their period, as the body works hard to cleanse the womb and prepare for another month.It is normal to feel hungrier during this time, since you need more calories. Instead of wasting the calories on sugar and fat in ice cream, eat something more nutritious like frozen yogurt, a smoothie, or a glass of chocolate milk. Those things will satisfy your craving for something cold and sweet but provide more nutritional bang for the buck.
Don't keep it in the house leading up to your period. If you know you typically crave it, don't buy it in advance, so that it will be harder to access when you find yourself wanting it.
Think of other ways to soothe your body and emotions during PMS: a hot bath, a good book, or even a small glass of wine can be preferable to a pint of chocolate ice cream.

, Don’t feel the need to order that ice cream for dessert just because everyone else at the table is ordering ice cream for dessert! It doesn’t matter what they think about you. Do what you want to do, not what everyone else is doing., If you’ve tried other methods of eliminating ice cream from your diet, but none of them have worked, consider the possibility that you might need to get some expert help. You might want to reach out to a doctor, therapist, and/or a registered dietitian for help.A counselor or doctor can help you identify the root causes of your addiction, and set you up with a personalized plan to eliminate the problem.
If you do have a food addiction, remember that food manufacturers purposely make food, like ice cream, with a combination of ingredients that creates feelings of pleasure and satisfactionObviously they want to sell and re-sell their product as often as possible, so they create a product that people will crave.

Open with explaining the framework of a letter.,
Review examples.,
Break it down.,
Bring it all back together.",How to Teach Letter Writing4," With all your planning complete, it is time to commence teaching. Opening the lesson/s with the basic framework of a letter will enable student to see the skeleton of a letter and then work can commence on filling in the body.


Start by covering the basic bones of a letter, the opening salutations, the introduction to a letter setting the scene on the purposes of the letter.
Then show the body of a letter communicating the intended information
Finally, explain the conclusion, which wraps up the letter.
It is also important to discuss the many varied types of writing a letter possible and which type can be used for which purpose. Also explain how a student can identify the right style of writing to suit the purpose of the letter. This could be an excellent opportunity for a quiz to be inserted on knowing which style of letter is appropriate for a particular occasion.

, Once the skeleton of letter writing has been established with students, demonstrate the application of that framework by using examples of letter writing and identifying in each where each bone of the skeleton is. Show the different styles of writing using sample letters, including famous writers where possible. Using examples will help the theoretical concepts you have just taught to stick in the students' memories.

, Once the examples are completed, break up the concepts and teach them one by one.


Talk about opening salutations and the various material that comes with this. Have students practice writing one or several different types to understand in their own minds what you are speaking about.
Repeat the same structure for the introduction or scene setting opening lines, the body of the letter and the conclusion.

, When you have finished breaking down the different components and covered the vast material on each part of the letter, bring those bones all back together to form a whole. This would be an ideal time to have the student practice writing a whole letter in a context. And, if time permits, repeat the activity in a different context to help students adjust to the various types and times in their lives they will interact with letters.

Blanket Clip.,
Hunter Clip.,
Full Clip.",How to Clip Your Horse1," For this clip, you remove the hair from just the underside of the neck and belly. This is common on ponies living out and only ridden on the weekends. Hardy ponies may not need to be rugged with this clip, unless the weather is very bad.;
, Hair is clipped from the underside of the neck and belly up to where the traces would be on a driving pony. As the name suggests, high trace clips remove the coat up to a higher line than the low trace clip. The lower half of the head is also sometimes clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This clip is appropriate for horses who are turned out during the day, and perform moderate work on a regular basis.

, A line is draw from the poll (top of the head) to the belly to make a triangle shape, everything under this is clipped. Often half the head is also clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This is done on horses who perform light work and are turned out during the day.

, This is similar to a trace clip, but the neck is fully clipped and the head is half or full clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This is good for horses that work heavily, as it removes hair where they sweat but leaves enough to keep them warm simultaneously.

, All the hair is removed, except from the legs to give some protection. Some hair is sometimes left on the back in the shape of the saddle, and less often girth, to give protection from saddle rubs. Because most of the hair is removed with this clip, careful watch must be taken to make sure that the horse does not become too cold.

, For this clip, the entire coat is clipped off. This is done on show horses who are heavily involved in competition, to give them a sleek coat that sweat can evaporate off of easily. A full clip should only be done if the horse is not turned out during the winter or at night."

Feel for tenderness over your spleen.",How to Differentiate Bacterial Tonsillitis and Viral Tonsillitis1," If a virus causes your tonsillitis, you’re more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. A general feeling of being unwell and a fever can occur with either viral or bacterial infection, but the fever is usually lower if you have a virus – closer to 100.4°F (38°C) than 102°F (38.9°C)., You may have a cough with either cause, but a cough and a husky voice are more commonly associated with viral illness. Coughing and voice changes can be caused by laryngitis, usually a viral ailment that goes along with tonsillitis., Tonsillitis caused by a virus usually goes away or at least begins to improve within three to four days, so if you start to feel better after that time you likely have a passing viral infection. Bacterial tonsillitis can last much longer, or even until medically treated.See your doctor if you see no improvement in symptoms after four days — you may have a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.
Even viral tonsillitis can last up to two weeks, so a longer illness isn’t a definite sign of a bacterial infection., EBV is the usual cause of mononucleosis, or “mono.” Mono is a common cause of tonsillitis in young adults and teens. Mono can last for weeks, and is often associated with fatigue, sore throat and tonsillitis, fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, and headache.Mono will pass on its own and usually doesn’t require treatment, but you should still get diagnosed. This can be done with a simple blood test.

, Some people with mono also get a pinpoint red, speckled rash on the roof of their mouth. Open wide and look at the top of your mouth in a mirror. Red speckles can indicate mono.Mono can occur with or without a skin rash, too.
While looking in your mouth, also check for a gray membrane covering your tonsils. This is another sign of mono., Gently feel over the area of your spleen — under your ribcage, above your stomach, on the left side of your torso. Your spleen may enlarge if you have mono and feel tender when pressed. Be gentle! A swollen spleen can rupture if handled roughly."

If you are serious about selling your script.",How to Write a Feature Film Script," or, preferably, find a story that you love. This is going to be a process that will seem difficult or insurmountable at times, so it better be about something you don’t mind thinking and/or agonizing about for several months. Research your particular genre, and stay with in the rules of that genre, if you are looking to sell your script. The film industry is always looking for marketability over originality. That's not saying a little originality is a bad thing.;
, Not getting it will only annoy you and potential readers who are used to seeing dialog placed at an exact four inches from either side of the margin. If you can’t afford Movie Magic or Final Draft or Montage, try “Celtx”. Stick three “w’s” and a “.com” to the name and you’re golden. I am starting to use it now. It is pretty much fully functional and adds the option of putting your scripts in an online database for collaboration and sharing. Who knows? Maybe that is the next big thing.

, Write a short sentence (15 words or less) of the fundamental concept which drives the plot. It will help you to identify if your film is too complex and seek feedback.

, It is easy to get lost over the course of one hundred pages. Seek feedback.

, Even more than a plot outline, characters can make or break your story. List the characters and give a complete description of them, physically and characteristics like if they are smart, good and likeable or, as it tends to be these days, if they are dumb, evil and hateful but in a likeable way (see Richard III by W. Shakespeare for ideas) then you have got yourself a movie. If they are the same people you have seen again and again and have been bored with yourself at the movie theater, keep thinking. If your protagonists and antagonists are characters, make sure you list out their flaws. During the course of the story the protagonist overcomes his/her/their flaws and the antagonist flaws becomes his/her/their downfall.

, Yeah, so a lot of established writers have done away with it and done well but that is because they are established writers. Producers are willing to take chances on them because they have made money before. Most movies are written in the format of The Hero's Journey, which there are a number of articles on the web relating to The Hero's Journey. Another good reference is The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler and Story by Robert McKee

, If you have no idea what the last step was about…learn it. Here it is, in the briefest of brief forms: ACT I tells us about a world and characters as they are meant to be, and introduces a problem they need to solve. For example, “The Goonies live their lives happily in their little section of the world, until they discover that developers want to turn the goon docks into condominiums, so…” ACT II develops the characters more and deals with the problem. For example, “So, the Goonies enter One-Eyed Willy’s maze and try to get through all the traps in order to…” In ACT III, several things happen, probably the most important being that the hero, early on in this part, gets to a point where he or she is ready to give up. BUT and this is the important part: he or she is somehow given the idea that giving up is not the answer and instead figures out a way to win the day. For example, “Sean Astin, in Goonies, figures out a way to turn One-Eyed Willy’s traps against the villains and instead manages to get enough jewels to save the Goon docks.”

, Dialogue is best written after you have written the rest of the script, this way it makes sure that your story is told visually. Keep dialogue short, simple and make sure it is not on the nose. If you are struggling you could improvise it in a # reheasal.

, Remember each page is roughly equivalent to a minute in film time. Write action and describe how something feels instead of writing description. And finally and most importantly, keep it simple and easy to read.

, This will give you the general flow of the scripts and make it easier to tell where the story is moving.

, Make sure your dialog is very colloquial (characteristic of or appropriate to ordinary or familiar conversation rather than formal speech or writing). An exercise in helping write colloquial is to eavesdrop on someone else's conversation and record it word for word.

, Not even close. Once you have written a first draft, go back and revise the heck out of it. If, at this point, you have written one hundred and twenty pages, then you have probably written at least thirty pages too many. Go back and start cutting things out, simplifying characters, and making it a tighter, easier to read package.

, Until you feel it is finished.

, Send the script away to a respectable script reading service. For a fee, they can send you critical information on what parts of the script need improvements and much more.

Turn off the power.,
Confirm the space is free.,
Locate the same spot from above or below.,

Drop a string from above instead.,
Draw the wire along with a magnet.,
Approach lath and plaster construction with caution.,
Drill through fire blocks.,
Thread wires past insulation.,
Cut through drywall for horizontal fishing.,
Drill through studs or joists as a last resort.,
Seal holes in fire blocks with fire-resistant caulk (recommended).",How to Fish Wires Through Walls," Shut off the electricity to the circuit you are modifying. Double check with a multimeter at the closest outlet where you plan to connect the wires., Check for studs at the location where you want the wire to exit. Confirm there are no cross beams or duct work along the path the wire will take (typically straight up to the attic, or straight down to the basement). Ideally, use a stud finder that can tell the difference between studs, pipes, and other obstacles.Failing that, locate studs with magnets, or knock on the wall listening for hollow sounds.


If there is any uncertainty, drill a small test hole and explore with a bent wire coat hanger.
Avoid locations with another electrical outlet less than two studs away. Stay away from exterior walls, which typically contain braces and insulation., Check the attic, basement, and/or crawlspace to confirm you have a clear path to thread the wire. You can often find a 2 x 4 or larger beam (the top or bottom plate) running along the wall, and measure along it to find the correct spot. If there is no beam, locate the wall using one of these methods:Look for a row of nails in the subfloor, or a pair of joists very close together.Find a feature visible from both sides, such as a vent. Measure from there to the location you chose, then measure the same distance on the other floor.
If all else fails, drill a small test hole from the main floor to the attic or basement. Thread a pipe cleaner or similar object through and locate it on the other side., Return to the main floor and cut out a piece of drywall where the wire will exit:If installing an electrical box, trace the outline onto the drywall to get the exact dimensions. Otherwise, just draw a rectangle.
Drill two holes in opposite corners of the rectangle.
Slowly cut along the outline from one hole to the other, using a manual drywall saw.
If you need to patch the hole afterward, cut at an inward slant and remove in one piece.

, Return to the attic or basement, and drill through the wall plate where you want to guide the wire through. You may encounter nails, so choose a drill bit that won't get damaged by metal.If you're working in a crawlspace, you can use a flex bit drill to drill this hole from several feet away.
Keep the hole at least 1¼"" from the edge of the wood.If this does not allow for a hole large enough to insert your wires, separate the wires and insert them through separate, smaller holes, spaced a reasonable distance apart.

, Carefully extend the fish tape from one opening to the other. Tape the end of the fish tape onto the cable with electrical tape. Retract the fish tape to pull the cable through.


Move slowly to avoid snagging the cable or damaging it due to kinks or friction., If you want to bring the wire up to the attic, tie something to a string and lower it through the hole from above. Once the string reaches the bottom, go down to the lower opening and tie the cable and string together. Pull the string from above to fish the wire through.

, A magnet may be the most effective method for long vertical distances or tricky corners. The key is to place the magnet at the stationary end, so it does not attach itself to a metal object in the middle of your wall:Tape a powerful magnet (such as a rare earth magnet) onto the end of the cable.
Stick the magnet and cable through one opening.
Tie an iron nail or similar object to a fish tape (or a string if the fish tape is not long enough).
Lower the nail on the fish tape through the other opening, until it makes contact with the magnet.
Remove the magnet and attach the cable end to the fish tape using electrical tape.
Retract the fish tape up to thread the cable through.

, Old plaster tends to break off the wooden lath easily, which makes installation much more difficult. If possible, mount electrical boxes next to a joist for a sturdier support.Be prepared to repair the plaster after installation.

, If there are horizontal fire blocks between studs, you have two options:Use a flex bit to drill through the center of the fire block.

Or cut through the drywall at the fire block, and chisel out a notch ¾-inch wide x 1-inch deep (1.9 x 2.5 cm). Cover the notch with a metal nail plate after pulling the cable through.

, If the wall contains insulation, try to fish the wire between the outer paper or plastic cover and the wall. If there is no cover, press the wire against a stud and use it as a guide.While handling fiberglass insulation, wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask that covers your mouth and nose., If there is no way to avoid fishing your wire horizontally, you will likely need to cut through the drywall. A small cut with a penknife is usually enough to let you guide the wire through.In most cases, you will also need to drill through a wall stud as described below.

, If there is no open path for the wire, you may need to drill through wall studs or ceiling joists. Follow these guidelines to avoid causing structural damage:Wall stud: drill through the center of the stud, using a maximum diameter of 60% of the stud's width (40% for load-bearing walls).
Ceiling joist: center the hole vertically, not through the top or bottom 2"" (5 cm). Avoid the ends of the joist as well as the middle third. Maximum diameter is ⅓ of the actual depth of the joist (not the depth as labeled).
Vital support structures: Never drill through ""glue lams"" (laminated support beams), or through supports above doors, windows, or arches.

, Wiring through unprotected holes can allow a fire to spread rapidly between floors of your house. If you drilled through a fire block in your wall, or through fire-resistant flooring material, seal up the holes with fire-resistant caulk or a similar product."

Wrap bouquets in gold.,
Choose gold accessories.,
Try on gold shoes.",How to Add Gold to Your Wedding Decor4," You can ask your florist to do this while making your bouquets, or you can do it yourself with gold ribbon and pins. Wrap the stems of your bouquets in gold to add a little sparkle to your flowers and your look while coming down the aisle.If possible, try to talk to your florist in advance to see what your options are for adding gold to your bouquet wrapping. This saves you the hassle of having to redo things later on.

, Add some gold to your look by adding gold accessories. For brides, this could mean gold necklaces, bracelets, earrings, hair clips and pins, and even sashes or belts around the wedding dress. For grooms, this may mean cufflinks, watches, or belts.


You can opt for genuine gold accessories, or for more affordable novelty and costume jewelry that is gold plated or gold colored.
If you are wearing diamonds, pearls, or other stones, look for jewels in a gold setting.

, Gold shoes can add a bit of gold to the outfit for brides, grooms, bridesmaids, and groomsmen. Gold heels or ballet flats work for the more traditional bridal look, while gold sneakers or high tops work for both men and women at unconventional or casual weddings.Search local shoe stores for your gold shoe options, as well as online marketplaces.
You can also dye white cotton or satin shoes a gold color to match the rest of your decor. Canvas shoes can even be painted gold.

Make plans.",How to Get a Friend Back," There is most likely a specific reason for the rift in your friendship. Consider the situation as objectively as you can. Does one of you bear a larger portion of involvement?


Even if you feel wronged by your friend, consider the possibility that somewhere along the line you have also hurt them in subtle ways that you weren't aware of.
On the other hand, if you know you're the one who made a mistake, spend some time reflecting on what you did and why, and how you can prevent doing it again.;
, If there seems to be no clear reason for your friend's distance, don't jump to conclusions. It may have nothing to do with you; your friend might have something troubling them., You may want your friend back, but until you're ready to acknowledge your own mistakes and/or forgive your friend theirs, you won't get anywhere.


That said, you may need to have a long talk with your friend before the wounds start to heal. The important thing is to make sure you feel ready and willing to put things back together, rather than nurse a grudge.

, If you feel you need to apologize, be specific about what you're apologizing for. Make sure it's sincere: what are you really sorry about?For example, if you've been ignoring your friend because you're spending all your time with a new love interest, it isn't appropriate to apologize for spending time with this other person. Instead, talk about how you're sorry you haven't been making time for your friend.

, It's probably best to talk in person if you can: body language can communicate a lot more than just your voices and may help avoid misunderstandings. However, if that's not possible, call your friend to talk.


If you ask to meet, try to avoid vague phrases like, ""We need to talk."" These can put your friend on the defensive. Instead, try a more emotionally rooted approach like, ""I miss you,"" or ""I was just hoping we could spend a little time together."", If you're too shy or your friend won't see you, writing a short note can help break down the barrier. Sometimes expressing yourself on paper is easier than in person. Try to be simple and straightforward; at the end, suggest a casual, no-pressure meeting, such as going for coffee or a walk.

, Tell your friend how important they are to you, and that you miss them. While it may be tempting to get this talk over with as soon as possible, cutting corners could work against you. This is the opportunity to wear your heart on your sleeve.


Again, avoid one-liners like, ""Let's bury the hatchet"" - such contrived phrases might put your friend on guard., Again, it's best if you approach the conversation without preconceived notions of how they're feeling or what they're going to say. Keep an open mind, and give them as long as they need to say whatever it is they need to.They may need a cue from you, like ""I'm sure I made you feel pretty awful,"" or ""I'd love to be friends again. Do you think that's possible?""Listen without interrupting, even if what they say triggers certain responses in you.

, You may have been ready to talk things through, but perhaps your friend wasn't quite. Both of you might need time to process what the other has said. You've made a big, important step initiating this talk - now step back a bit so your friend can consider.


This is especially important to keep in mind if you don't receive a positive response at first. In a few weeks or months, your friend may still come around., Your friend may need time, even more time than you expected, to mull things over. Friendships are complex, so don't expect this to mend overnight., If you are both ready to resume your friendship, this transition is a good moment to agree on a few basic things if necessary. This is also a chance for both of you to learn and grow from each other.


For example, maybe you'll agree to be a better listener and your friend will agree not criticize you so much.This doesn't mean, however, that you should make drastic changes to yourself to please your friend. If your friend makes demands you're uncomfortable with, you need to consider whether this is really a healthy friendship based on love and mutual respect.

, When you feel you've both talked everything through and things are on the mend, make a plan to see each other again. Suggesting a fun activity that you used to do together (going for a hike, making dinner, going to a movie) prevents dwelling on the problem and can help get your relationship back on track."

Set a specific training goal to work towards.,
Alternate easy and hard runs to build strength rapidly.,
Focus on explosive stride power through plyometrics.,
Aim for one to two sprint workouts a week to gain speed and power.,
Train your abs and core to ensure strong, efficient posture.,
Eat and hydrate like a professional athlete all week, not just the days you're running.,
Review and improve on your training schedule as you get stronger.",How to Improve Your Running1," Having a goal to work for beyond ""be a better runner"" allows you to tailor your workouts for maximum improvement. Whether you want to run your first 5K, make the cross country team, or cut 10 seconds off of your mile time, think about why you really want to improve. You can then plan accordingly.If you want to start racing, or simply want to make running a more regular habit, consider signing up for a local race. This gives you a concrete date and distance to train for.
If you're trying to make a team or be a better runner for sports, look online for common or recommended workouts for your specific activity, adding it to the advice here.
If you're looking to shave precious seconds off your time, know that you'll need to focus a bit more on strength and power training as well as regular running.;
, It is common for runners to push themselves about the same amount each time, running similarly challenging runs and gradually increasing difficulty. Elite runners, however, alternate an easy, resting run with a very challenge one. It is during these difficult runs, when you really push yourself, that your body makes the most significant gains.Don't feel like an easy day is ""cheating."" Rather, it is helping rebuild and relax the muscles needed for your big runs.
Vary your running routes — even running your normal route backward will provide a new challenge., Every time you run hard, you stretch your quads and hamstrings near their breaking point for a split second. Your body reacts by contracting the muscles quickly to give you power and protection. Plyometrics, which focus on quick, explosive movement, train the body to handle this stress and keep you strong and powerful throughout the run. These exercises are great after a light run, too. Twice a week, do at least 30 minutes of:Try:


Box jumps (use both legs, as well as each leg individually)
Shuttle runs
Single leg hops/leaps
Squat leaps — simply do squat without weight, then jump up and to the side instead of coming straight up
Power skips — how high you can get on each leap?, Sprint workouts aren't just about being a faster sprinter -- the high-energy, powerful steps used at your top speed will help train your muscles to better handle stress at any pace.Some training suggestions include:



Interval Running: Jog lightly for five to 10 minutes. Immediately after, sprint for 30 seconds. Jog for 60 seconds, then sprint for another 30, repeating five to six more times. Jog for five to 10 minutes to cool down.

Ladders: This requires a track or other way to do laps. Jog lightly for five to 10 minutes. When done, sprint a lap at almost 90% top speed. Jog a lap to rest and recover. When done, sprint two laps and jog another lap to recover. Keep escalating the sprint laps until you can no longer push yourself, then jog to cool down for five to 10 minutes., Your core helps transfer energy smoothly from your upper half to lower half. Even more importantly, it helps you stay upright and strong when tired, which helps conserve vital energy. Never neglect your core during training. While not directly felt, strong abs and obliques will lead to more efficient, and thus improved, running.



Crunches and sit-ups, either straight or to the sides.

Planks and other ""hold"" exercises are excellent for building posture and stamina.
Abs can be done every day, or you can choose two to three days a week to do harder and more focused workouts., One of the biggest myths in exercise is that you can ""eat whatever you want"" just because you're running a lot. But you can only burn about 30% of the calories you eat through exercise.Furthermore, the types of calories you consume directly impact how successfully you can run. While dieting properly is it's own topic, some things to remember include to:


Prioritize food that comes from seeds, fruits and vegetables, as they come pre-packed with essential nutrients.
Drink water all day, keeping hydrated before you start running. You want to stay ahead of feeling thirsty, not just drinking once you're parched.
Lean towards lean proteins like chicken, fish, and beans instead of fattier red meats and greasier meats like sausage.
Replace ""empty"" snacks like cookies and candies with vegetables, hummus, yogurt, and low-cal alternatives like pretzels or baked chips.
Recognize that big, heavy, and unhealthy meals can take two to three days to get through your body. Plan before big runs or races accordingly., The better you get, the harder you'll need to push yourself. A good benchmark for any training plan is to ask, ""How hard are the last five to 10 minutes?"" You make the greatest gains when you push through difficulties, so make sure your workouts are still challenging you in order to keep improving.


Working with a partner is often a good way to keep challenging yourself and find motivation to keep working.
Give yourself bigger and harder benchmarks. If you feel good, add a mile to your toughest run, or start incorporating more hills instead of flats.

Opt for a colorful dish soap.,
Fill a Ziploc bag with dish soap.,
Freeze the bag overnight.",How to Make an Ice Gel Pack2," Colorful dish soap is less likely to freeze all the way. It is also harder to mistake colorful dish soap for something edible in the freezer. If you want your gel pack to look like a traditional gel pack, you may want to opt for blue dish soap., You can fill the bag as full as you want it with dish soap. There is no set amount. Simply fill the bag until your ice pack is as big and bulky as you want it.Keep in mind more dish soap can cause a bag to take longer to freeze. If you need your ice pack very soon, opt to use less dish soap.

, Place your bag in the refrigerator. Allow it to freeze overnight. When you take the gel pack out of the fridge, it should be semi-frozen and ready to use on sore areas of your body."

There are over 250 different templates available.



If you have Word 2007 or later, start a new document and select ""Resumes and CVs"" from the list of document styles. You'll be able to browse between various options and download the template of your choice.

If you have an earlier version of Word, search the templates online and select the template of your choice. You can choose between templates for particular goals or careers, or a variety of basic templates.;
, There are many pages of templates, so take your time and find the right one. You can also look for specific resume types in the search field at the top of the page. You'll have the choice between the following template styles:



Basic resume templates feature simple design and basic categories of information applicable to many different career fields, and are the most useful for entry-level employees. Select the""Entry-Level Resume"" if you're just getting started or are a recent graduate, which will highlight other experience, skills, and education over previous employment.

Job-specific templates are organized to focus on specific career-centered information and experiences that wouldn't be included on other types of resumes. An academics resume, for instance, would likely have a section for teaching experience and publications, while a driver's would likely have a section for particular vehicle class certifications.

Situation-specific templates refer to different organizations of information, which may be appropriate for highlighting experience and or complicated work histories. A chronologically-organized resume, for example, would organize your recent job history in order, rather than into different categories. This is a good choice if you're switching careers.

, Once you've selected a template you like, click on the thumbnail of the template. You will see a page with a larger version of your chosen resume template. Click the green Download button on the right to Download the template to your computer and open it in Microsoft Word to edit.


Try to find the simplest, most professional-looking template that's appropriate for your job. Fonts like Times New Roman are appropriate, while fonts like Comic Sans are not if you're looking for a job. Once you find one that looks good to you, stop looking, download it, and get to work.
All of the options can be a bit overwhelming, but the look of the resume is the least important part. In general, you shouldn't have to spend more than 5 or 10 minutes at the most searching for a template that looks right. You're not going to get the job because your template was fancier than other applicants.

, Open the downloaded template file, and locate all the gray text boxes in which you can click to fill in your information.


At a quick glance, the template will appear to be already filled out. The text boxes exist to tell you what information to put where. In the top corner of most templates, for instance, will be a text box with the words ""Name"" and ""Address,"" formatted correctly for the information being asked for.

, Select the various headings you want to include on your resume, and make sure they're either already there before starting into the document and filling in your information. It's hard to make changes after you start editing the document.


On some templates, you can fill in the types of headings you want, the headings are pre-set. Common headings include, but are not limited to: work experience, school experience, special skills and other training, awards, and contacts.

, All resumes, at the top of the document, need your basic contact information: name, address, email address, and telephone number. These will be filled in with filler information, which you can highlight, and change to your own.

, Go through the document slowly, filling out all the necessary information. Take the time to double-check phone-numbers for your contacts, addresses for previous employers, and the dates of your employment. Be as specific as possible, especially when describing your duties and responsibilities as an employee.


It would look pretty foolish to turn in a resume with the default answers still filled out in one of the latter sections. Even if you think you've filled out everything, check again.

, If you've chosen a template with a specific category or blank for information that doesn't apply to the job you're applying for, you should neither try to make something up to put in it, nor should you leave it blank. Highlight the box and remove it from the document if it's not appropriate for the job.


A good example of this is something like, ""Rewards"" or ""Achievements"" on some academic resumes. It doesn't look good to have the category but leave it blank. Just delete it.

, Losing your progress can be frustrating, and it's also likely that you'll want to go back over the resume and make changes later, so be sure to save the document, even if you're planning on printing it to make copies. Make sure you have a digital copy of your resume.


When you're finished, consider saving a copy of your resume as a .pdf file under the ""Format"" list after you select ""Save As."" When you're finished, you'll be able to open the file on any computer without having to worry about formatting issues. If you're sending an electronic copy of your resume, though, make sure the company accepts .pdfs first.
Don't lose your resume! Save it somewhere you'll be able to remember, like Dropbox, or a thumb drive, and keep it on you so you won't have to go through this process again. You'll always need a resume on hand, and it's hard to tell when you'll need it again. You won't have to start form scratch next time if you save it now, and it'll be much easier to update.

, If you're starting on a large-scale job search, it would be best to make one basic resume and send that resume everywhere right? Wrong. Different places of employment will likely be looking for different things, so unless you're looking at identical positions at identical places of employment, you're probably better off doing a little bit of research first and making the best possible resume for each place, by making little changes.


Spend some time researching each prospective employer's website or hiring statement, taking time to note any special language they use in the ad. If an employer is looking for ""Someone who can follow directions explicitly"" and your resume highlights your ""Strong-minded leadership qualities,"" you might be out of line with the job.
There's a lot you can do to change the little things in the job descriptions to match the advertisement language. The more the employer thinks you've done your homework, the more you'll stand out in the crowd.

, It can get confusing quickly if you choose a template with a bunch of individual cells you'll have to figure out, and possibly reformat. Because the formatting of the templates often doesn't account for the amount of information you'll be typing into the individual boxes, the formatting can get messed up and it can be difficult to reformat the document correctly.


While tables, even invisible tables, can help to structure text, it can make customizing the document very difficult. If you're not experienced with formatting tables in word, don't get into it now.

, Highlight parts of the section titles that you don't like and rename them. If ""Work Experience"" would be more suitably-titled ""Construction Experience"" or ""Travel Experience,"" or whatever topic you'd like to highlight, highlight the offending term, change it by typing in the new heading, content, or title, and check to make sure you haven't messed up the formatting.


If changing something messes up the sizing, or the font, and you can't figure out how to change it back, you've got a couple options. It's likely the text has changed back to the Word default settings. You can either use the Style setting to make the document uniform (discussed in the following step) or go in manually.
To find what you want it to be, start by clicking elsewhere in the document, on text with the correct-looking style, and examine the toolbar at the top of the Word window to see how it's changed. Go back and highlight the text you want to change, and change it to the correct format in the toolbar, now that you know what it is.

, If making changes has messed up the formatting, sizing, or the fonts, click on the area of text that you want your messed-up text to look like. Select the entire paragraph, or group of text, right-click, select Styles, then Update style name to Match Selection. Now, highlight your messed-up text, and select ""Match Selection,"" and the text should reformat like you want it to., If you're applying for a job as a mason's apprentice, you need to highlight experience working with your hands outside, and your ability to follow instructions, not your experience as the leader of a punk band that went on tour last summer. Customize each resume to the job you're applying for, and eliminate any extra information that won't be helpful.

, It's a sad truth that the average employer looks at a resume for no more than a few seconds. Make sure that all the important information is easy to find, at right up front to give yourself the best shot at getting an interview. The best resumes are the briefest, highlighting all the necessary information in about the front side of one piece of paper, and no more than two pages.


It's a common misconception that longer resumes look better to employers. This is not the case at all. If you're worried about a lack of experience, it's better to let your resume be brief and efficient, than to pad it with desperate-looking descriptions of your leadership at a yard sale, or the obstacles you overcame as the captain of the soccer team.
Always defer to the job description. If an employer is looking specifically for something with charisma and a sense of humor, like at a web start-up or a magazine, it might be appropriate to include a witty description of your yard sale leadership, if it's appropriate. Use your best judgment.
Your resume doesn't need to ""sound smarter"" than you are. Don't waste a bunch of time looking up 20-dollar words to describe something simple. Nothing will get you the job faster than relevant experience and seriousness.

, One of the most common ways to make your resume pop is to use vibrant descriptions of your previous employment responsibilities. Your descriptions of your duties and responsibilities at your previous employers should be short and sweet. To do this, there's a particular technique of standing a sentence with an action word to give your short bullet points or descriptions the most punch. Buzz words that are always good to use include:


innovated
motivated
facilitated
organized
simplified
managed
examined

, If your template is organized into bullet points and sub-points for your description of each job, you don't need to use complete sentences for the bullets, but it does make it important to be consistent in the style. They should all have the same sentence structure, even if they're not complete sentences.


If one bullet starts with ""facilitated"" the next can't start with ""I worked to."" Instead, it should read ""worked to,"" so they'll be parallel.

, Your job descriptions are the best way to give yourself credit for things you deserve credit for, but that might not necessarily show up on a cold description of your job written by somebody else. Make yourself look good. It's not lying.


If you were the only person at your previous job to ever clean up the mess at the end of the day, you might say that you ""facilitated teamwork by organizing the work site more efficiently.""
If you organized a carpool, you might say that you ""streamlined the office commute by incorporating co-operative ride sharing.""

, Most resumes will ask for personal or employment contacts. It's a good idea to think about these seriously beforehand and talk to your contacts, coaching them slightly on the nature of the job and what it is you're applying for. It doesn't look good if an employer cold-calls your contact and they're not expecting it, not available, or unwilling to give you a glowing recommendation.


Only pick contacts who will say good things about you. If you were fired from your last job, provide personal contacts with a relevant knowledge of your work history who can vouch for your reliability and your seriousness as a candidate, and older employers. Call and ask politely if you can use them as a reference.

Wait until the baby is an appropriate age.,
Secure the baby’s head and neck.,
Protect the baby’s elbows and joints.,
Watch for signs of happy play.,
Stop if the baby cries.,
Avoid roughhousing before bed.",How to Safely Rough and Tumble Play with Your Baby3," Babies can start playing very young, but you may want to wait until the baby is a little older to start some activities. While newborns may enjoy being held and bounced, you may want to wait until the baby is three or four months old before you start swinging them around or lifting them high in the air., Babies have weak neck muscles, and they may not be able to protect their heads during play. While playing, make sure that the head and neck are supported. Place a hand beneath the baby’s neck. The baby’s head should not be snapping back and forth, nor should the baby experience any whiplash. If you notice this happening, stop immediately. Try slower movements in the future with wider arcs of movement., Your baby may not have developed strong joints or muscles yet, and vigorous play may cause accidental injury. When handling your baby, hold them under the arms instead of by the hands or elbows. Do not hold them by the feet or upside down., If the baby is enjoying themselves, they will likely be smiling or giggling. Their muscles will be relaxed. They will interact with you, by touching your face or mimicking your movements., If the baby starts crying, it means that they are not enjoying the rough play. While rough play can be beneficial to babies, it is not advisable to continue if the baby is uncomfortable. Other signs of discomfort include clenching face muscles or excessive squirming., It is best not to rile up the baby too much before they go to bed. Too much excitement may interfere with their sleeping patterns. It is better to rough play earlier in the day when they do not have to sleep. Allow them to wind down before taking a nap or going to bed."

Practice forgiving.",How to Have Good Vibes," On a daily basis, read inspirational quotes. Surprisingly, they can have a massive positive impact on the pessimist seeking optimism, in other words, they make you feel happy and maybe even fill you with elation. Believe in them, they are words of someone who has suffered like you.;
, Think back to all the happy times in your life, maybe even when your mum said you're pretty, the birth of your first child or when you met your partner, these all make you ecstatic. Write these down. They can be funny times too, like when you saw the most humorous meme in your life, etc. Talk to friends, they can also lighten your mood. Socialising is a huge step in becoming a happy, lively person.

, Think things like, ""I guess my eyes are beautiful,"" or, ""Only I could have scored that triple hat-trick!"" Write these down and refer to them every day. You are you, no one is a copy, not even a twin of yours! Take part in things you do best, and beam when someone praises your win or efforts. This will make you not only a stronger being but a bigger, more optimistic person. Think, do you really want to spend the rest of your life in misery?

, Go on trips with your friends, your family etc. These days out, weekends away and short breaks will distract you from life's problems and make you feel good. Enjoy life as it is! Forget all your worries and don't refrain from talking to and meeting new people. Also, maintain good hygiene, this will actually affect your mood. Drinking water may make you feel amazing, it's scientifically proven that you'll die without water.

, Have people told you that you can play the violin really well? Well, why not give it a try? Everyone has talent, for some it just takes longer to find. This will give you hope and maybe even pave a way for you in life, it has for many successful people today. If you feel up to it, why not go in a competition designed for your talent, like a football tournament or spelling bee or go for that promotion. Ask people what they think you're good at, look back at school levels, and incorporate your very own feelings too. This will help you find your talent quicker.

, Hide from thinking about dark things such as death, loneliness, demons etc, even if you've been diagnosed with cancer, you can have good vibes, everyone can! Rather, ponder on about friends, that day out, love etc. Maybe, don't watch or read as many horror movies or read so many sad sagas. Replace them with comedy. This will give you a happy feeling and erase away any scary ones about divorced bankruptcy, a loved one dying, being made redundant, not getting into the college or university you were banking on etc.

, If someone/thing is bugging you and making you feel nervous, angry, sad or scared, tell someone! Make sure you trust them, and they know what they're doing. Sort it out as soon as possible, this will stop the negative feelings boiling and bubbling up inside you. Make good friends and stick with them.

, Got invited to a party? Go there and let loose! Don't hang back unless it's for a reason like it's not safe etc. Talk to the guy in front of you on the train seems like he's reading the same book as you. This is how friendships start, so make them start! Don't talk about sadness, talk about lively things.

, Good vibes are felt by others when they feel accepted. If you know that something is wrong with someone else, do not push it on them instead make them feel at ease. Acts of kindness go a long way in clearing any negativity on your path and in your vibes.

, There are many people who hurt you and leave you reeling in pain. If you think of them more often then you stand a chance to disturb your sense of peace and seem aggressive. Seek forgiveness for your mistakes and don't hesitate in forgiving those who wronged you in any way. A kinder and forgiving heart opens the doors to clearing your vibes. Moreover, you look more approachable and kind-hearted.

Secure your home.,
Pet-proof rooftops, balconies, or other outdoor play areas.,
Beware of old/faulty wiring or radiator heaters.,
Provide a proper habitat or enclosure for your pet.",How to Protect Pets from Urban Dangers1," As the primary habitat of your pet, your home needs to be pet-proofed. This is especially important in urban areas, since your pet will be spending a lot more time in your home. When securing your home, consider:


Installing a security system.
Making sure windows and doors close and lock properly. You don’t want someone breaking in or your pet breaking out.
Making sure the structure is sound and healthy. Mold, mildew, lead paint, and other dangers will impact your pet just as they impact you. Such dangers are especially problematic since your pet won’t have the ability to roam freely outside.;
, One of the greatest urban dangers for pets is related to the limited safe outdoor areas for them to play in or go to the bathroom. Because of this, many pet owners turn to rooftops, balconies, and other areas that offer unique dangers not present in suburban or rural areas.


Make sure rooftop terraces are fenced appropriately so your pet won’t fall off the building.
Pay attention to the spaces in-between fence or balcony posts. Skinny or small dogs might be able to slip out and over the side of the building.
Patch any holes under fences in backyard areas. Dogs or other pets that slip out may find themselves in the middle of oncoming traffic., Older buildings with faulty wiring or antiquated heaters represent more dangers to pets in urban areas. Such problems put pets at risk since they don’t understand their dangers.


Make sure no wiring is exposed. Ultimately, you don’t want your pet chewing on or playing with wires.
Replace or pet-proof radiator heaters. Such heaters are especially dangerous because many pets are drawn their warmth and won’t understand that they can get burned.

, Whatever your pet, being in an urban area likely means that you and your pet will have to share smaller confines -- whether it be a smaller house or apartment. As a result, you need to make sure that you don't cut corners on providing large enough habitats or enclosures for your pet.


Make sure you follow ASCPA or Humane Society guidelines/recommendations for the size of enclosures.
Never let animals like rodents, birds, or reptiles roam your home. It will just take one minute for your pet to get out and become lost in the dangerous urban environment.
Avoid overcrowding in your animal enclosures. Just because you don't have enough room for enclosures for all of your pets does not mean your animals should suffer."

Prevent your baby from getting too warm in the summer.,
Avoid clothing with beads, bows, drawstrings, or other choking hazards.",How to Stock Baby Clothes for the First Month," To make your baby’s many daily wardrobe changes easier, faster, and painless, dress them in shirts that are easy to slide over the head. Stock up on 4 to 7 shirts for the first month in size 0 to 3 months. Buy a few simple shirts that have buttons along the shoulder, or opt for tee shirts and turtlenecks that have larger neck holes.


Ask friend and family members if they have any hand-me-downs that they would be willing to pass along to you.;
, Speed up diaper changes by dressing your baby in pull-over pants or leggings. Buy pants with elastic bands, and look for pants that are fastened with Velcro or easy-to-open pop buttons.Keep 5 to 7 pairs of pants on hand during the first month.

, Newborns spend a lot of time sleeping, so it is important that they have comfortable, cozy sleepsuits and bodysuits. Plan to have 6-8 sleepsuits and 6-8 bodysuits during the first month.Babies grow very quickly, and although it may seem like a lot of clothing to have at home, you will be thankful for the selection when some are dirty or are in the wash.


Store a variety of hassle-free bodysuits and sleepsuits, including a few long-sleeved and a few short-sleeved options.Stock suits that will fit a 0-3 month-old infant., Dressing your baby in layers not only makes a diaper change more efficient, but it will also help you regulate your child’s temperature. Babies lose heat more rapidly than adults do.Keep a sweater or a cardigan on hand to easily warm up your baby if they are cold. If your baby was born during the winter months, plan to stock up on 2 or 3 of these warmer items.


Look for sweaters that have buttons down the front so you do not have to struggle placing the sweater over your child’s head., It is important to protect your child’s head from both the cold weather and the heat. In the winter, have a warm cap or a winter hat to ensure that your baby does not lose heat through the top of their head. In the summertime, make sure your 1-month old has a wide-brimmed hat to protect them from the sun’s harmful rays., Your newborn will need 3-4 pairs of socks and booties to keep their feet warm and protected.Socks are easily lost and kicked off, so be sure to have some extra pairs around during the first month. Check to see that your baby is able to wiggle their toes while wearing them, and opt for pairs that have elastic bands to keep them snug and secure., Newborn fingernails are soft, but they are strong enough to cause some marks and scratches to show up on your baby's face. To protect their skin, keep 1 or 2 pairs of scratch mittens in your baby’s closet.Buy soft, cotton mittens for your newborn to wear during nap time.

, If your baby is due during the cold winter months, you will need to dress your newborn in layers to keep them warm and to protect them against frostbite and hypothermia.Babies lose heat more rapidly than adults do. It is best to dress them in an undershirt, pajamas or a dressing gown, and then cover them with a blanket or add a winter coat.The rule of thumb is to dress them in one more layer than you would typically wear in those conditions. Be sure to store plenty of warm layers.


If you are going out in the snow, your baby will need a pair of winter boots and gloves.

, If your baby will be outside in the heat during their first month, you can reduce your baby’s clothes to one layer to prevent them from overheating.Stock up on long-sleeved, lightly-colored clothing items to protect them from sun exposure. A natural fiber like cotton will absorb sweat easily. This will help them from overheating and will prevent heat rash from developing.If your baby is premature, plan to dress them in an additional layer of clothing in all weather conditions., If something looks like it can be removed from your child’s clothing, don’t use it. It could be a potential choking hazard. Do not place your baby in clothing that is decorated with beads, bows, or drawstrings or anything else that looks like it can be easily removed. Many baby clothing brands do not add these decorations, but be mindful of homemade clothing or hand-me-down items when you are stocking up on clothing."

Care for your hands and nails- once a week cut nails if they are getting to long or collecting dirt underneath, short square shaped nails look most natural.,
Manicures are when you do the nails on your hands, Pedicures are when you do your feet.,
Now you know the basic manicure, here are some classy and casual nail looks, and a few nail art designs which are all relatively easy to achieve.,
Sassy at school- Most schools prefer it if you don't wear nail color but clear and sheer shades are normally allowed.,
Shades to try- clear,soft sparkly brown, sheer brown or pale pink.

,
Stepping into spring- bright colors and stand out shades are the way to go for this look!,
Shades to try- Bright blue, pink and purple,soft coral and rich red.

,
Cool nail art- Normally you would consider nail art with lots of fussy stickers and jewels but effective art doesn't always mean adding little bits and pieces even though it can look very good.,
Strawberry- paint your nails are dark red shade and leave to dry.,
Stripes- Paint your nails with a clear polish and leave to dry ( so your next shades still have something to cling onto).",How to Care for Hands and Apply Nail Polish for Springtime/Summer Looks," Use an emery board if necessary to file off any broken pieces and for daily nourishment, always wash and moisturise with a rich hand cream.;
, Only bother with Pedicures if you are going to maybe be barefoot or feel like it as nail polish on your toes can sometimes be forgotten and chipped nail polish,anywhere, never looks good. You could try having an indulgent manicure once a week. Start by washing and moisturizing hands with soap or cream. Cut nails and file, but be careful not to trim to deep or cut your fingers, as they can feel sore the next day. If you are going to be wearing very dark or bright nail polish, try to use a base coat ( clear nail polish- you can use for top coat if needed too) and leave to dry. Remember to sit still! Now paint on your chosen color (if added) and wait to dry again.

, For smudge free nails, sit still for at least 10 minutes and always remove polish with nail varnish remover as soon as the paint starts to chip. -

, Just keep your hands nice if nail polish isn't allowed. Wash, moisturise and trim ( long nails get in the way of your busy day and class schedule) then paint on your nail polish by doing one thick stripe in the middle and two thinner ones at the side. Do one hand, wait to dry than the next. This look is really subtle but still really pretty.

,, Cutting nails is very important for this as long oval nails can take away the effect and small splashes of color. Use the same nail painting technique as before and leave to dry.

,, Both of these looks are just paint effects.

, Using a green nail polish, do some soft zigzags round the top of nail and leave to dry. Next, very carefully ( maybe using a cotton bud or cuticle stick, depending on the thickness), dot white spots over the red but still so its more of the shade underneath. This is the fruit, the leaves and the seeds. Repeat all.

, Take one color and paint one thick stripe through the middle of the nail. Now with two different shades, do two thin stripes down the side. Repeat all.

Determine the right colour grout you’d like to use.,
Opt for a grout colour that blends with the mosaic tile.,
Select a grout colour that contrasts the mosaic tile colours.,
Pick a grout colour that acts as an accent to the tile.",How to Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects3," Keep in mind that although colour can be provided by grout, it is best to allow the tile to provide the colour in mosaic designs. Most designers advise you to use grout that acts like a thin gray line in order to make tiles appear distinct without venturing on too boldly.


White grout can appear very harsh as it will draw the eye to the gaps rather than the coloured tiles. However, it can be a complement to lighter tones so it is very good for showing off pale mosaics. And when used with strong bright colours, it will produce a Mediterranean feel.
Grey grout enhances most coloured tesserae and has the most unifying effect of all the coloured grouts.
Dark grout unifies darker coloured tesserae and segregates lighter ones.

, It’s impossible to match a grout colour to the exact colour of a tile due to the variations of shading most tiles possess. Opt for a grout colour that is in the same colour family or blends with the tile. This is a common selection for people who wish for the focus to be on the entire floor versus the individual tile.

, Choosing a grout colour that contrasts your tile focuses your eye to see the tile as an individual instead of an entire picture, as you would with blending grout colours. This is great for people who want a black and white pattern or checkerboard effect on their floors.


For example, gray grout should not be used with a gray tile. Use a red-brown terra cotta grout for gray tile instead.Avoid matching colours and gravitate towards contrasting colours.

, Accent colours are used by people who want to compliment an accent colour they might be using in their overall design scheme. If you go with this option, understand that if you ever are to change your design theme later down on the road, you might have to change the grout colour you used initially as well.

You can get protein powder sweetened or unsweetened. Consider getting the sweetened kind for this recipe. This way, you won't have to add extra sweetener to it.
The salt is not absolutely necessary, but it can help cut the sweetness of overly-sweet protein powder.;
, Pat down the dry mixture first, then make a well. Add the eggs, water, and oil into the well. Whisk everything together until just combined. If the mixture is still too thin, whisk in a little bit more protein powder.


You can also use an egg substitute instead.

Consider adding in some tasty extras, such as ground cinnamon, fruit, nuts, or pieces of cooked bacon.

, Use a soup ladle to measure out about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of pancake batter and pour it onto the skillet. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to fit more than one pancake, as long as they do not touch., This will only take 25 to 30 seconds. As soon as you see the bubbles, wait for them to burst, then slide a spatula under the pancake and flip it over.

, This should only take about 25 to 30 seconds. Once the pancake is cooked, slide it off the pan and onto a plate.

, You have enough batter to make 2 large pancakes or 6 small ones. Re-grease the pan if it starts to turn too dry.

, You can eat them as they are, or serve them with your favorite pancake syrup. Yogurt or sugar-free preserves are another tasty option. You can also sprinkle some sugar substitute, such as Stevia, on top.

Spot treat problem areas with a drying lotion.,
Apply lemon juice and leave on overnight.,
Strive to get high quality sleep.,
Wash your face before bed.",How to Get Clear Skin in a Day3," Pick up a drying lotion at your local drugstore or supermarket. Look for something with antibacterial properties, and something that includes sulfur and salicylic acid. Use a q-tip to apply the lotion to any pimples and blemishes., Many believe lemon has antibacterial properties that can help clear acne fast. Squeeze some juice out of a fresh lemon. Then, dab a q-tip in the juice and dab onto problem areas. Leave on overnight and see if your skin has cleared up., Making sure you have high quality sleep may improve the appearance of skin the next day. Try to make sure you get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. You can start by powering down electronics, as the blue screen from phones and laptops have a stimulating effect on the brain. You should also have some kind of relaxing ritual, like reading, that you engage in before bed to help you wind down for rest., If you want your skin to clear up fast, make a habit of washing it each night before bed. Use a mild cleanser and lukewarm water to wash your face before bed at night. Wash gently, as excessive scrubbing can cause skin irritation."

Give Gravedigger items to the Pig King.,
Wait for an earthquake in the Caverns.,
Kill the Bunnymen you find in the Caverns.,
Go fishing in the Ruins.",How to Farm Gold in Don’t Starve2," Sometimes, you’ll find large patches of raised soil every now and then when exploring the world, or some headstones lying around in the Forest. Those are graves, and you can dig those up with a Shovel, which you can make for 2 Twigs and 2 Flint in your Science Machine. If you’ve dug up some graves and found some odd little things, you can take them to the Pig King, and chances are, he’ll accept them for quite a few pieces of Gold, normally more than what most Meats can net you.


The items you might dig up from graves include knots, buttons, toys, and a lawn gnome, which apparently amuses the Pig King immensely, judging by the amount of Gold he hands you.
Graves, and therefore items from them, are non-renewable and scarce in the original game, however, and must be considered as a sort of last resort if you need a lot of Gold at once. In the Reign of the Giants DLC of the PC edition and the console edition, these items can sometimes be found by breaking open Tumbleweeds in the Desert, but it’s still not very reliable despite the yield.

, Caverns are found by mining a large, craggy boulder called a Plugged Sinkhole you sometimes encounter while exploring, and going down the revealed hole in the ground. An earthquake would naturally and randomly happen underground, and would normally net you a small amount of Gold once it ends, though you’d have to be careful during it as rocks are constantly falling and will damage the player when hit with a falling rock.


You can sometimes trigger earthquakes by detonating Gunpowder and Slurtle Slime while in the Caverns. You can make Gunpowder by combining a Rotten Egg, Charcoal, and Nitre, and you can get Slurtle Slime by killing Slurtles, which look like an odd combination of turtle and slug, or feeding them plenty of Rocks.

, Sometimes, when exploring the Caverns, you will encounter giant white rabbits hopping around, or a carrot-shaped house. These Bunnymen are the underground equivalent of the Pigs, which means you could befriend them with carrots and they will aid you for as long as their loyalty lasts. You can also kill them by hitting them with a weapon or tool, or by letting them fight monsters for you. Killing them will net you a carrot, a piece of meat, and occasionally, a Bunny Puff, which you can trade to the Pig King for 2 Gold Nuggets. However, it’s an uncommon drop from the Bunnymen despite its worth.

, The Ruins is a layer lower than the Caverns and accessed by mining an orange pile of rock and going down in the resulting hole. When you find a pond and fish in the Ruins, you’ll get an Eel, which is renewable and worth a good 5 Gold Nuggets each when traded to the Pig King, unlike other Meat items. Fishing in the Ruins is reserved for late-game ventures, though, since the area is very dangerous.

Consider hiring an attorney.,
Put all terms in the lease.,
Be sure all parties sign the lease.,
Get a copy of the lease after all parties have signed it.",How to Negotiate a Commercial Lease3," Landlord/tenant law is very detailed and confusing. If you can afford a local attorney who knows the ins and outs of your state’s landlord/tenant laws, it would be best to hire one. See https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Good-Attorney.

, Ensure that everything that was agreed upon is in the written lease. If a term is not in the lease, it will likely not be enforced if you have to go to court. If the landlord provides a form lease, review it for all terms. Have your attorney review it if you have any questions. Ask for changes if the written lease does not reflect your oral agreement. If you are writing your own lease, you can find sample commercial leases by searching for commercial leases in your state online. Since landlord/tenant and contract law are state laws, be sure the sample you use has been written specifically for use in your state., A lease for greater than one year must be signed by all parties to be enforceable. Even for a lease of less than one year, a signed lease is higher proof of the agreement than simple testimony., If a disagreement arises, the courts will likely require a copy of the contract signed by all parties to be filed with the court.

Then, figure out how many days you have left before your exams. Divide the number of days left before exams by the number of subjects you need to prepare for. Now you know how many days you have available to prepare for each subject., Use your textbook and learning materials to determine the specific topic areas within each subject. English Literature, for example, may be broken down into the different books you are studying and then further into chapters, themes, or quotes. Highlight or circle the topics using different colours. Figure out how many topics or sub categories you have for each subject. Then, divide up the time you have for the subject into study blocks for each topic., If you are currently employed, you should review your work schedule for the upcoming weeks. Figure out where you can schedule study-time between your shifts.If you have a lot of upcoming shifts, consider working less so that you have more time for revisions.

Understand the possible reasons behind plant-damaging behavior.,
Have regular play-sessions with your cat.,
Use toys that will get your cat moving.Although your cat will love the attention either way, don't let your play sessions turn into cuddle sessions.,
Leave toys out for him while you're gone.",How to Prevent Cats from Eating Plants2," Your cat might just be bored to tears cooped up in your house. If moving leaves are the closest thing to toys or prey in his environment, it should be no surprise when your cat is drawn to them. To best curb plant-damaging behavior, you need to provide your cat with healthier alternatives.

, Some breeds of cat are far more active than others, so you'll be the best judge of how much play your cat needs. As a general rule, though, it's best to play with your cat at least twice a day for 5-10 minutes each time.

, You need to get your cat excited and winded to prevent him from chomping on your plants.


Use toys that are on the end of a long string, so you can make your cat run from one end of the room to the other without exhausting yourself.
Not all cats respond to laser pointers, but if your cat does, you're in luck! You can lounge on the couch and enjoy a snack while your cat runs all over the place trying to catch the little red dot!

, Your cat might get especially bored when there's nobody around to keep him company. Leaving toys out for him when he's alone gives him more constructive outlets for his boredom than plant-chewing.


Rotate the toys out so he doesn't get bored with the same ones day after day. Your cat will ignore a toy he's become too familiar with.
However, if it reappears after a long absence, he'll be excited about it again.

Set up the fingerprint card.,
Decide on a fingerprint method.,
Clean hands.,
Grasp the subject's hand.,
Roll the right thumb over the ink.,
Roll the thumb over the fingerprint card.,
Repeat with remaining fingers.,
Take the plain impressions.,
Retab over mistakes.,
Alter the amount of ink.,
Reduce sweat with cloth or alcohol.,
Note missing fingerprint areas.,
Deal with difficult fingerprints.,
Fill out the entire card.,
Analyze the fingerprints.",How to Take Fingerprints," You can print fingerprint cards from free online images. Try this one used by the FBI and other US agencies. Position the card on a special stand, or just weigh it down with a heavy object to stop it sliding.



If you are taking fingerprints for an official purpose, you may need to find a fingerprint card you are authorized to use. Even if your agency is authorized to use the card linked above, it should order it using these instructions on the FBI website.;
, There are several different methods used to take fingerprints. Here are a few of the most common:










Ink pad: Find a special ""porelon pad"" for fingerprinting. Use as a normal ink pad, no preparation needed.
Glass plate: Dab printer's ink or fingerprint ink onto a glass or metal plate, fixed in place. Roll ink out with a rubber ink roller until thin and even.Inkless pad: Special pads are available that will not stain fingers. Check the instructions in case special preparation is needed.
Fingerprint scanner: An electronic device. The process is not covered here; check product instructions, and confirm that the device is approved by your agency.

, Have the subject wash and dry his hands to remove dirt that may obscure the fingerprints. Check the hands for lint from the towel, and ask him to brush it off if present.If soap and water are not available, rubbing alcohol is the second best option.Have the subject sign the card before washing his hands. Use blue or black ink.

, The subject does not fill out his own fingerprint card. You, the person tasked with taking the fingerprint, will do it for him. Hold the base of the subjects thumb, tucking unused fingers under your hand. With your other hand, hold the subject's finger just below the nail tip, and at the third joint.Keep the wrist level with the hand. If possible, move the fingerprint station to a height level with the subject's arm.
Ask the subject to look away if they seem to be ""helping;"" the fingerprint will be more clear if only you are controlling the hand., Your goal is to ink the thumb from the top of the pad to ¼ inch (6mm) below the first joint. Place the side of the thumb nearest the forefinger onto the ink, right against the nail. Roll the thumb past the thumbprint, and continue until it touches the opposite nail.









You can remember the direction as ""awkward to comfortable"" — try it out and you'll see what this means.

, Find the area of the card labeled for the right thumb. Roll the inked thumb over the card, in the same direction as you did before. Roll at a steady pace, and with light pressure only. Changing speed or pressure can cause smudges. Roll one time only, not back and forth.










Lift the thumb up directly when finished, to avoid smudging.

, Put your hands together with the backs facing you, then turn them palm up. This is the direction your fingers should rotate — which still follows the ""awkward to comfortable"" rule.Apart from this change, the process is the same as the thumb. Record the fingerprints of the right hand, then the left thumb, then the fingers on the left hand.










If using an inking plate, you need to roll out the ink again before each finger. Otherwise, you may end up with an image of two overlapping prints.Make sure you have each fingerprint in the correct box of the card, that the impression goes from nail edge to nail edge, and down to ¼ inch (6mm) below the first joint.
Let the subject wipe off ink from the right hand before moving on to the left.

, Your fingerprint card should have two additional spaces for thumbs, and two large spaces marked ""four fingers simultaneously."" In the same order as above (right thumb, right hand, left thumb, left hand), ink the fingerprint and press it flat against the paper, without rolling. For the fingers, you'll do all four fingers at once. You'll often need to rotate the fingers slightly to fit them all in the available space.









These are also called ""flat"" or ""slap"" impressions.These are used to verify that the fingerprints are in the correct boxes. Some features are also more visible on the plain impression., Retabs are small squares of adhesive paper you can press over the paper to cover smudges, partial fingerprints, and other mistakes. Retake the fingerprint onto the retab. More than two retabs on one card makes it likely that your card will be rejected.










US law enforcement agencies can order these from the FBI.

, If the ridges of the fingerprint are obscured by solid black areas, you have too much ink. If areas of the fingerprint are white, you have too little. If using a fingerprinting plate, try again with more or less ink rolled onto it. If using an ink pad, the ink pad probably needs to be replaced.










Many general purpose ink pads are not suitable for fingerprinting. Look for a Porelon pad instead.

, Blurry fingerprints are usually caused by sweat (or an unsuitable type of ink). Wipe the finger with a cloth and take the fingerprint immediately. Rubbing alcohol will also help dry the hand.








, If there is a reason you can't show the whole fingerprint, write this down or your card will be rejected. Typically, the reason is ""fully amputated,"" ""tip amputated,"" or ""missing from birth.""



Extra fingers are not recorded by the FBI.Other agencies may request that you record the extra fingers on the back of the card. Try to find specific guidelines for your purposes.

, People in many professions or hobbies wear down their fingerprints over the years. If the fingerprints won't come out clearly, try one or more of these techniques:""Milk the fingerprint"" by pressing it or rubbing it in a downward motion from palm to fingertip, before taking the print.
Rub worn prints with hand lotion or creams.
Hold ice against the fingerprint, then dry and print. This works best on naturally small ridges and soft hands, not worn prints.
Use very little ink and very light pressure.
Note the condition of the prints, especially if worn smooth. Note the occupation that led to this problem.

, Your card will likely be rejected if there is any missing information. Use blue or black ink to fill out every box. If you are not sure what to put in a box, ask someone with more experience, or look online for your agency's guidelines. Even a ""Weight"" or ""Date of Birth"" box needs to follow an exact format to keep the database consistent.


, Familiarize yourself with the basics, and you'll do a better job noticing problems with fingerprint impressions. Here's the first lesson:95% of people have fingerprints with loops (ridges forming a curved U shape) and/or whorls (circles). The rest are arches, with ridges that rise to a bend or peak, then continue onward instead of curving back. Make sure you get enough of the print to tell which type it is.
""Deltas"" are any point on the fingerprint where ridges meet from three directions. If you don't see at least one on a loop or whorl print, make sure you have covered the entire fingerprint. Rarely, a delta is not visible, in which case you should note on your card ""no delta, inked nail to nail.""

Stop the negative spiraling.,
Be accepting that you can't make other people into something they are not.,
Be patient.,
Find and make the most of distractions.,
Look for the lesson.,
Keep a lid on the desire to vent.,
Remember that you're not alone.,
Stay involved.,
Relax, there's plenty of time to find love.",How to Stop Being Depressed About Love," There is little point being constantly negative about yourself or your chances in love. This is a bad habit and it deserves to be broken. While it is fine to be down and sad every now and then, it's not fine to have this as your usual temperament.;
, This includes trying to make someone love you; it will happen if it's meant to be but if they change and their love for you also changes, it isn't a good idea to take out their choices on your own self-esteem.

, Love is a very varied ideal and no two people have the same notion of what it is, or is not. This is often the reason behind why love relationships don't always work out because both parties have different viewpoints of what love is and how it should be impacting their lives. In being patient, you can do several important things for yourself:


You can get on with your life and the activities you enjoy
You can cultivate your interests to the greatest extent possible
You can open to all the incredible possibilities that are still awaiting you, including and especially love
You can learn self-patience and apply that to everyday life

, Pursue your hobbies, watch your favorite movies, head outdoors with a trusted friend, etc. When love is getting you down, do something to get on top of the blues. Action is always the best antidote to moping and negativity.

, Being rejected is never pleasant but each time something like that happens to us, there is something we can learn about ourselves, about how relationships develop or fade. Look for what you can take from this to apply to future relationships rather than trying to go over what could have been different. A lot could have been different but hindsight does not changes the past; it only informs the future.

, It's easy to go on and on about a person who has rejected you but, in the end, this merely serves to make you feel a lot worse and word will get around that you whine post-relationships and that might scare people away. By all means have a good vent with a close friend, your mom, or the therapist but be sure whoever you tell will keep it behind closed doors. When explaining to others what happened, keep it light and say simply ""Oh that, yes, well, it didn't work out. We decided to both move on.""

, Most humans will experience love at its best and at its worst as they grow through life. Many people know how hard it is to hurt over a lost love; however, the reality is that people move on. Picking up the pieces, taking the lessons with us, is part and parcel of being human.

, Keep seeing people, keep getting out and doing things. Depression has a habit of keeping a person at home, where it feels worse. Getting out more is a key to moving on.

, It will come, even if you're in your 90s.

Understand that recognizing PTSD in yourself is the first step towards recovery.,
Monitor for moments where you feel like you are re-experiencing the traumatic situation.,
Acknowledge feelings of avoidance.,
Be aware of signs of hyper-arousal.",How to Treat PTSD1," The only way that you can really recover from PTSD is to come to terms with the fact that you have this condition. Otherwise, you will not seek treatment for it in the first place. If you are not sure whether or not you have PTSD, you should look out for four main categories of PTSD-related symptoms: Intrusive re-experiencing of emotions and images related to the traumatic event.
Feelings of avoidance, such as trying to avoid thinking about or talking about the negative event that occurred.
Hyper-arousal and sensitivity to things like loud noises.
Negative changes in thinking and feeling, such as emotional numbness, hopelessness about the future, and/or a lack of interest in activities once enjoyed.;
, Symptoms of re-experiencing are those that bring the sufferer back, mentally, to the traumatic event and the emotions associated with it. Flashbacks can arouse negative emotions in the PTSD sufferer. These flashbacks can completely override what is currently happening and replace the present context with thoughts that bring back memories of the past trauma.Re-experiencing can include flashbacks, nightmares, and irrational thoughts usually driven by fear.

, Avoidance can mean intentionally blocking out specific parts of the traumatic experience. This may not just be simply forgetting the events that transpired through the ordeal but can involve an intentional blocking of details in the hopes that this can make it all go away. Avoidance can also manifest as a refusal to go to the place where the event happened, see the people that were a part of the event, or be around items that remind you of the experience.
Avoidance can also manifest itself as the experience of emotional numbness; this is your mind shutting out the emotions you had during the traumatic event.

, Hyper-arousal symptoms are generally always present in a person with PTSD. Hyper-arousal can also be described as being constantly ‘on edge’. On edge can mean being started by loud noises or sudden movements. It can also refer to emotional overreactions to minor events.Hyper-arousal can lead to difficulty sleeping. You might find that the softest noise wakes you up or that you feel like you are constantly half awake when you should be sleeping.

Make sure you're allowed to have a car boot sale.,

Knowing you have gained the proper permissions for a sale will give you peace of mind and help you avoid a fine, as well as reassure customers you are not a troublemaker.;
, Go through all your rooms, draws and cupboards. If you think there is something you could sell at a car boot sale, then put it into a selling pile. Anything really does go at a car boot sale, so dig deep into your closets for clothing, toys, kitchen utensils, and whatever else you want to get rid of!


When you have a pile with potential items ready, check that everything is in good condition. Would you buy it in its current condition? If the answer is no, try to clean it up or make it more acceptable. If you can't, take it out of the selling pile.

, Bear in mind that most potential buyers are usually bargain hunters, so to get more stock sold, try to lower the price a fraction. This will not only help more stock to be sold, but also earn you a reputation as a great place to go in the future.

, People are not going to come to your sale if they don't know about it. Why not try making some posters, or posting/handing out leaflets?

, There is nothing like getting to your location and struggling to set up your sale. This can be potentially embarrassing and damage your reputation. However, if you are having the sale outside our home, wrapping up products is not always necessary, except for in the event of bad weather etc.

, Be sure to get there early to get a good spot, as well as getting your products all set out nicely. Remember, presentation can make or break your sale. A messy table will not attract as many customers as a clean and tidy looking one.

, This is the fun part, as you are going to make money. Remember to be friendly, but do not be afraid to report trouble makers. Also, keep an eye out for thieves. A place like this can be a heaven for thieves. Keep an eye on your items and hard earned cash at all times!

, Start to pack away any unsold items you may have left over.

, Hopefully you will have made some serious money, which can then help in many ways. Whether it helps paying the bills, buying gifts for Christmas, or even treating yourself, it will certainly help.

Learn how to recognize common signs of aggression.,
Understand that there is no quick fix for aggression.,
Consider having a consultation with a registered pet behaviorist.,
Change your routine to reduce exposure to triggers.",How to Stop Aggressive Behavior in Dogs4," Dogs respond with aggression for many different reasons. Your dog’s aggressive behavior may be triggered by a certain type of person or situation. For example, some dogs become aggressive when new people visit, or when people walk past your dog’s yard area. Try to identify your dog’s triggers to help you as you attempt to retrain him., Pay special attention to his body language when he is exposed to one of his triggers. Many dogs are fearful or anxious prior to aggression. Common signs to watch for include a lowered head, low body posture, tail tucked between the legs, licking lips, looking away, dilated eyes, shivering or shaking., A dog that intends to attack will make a subtle change in the way he is standing. He will make direct eye contact and stare at his target. Then he will shift his weight so that it is over his front legs. He may also give a stiff tail wag with his tail held low. Watch for these signs because they indicate that a dog is about to lunge.If you are ever faced with a dog showing any of these signs, your best defense is to step aside or away from the dog and avoid staring back at him. Be quiet and calm as you do so.
If you notice your dog behaving this way, get him under control with a leash or bring him inside immediately.

, You will not be able to solve your dog’s aggression problem with a single training session. Retraining an aggressive dog takes time. Be patient and take precautions (such as a strong leash and a muzzle) to protect yourself and others as you retrain your dog.Never hit or punish your aggressive dog. Doing so will cause your dog to become over excited, or if his aggression is due to anxiety it will make him more fearful. As a result, his aggression may become worse.

, To increase your chances of success in retraining your dog, it is a good idea to consider a consultation with a registered pet behaviorist.Aggression has many contributing factors and a home consultation with an expert may give you the best chance of identifying all of these factors and working out the best strategy to control them.For example your dog may have a fear of strangers or other dogs, territorial aggression, or be prone to protecting a resource such as food.
Ask your veterinarian for help finding a registered pet behaviorist in your area.

, While you are retraining your dog, try to avoid his triggers. This might mean changing your walk route to something that is quieter and less used by dog walkers or playing vigorous games in the yard to burn off energy rather than going to the park."

Pick the right tip.Choosing the right tip can be as important as having the right pressure gauged on your sprayer.,
Thin the paint.,
Strain your paint.,
Set up the siphon hose.An airless sprayer draws paint from a hose.,
Prime the pump.All airless sprayers require priming before they're ready for use.,
Give your sprayer a quick check before each use.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer1," Larger tips generally require more pressure, but can cover more ground effectively. Narrower tips, on the other hand, are best for precision work. If you're unsure about the sort of tip you should be using, contact a hardware professional and give her the details of your project.;
, Latex paint works for airless sprayers, but it must first be thinned out in order to flow easily through the nozzle.Add 1/4 cup of water or chemical thinner for every gallon of paint you're using, then mix the two together thoroughly. You may have to experiment with different thicknesses of paint. Load some into your paint sprayer and check the coverage. If it's not spraying evenly, you may need to add more thinner.


Latex paint is the default paint for airless sprayers.
Chemical thinners are available from paint and hardware stores as well. These work more effectively than water and don't work against the paint's default properties.
The type of paint you use for your project will depend on the surface.

, No matter how well you mix the paint, there may still be little clumps of solid paint. It doesn't take much to clog an airless sprayer nozzle. Take a strainer and strain your paint into another bucket, catching the solid bits and discarding them.

, Attach your siphon hose to the back and place it gently in your paint bucket. It's a good idea to do this prior to priming. That way, you'll be able to tell priming is done because paint will start coming through the nozzle.

, Luckily, this is a fairly straightforward operation, as many airless sprayers will have a ""Prime"" setting. If your airless sprayer isn't priming successfully, it may help to give the device a slight tap with a hammer.This can loosen any clogged paint inside the sprayer.


Keep the nozzle face downward in a bucket to account for paint drips while you're getting the sprayer ready.

, Making sure your sprayer's in working order before you use it can help prevent big messes. Check the hose for microfractures. Check the nozzle and make sure the filter is clear. Give the paint a quick test run on a surface to make sure the paint's being distributed evenly.

Spend some extra time on your homework.,
Turn your work in on time.,
Ask about making up missed assignments.,
Ask to re-do old assignments.,
Prioritize.",How to Bring Up Your Grade Near the End of the Semester2," If you have been getting poor grades on homework assignments, it's time to up your game and put a little more effort into them. Even if each assignment is not worth that much, your cumulative grade for homework can be a big chunk of your final grade.Be sure you understand what you are supposed to do before you leave class. If you have any questions about how to complete the homework assignment, ask your teacher for clarification.
Always read the directions (or listen to them) and follow them precisely. Don't be lazy and write fewer words than were asked of you or neglect to show your work.

, Always write down when each assignment is due and hand it in on time. There's nothing worse than getting points off for handing in an assignment late because you forgot that it was due!If keeping track of your assignments in a planner or a digital calendar helps keep you organized, then be sure to record all of your homework assignments there.
Try planning out a specific time to complete each assignment, and be sure to take other obligations into consideration. For example, if you know that you have a basketball game on Thursday and will only have one hour to work on homework, don't put off any assignments until Thursday that can be completed on Wednesday.

, If you missed any assignments because you were absent or because you simply didn't do them, ask your teacher if you can hand them in late. While you may only get partial credit for make-up work, it's definitely better than having a zero for that assignment.


Ask about the possibility of making up in-class assignments that you missed as well as homework. Offer to come to the classroom during lunchtime or a free period to work on them.

, Try asking your teacher to revise an essay, re-take a test, or re-do a project that you got a bad grade on. You could suggest that the teacher could replace the grade or average the two grades together. Your teacher may be willing to let you do this if you seem committed to bringing your grade up.


Try to focus on substantive assignments that have a bigger impact on your overall grade rather than smaller assignments such as homework that may not make as big of a difference.

, While you may want to do whatever you can to improve a specific grade, it's important to be smart about it. Do not bring up one grade at the expense of another, whether it's for the same class or another one.


Focus the majority of your energy on the assignments that will earn you the most points. For example, if your final project is worth 50% of your grade and your homework assignments are worth 10%, spend more time studying for the final than working on your homework. This does not mean you should not do your other work, but simply that you should not spend as much time on it.Never neglect a current assignment in favor of make-up work unless you are sure that you will earn more points for it.
Don't neglect your other classes either. You shouldn't end up with a bad grade in one class because you were focusing all of your energy on trying to improve your grade in another. This will have a negative effect on your overall GPA.

Determine whether or not you will have to pay PMI after purchasing a home.,
Weigh the pros and cons of paying a smaller down payment to paying PMI.,
Make PMI payments on a monthly basis as part of your mortgage payment.,
Request a cancellation of PMI once your outstanding mortgage balance is less than 80 percent of the original home value.

,
Expect the lender to automatically terminate PMI payments according to federal law, in the following two situations:


Enough money has been applied to the principal to cause the loan value to reach 78 percent of the home value (or 77 percent of the home value for high-risk loans).",How to Understand Private Mortgage Insurance,"


The home value is based on the appraised value at the time of purchase. In the unlikely event that the home is purchased for more than the appraised value, the lower purchase price is used as the home value.
If the amount you are putting down is less than 20 percent of the value of the home, you will be required to pay PMI. For example, if you are paying $10,000 up front on a home that appraised for $200,000, you will have to pay PMI.;
, For example, putting less down might allow you to buy a home sooner, buy a more expensive home and/or invest more money in improvements. You should know what the estimated PMI payment will be to help you make the best decision. It is typically $50 to $100 a month.

, PMI is not normally handled as a separate payment to your lender.

,,
You have reached the midpoint of your amortization schedule. For example, on a 30-year loan, your PMI would be dropped after 180 of the 360 payments are made.

Disconnect the hose from the brake system.,
Remove any brackets or bolts along the flexible line.,
Remove the hose from the brake caliper or wheel cylinder.,
Attach the new hose to the brake caliper or wheel cylinder.,
Attach the new hose to the brake system.,
Bleed the brakes.",How to Change Brake Lines1," The flexible hose will most likely be a rubber hose (sometimes it may be braided steel) leading from the central brake line to the caliper piston in disc brakes or the wheel cylinder in drum brakes. To disconnect the hose, you should remove the retainer clip between the hose and the steel line. Next, you can turn the connector with a wrench until it comes loose.








Do not crank too much on these connections. If you do you may bend the metal brake lines and then have to replace them as well. Instead, drain the line by cutting the brake hose and use a torch to heat the connection. This will break it loose and you can remove it.;
, The brake hose may be mounted to the strut or another sturdy point between the central line and the wheel. You will need to locate any such connections by tracing the line from end to end. Loosen and remove any mounting connections you find.







, Now that the hose is disconnected from the lines to the master cylinder, you need only remove it from the brake itself. To do this you need to loosen the bolt found at the end of the brake line (known as a banjo bolt). This is often done with a 14mm socket or wrench, but the size can vary depending on make and model. There is also a washer on either side of the brake line (between the line and banjo bolt and the line and brake) that needs removed.







, To attach the new brake hose, you will simply reverse the steps you took to remove the original. This means putting the washers in first, then tightening the banjo bolt at the end of the brake hose.







, First, attach the retainer clip. This holds the brake hose in place while you make the connection and is usually attached by sliding it into the appropriate holder at the end of the brake hose. Next, fasten the connector between the brake hose and lines leading the the master cylinder. This should be done with a wrench or flare nut wrench. You should also reconnect any brackets that hold the line secure (often found on the struts or other steering component).







, Bleeding the brakes is necessary to remove air that you have introduced into your brake line. Open up the bleeder cap found on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder and have someone pump the brake to force the air out of the bleeder cap. Wait until you see fluid coming out of the bleeder cap, and then close the cap.








There are also pressure bleeders and gravity bleeders available for bleeding brakes."

If your dog is poorly trained this process will the doomed from the start. At a minimum your dog should reliably obey commands to sit, stay, lie down, heel, and come when called. If he or she does not, it is strongly advised that you Teach Your Dog Basic Commands before you continue.

, If you have ever watched a professional dog trainer at work, you have probably seen them use a clicker.The sound a clicker makes is called a reward marker. It tells your dog, “what you just did was great, and you’re going to get a treat for it!” This ensures that she understands exactly what behavior she is being rewarded for. You can use the word “yes” (or another word of your choosing) if you prefer, but a clicker is the most effective tool, because it is a sound your dog is unlikely hear in any other context. This is relatively simple to teach, and if you follow the instructions in the article Clicker Train Your Dog, your dog should figure it out pretty quickly.

, It is one of the most useful tools you can have in your obedience arsenal, however. It will enable you to stop your dog from engaging in dangerous, destructive, or generally unwanted behavior, and will be invaluable in teaching him or her to interact safely with a cat. As with any behavior, you will need to start simple, then gradually introduce elements of difficulty as your dog masters the basic concept."

Obtain horseradish crowns or roots to plant.,

Make sure the plant gets plenty of sunlight.,
Water the horseradish once or twice a week.,
Fertilize as needed.,
Prune suckers and weeds from the plant.,
Wait until late fall to harvest horseradish.,
Loosen the soil around the roots and remove the plant.,
Cut away small sections of horseradish to use or store.,
Replant roots sections to keep the plant growing.",How to Grow Horseradish," Purchase a cutting of horseradish from a greenhouse or grocery store. Most of the time, these places will sell crowns (the uppermost part of the plant) or roots that are pre-cut and ready to plant. Most gardeners start horseradish from crowns, as the plant grows from the roots and only its weed-like flowers produce seeds.Like carrots or potatoes, horseradish roots are ready to go straight into the ground.;
, Set aside an area in the corner of your garden to plant the horseradish crop, or designate a unique space such as a barrel or hanging planter to keep it from overtaking other plants. Horseradish takes roots quickly and flourishes in cool conditions, and it can quickly spread throughout your garden if you don’t check its growth.Horseradish is a perennial, so plant it somewhere you'd like to have it growing for years to come.
If you are working with a smaller garden, look into alternative planting methods such as terracing or using contained planting methods like a half barrel or Smart Pot., Loosen the soil about 12 inches deep where you decide to plant the horseradish. Make the hole wide enough to accommodate the entire length of the root, as it should be planted at an angle. Space the horseradish 18-20 inches (46-51 centimeters) away from the nearest plant so that the roots have plenty of room to spread and grow.







, Place the horseradish crown or root into the hole at roughly a 45 degree angle, with the thinner, bottom portion of the root slanted down. This will allow the roots to radiate out beneath the soil while keeping the leaves of the crown vertical above ground. Fill the hole with a shovelful of compost to act as a fertilizer.








Horseradish roots can be buried completely, or you can leave the top of the root visible to track its development.

, Horseradish should ideally be grown somewhere open with ample sun exposure, but a slightly shaded area is also acceptable. Unlike more temperamental plants, horseradish doesn’t require direct sunlight to thrive, although it will help it grow faster. Avoid planting horseradish near walls or fences or beneath trees that might strangle root growth.Horseradishes are perennial plants, so they will come back every year.

, Horseradish roots are very good at retaining moisture and therefore only require watering once or twice throughout the week. Water horseradish plants more frequently in the hot summer months when the soil tends to be drier. Be careful not to overwater horseradish, as this is one of the few conditions that can be harmful to its survival.When watering horseradish, it’s only necessary to keep the soil around the roots slightly damp. Don’t drown them.

, Fertilize during the spring with a high-phosphorus, low-nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilizing is optional, as the compost you used to plant the horseradish should provide sufficient nourishment, but can help the roots grow larger. Keep an eye on the progress of developing horseradish plants and use a fertilizer if the plants’ growth seems stunted or if soil health is poor.Do not fertilize more than once per growing season: in the case of horseradish, once a year in the springtime.

, As the horseradish grows, it will begin to sprout tall leaves known as “suckers” and various types of weeds. Keep these pruned down to prevent them from spreading. A healthy horseradish plant should have only 3-4 leaf stalks—any more may cause unintended spreading and irregular shaped roots should they be allowed to continue growing.Horseradish weeds can also spread undesirably to other plants.
Some weeds take the form of tall, spiked stalks that grow white flowers. This is a common sign that the horseradish has survived the harshest winter weather., A cold-hardy vegetable, horseradish reaches its peak in size and flavor after it has been through a frost, so wait until late fall to harvest horseradish crops. It usually takes around one year for a horseradish plant to reach maturity after its initial planting, so if you first planted the root in fall it should be ready to harvest by the following fall.The growing season for horseradish is one year from fall to fall.
A harsh frost will often kill off the foliage that grows at the crown of the plant. This is a good way to know when the horseradish is ready to be pulled., Use a shovel or trowel to gently loosen the soil beneath the plant’s leaf stalks. Once the root is visible, take hold of it and pull until the entire root system has been removed. Fully-grown horseradish plants will be between 6-10 inches in length, so dig deep to keep from damaging the root.








Accidentally severing any part of the root may result in unwanted growth and spreading.

, Snip away the green leaf stalks on the horseradish crown. These can be thrown away or used as compost. Cut the horseradish into small, thin sections that can easily be used later for cooking or other purposes. Unused horseradish can be stored in a plastic sandwich bag and will keep in the refrigerator for 3 months or longer.








If you know you want to continue growing horseradish, let a few root segments remain in the soil when you harvest.
Wash and dry horseradish roots thoroughly before using them to prepare food.

, If you decide to replant the harvested horseradish, cut the plant roughly 3-4 inches beneath the crown (around the root’s midpoint) and return the root portion to the soil, keeping the crown portion to use in the kitchen. The roots will reestablish themselves on their own, and you can resume regular watering and weeding.




Although the crown of the horseradish can produce a new plant, best results will be achieved by replanting the root system.
If you don’t want the horseradish plant to return after a harvest, you’ll need to make sure that all traces of the plant’s roots have been removed from the soil. Otherwise, they will continue to take up growing."

Use prescription-strength bleaching creams.,
Treat your sunspots with retinoids.",How to Prevent Sun Spots on Skin2," Fade cream may help reduce the darkness of sunspots, though cream won't necessarily erase them. The effectiveness of fade cream will depend on the darkness of the sunspots and the frequency with which you use fade cream. Most people who see results use fade cream consistently over a period of several weeks or even months.Common ingredients in fade cream that have been proven to help treat sunspots include:


Hydroquinone (may cause skin irritation and discoloration)Glycolic acid (may lead to skin tightness, redness, and irritation)Kojic acid

, Prescription skin-lightening creams like hydroquinone can be used to fade the brown sunspots on your skin.These creams can be used alone or in combination with other topical skin treatments.Many dermatologists combine bleaching creams with a mild steroid to increase their effectiveness.
Be aware that these creams may cause temporary redness and irritation of the skin, and could potentially cause permanent bleaching of the skin., Retinoids are derived from vitamin A, and studies suggest these topical treatments can help improve a variety of skin conditions.Tretinoin and other retinoids may be able to help reduce sunspots and other skin damage that was caused by UV radiation.Be aware that retinoid use may cause your skin to get dry, red, and irritated, and may result in peeling skin."

Navigate carefully in watercraft.,
Avoid touching corals in the wild.,
Take care when snorkeling and diving.,
Consider staying away completely.",How to Take Action to Save Coral Reefs3," Get charts ahead of your visit that show where the coral reefs are located. Avoid disturbing them with fishing gear, anchors, or high speed motoring. The best time to navigate watercraft in coral-rich areas is when the sun is high in the sky, making the coral easy to see. You can also try wearing polarized sunglasses to help see the coral in the water.Be mindful of where you drop anchor when boating. Coral is easily broken by anchors and boats, and breakage can lead to the coral’s death., Reefs are a wonderful place to dive and explore, but coral polyps, the living animals which make up coral, are very fragile. When scuba diving or snorkeling, make sure not to kick the coral, stand or sit on it, or even hold it in your hand. You could potentially cause great damage, even without intending to.Simply the oil in your skin can be damaging to coral. It might be tempting to reach out and touch the coral to see what it feels like, or just for the experience, but doing so could be detrimental to the coral.

, Aside from just being careful about touching or kicking the coral when diving, you need to be careful about what you bring in the water with you. Even the sunscreen you put on your skin before entering the water could ultimately be harmful to the coral. Try choosing a sunscreen that is eco-friendly, or a sunscreen that reflects the sun rather than absorbing it.Be mindful of any gear you have with you. If you are taking underwater photos, for example, keep your gear close to you and don’t let it knock into the coral. Keep your fins in mind when snorkeling. Make sure you don’t hit the coral with them while kicking and swimming. Stay high above the coral and observe it from near the surface., The one true method of preventing accidental damage to coral reefs is to not dive or swim near them at all. It might not be the most ideal option, especially for tourists or travellers who desire an up close and personal experience, but it might be one of the only ways to keep reefs completely safe from damages caused by tourists and visitors.

Practice where you need it and maintain the areas in which you are already flexible.

, There is no set limit of time or specific day to stretch. You can do it when you wake up, go to sleep, or simply during commercial breaks when you're watching television. Just be sure to stretch each day, or you risk losing flexibility., If you know a friend who is practically a master gymnast, ask for tips on how to stay motivated and get them to work with you daily until you achieve your goals.

, Gently tilt your head to one side then roll it down in a circular motion, sweeping from one side, toward your chest, and to the other side. Then roll your neck back so you are looking up at the ceiling or sky, and sweep it back to the starting position., Do this stretch standing up, and stick your arm out with your forearm pointing up at a 90 degree angle. Hold a broomstick in your hand so that it rests behind your elbow. Use your other hand to pull the bottom of the broomstick forward., It’s important to stretch your shoulders and upper chest as a gymnast. Sit on the floor and put your arms behind you with your fingers facing the rear. Straighten your arms as you slide your hands away from your body. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly walk your hands forward., Put one arm behind your head and bend it at the elbow. Use your other arm to gently pull your elbow toward your head. Repeat on the other side., Stand straight up and keep your knees and legs straight. Bend over and touch your toes or the ground. Keep your back and neck straight, and bend at the waist. This stretches your back and legs as well., Stand a few feet away from the wall and place your hands on the wall behind your head by bending backward. Walk yourself down to the ground., Back bends stretch out your back muscles and help you become more flexible. Lay on your back and reach your arms over your head, placing your hands on the ground by your ears. Push your body up so that your weight is on both your hands and feet and your torso is in a bridge.For an added challenge, straighten your legs, rather than leaving them bent at the knee.
You can also walk your legs in and rock back and forth.
For advanced gymnasts, try to move your arms in toward your head and rest your weight on your forearms, rather than your hands.

, Lay on your back and bring your knees in toward your tummy. Hold your legs with your arms so that you are curled up in a ball. Rock back and forth to stretch your back muscles., Lay flat on your tummy then use your arms to hold your torso up. Tip your head back. This stretches your chest, abdominal, and back muscles. A snake or cobra stretch is another name for this pose.If that stretches your muscles too far, support your body with your elbows and forearms and work up to using your hands to support your weight.

, This stretches out your hip flexors and legs. Start with one knee bent, with your foot on the floor, and the other leg stretched out behind you on the floor. Raise your arms above your head.To stretch further, lean back so the leg that was bent is now straight out in front of you, and the other leg is bent at the knee and rests under your body. Lean forward and stretch your arms in front of you.
You can also bend your front leg, while keeping your back leg straight. Sit on the ground and reach forward to touch your toes.

, Start by sitting on the ground with your legs spread out in front of you. Open your legs as wide as you can but keep your knees and legs straight. Keep your back straight and lean over to one side to touch your toes. Repeat on the other side.You can also reach out in front of you with your arms and try to touch the ground.

, Sit on the ground and stretch your legs out in front of you. Point your toes and keep your legs together. Reach over with your arms and touch your toes.Then, flex your feet, reach over and grab your toes, and try to pull your heels off the ground.

, Sit on the ground and bend your knees to the sides so that the bottoms of your feet are touching. Gently press down on your knees to stretch your hips. You can also lean over and reach your arms out in front of you so that they touch the floor., Ask a friend to help you stretch your legs. Lay on your back and lift one leg in the air, bringing it toward your body but keeping the leg straight. Have a friend push your leg gently toward your body. When it starts to hurt, push back against your friend’s hands. Then, relax your muscles and your leg should stretch further. Repeat with the other leg."

This isn't something you can just pickup and 'wing'. Bleaching hair has many risks and dangers associated with it. You'll want to minimise these so make sure you get professional quality products made especially for this task. Quality shows with bleach. Many can tell a box blonde from a professional blonde, it's all aesthetic..


If your hair is darker *darker than a medium brown - black* you will need to use 30 vol. or 40 vol. peroxide, 40 isn't recommended especially on the scalp, but if you're going for an ombre or a balayage look 40 is good for getting a nice degree of lift in a short period of time.
If your hair is lighter than light brown use 20 vol.or 30 vol.
You will get away with 10 volume if you're naturally light blonde.;

Ask them to help you choose a space and set it up. You will probably also need their help to pay for some of your new equipment.


Your parents are more likely to say yes if you have a plan for your science space. Tell them the types of things you would like to do with the space to convince them that it is a good idea.;
, You want to make sure the space is big enough for the types of experiments you will be doing. Choose a room or a corner of the room that has enough space for a table and chairs. Mark this area specifically as the “science lab” and keep all of the science experiment supplies in this space.


Dedicate an area of the playroom to the “lab” and set up boundaries using bookshelves as walls.Use an old table that can be damaged without consequences.

, If possible, set up your lab near a window. A well-lit space allows you to see what you are doing during the experiment. It can be dangerous working in a poorly-lit space. If the overhead lighting is not sufficient, consider purchasing a floor or table lamp to increase the light in the area.This will be particularly helpful if you are doing experiments involving the weather or plants that need sunlight., Another reason to set up your lab near the window is to provide good ventilation. Some of your experiments may get smelly or may produce potentially harmful fumes. Working in a space with good air circulation is important in these instances.You can use a fan to help circulate the air with the window open during the experiment.

, Even if you are being super careful, it is likely that you will spill something during your experiments. If the room you are setting everything up in has carpet, consider getting a plastic mat to place under the workspace to make cleanup easier.In a pinch, you can lay down plastic bags or newspaper during the experiment and clean it all up when you’re finished.

, You definitely want to have a fire extinguisher and first aid kit in an easily accessible place. It is best if you can set up your lab near a sink or bathroom. Having running water nearby makes the lab space that much safer in case of emergency.


Have a cleaning kit for spills and decontamination nearby as well.

, A true home scientist must also be a safe home scientist. Safety goggles, a lab coat, and gloves are three essentials to any laboratory.You may not need them for every experiment, but it is good to get in the habit of putting your protective equipment on to stay safe.


These items can be purchased at education stores or online.
Lab coats will also keep your clothes from getting damaged during the experiment.

, There are many kits for kids that have all the basics included in one box. There are kits specific to different subjects as well. It all depends on what you’re interested in. The kits are a good place to start to gather materials needed for future experiments.


Some of the components of these kits are reusable so be sure to save them.

, Test tubes, beakers, flasks, and measuring devices are all necessary for the home scientist. Glassware can easily be purchased online. You can use measuring cups like the ones in the kitchen or you can purchase a graduated cylinder to help measure volumes.A scale for weighing things can also be useful.
With some creativity, you can use a lot of items around the house for your experiments. Old soda bottles, cans, and take out containers can be very useful.

, Every good scientist keeps track of the experiments that they have done. When you are working on something, take notes in your lab notebook. Make sure to include the date you were working and everything you did. Write down your results as well.


If you took pictures, be sure to include those in your notebook.

, When organizing your lab space, you want to make sure that the table you will be working on is always clear. You will need lots of space for your experiments and you don’t want the bench to be cluttered with items.


When doing experiments, keep only the things you’ll need on the bench space. Leave everything else stored away.

, Make a dedicated space for all of your lab equipment. This will make it easier to find when you need it later. Keep a set of plastic drawers or a bookshelf near your work bench to make things easily accessible.Return everything to its spot when you’re done with the experiment.

, When you are finished working in your lab, make sure you put everything away and clean your bench space. If anything was spilled, clean it up. Wash all of the containers you used and put them away as well.If your lab coat got messy, take it off and have it washed.

, SLI requires a motherboard with multiple PCI-Express slots, as well as a power supply with enough connectors for multiple graphics cards. You will want a power supply that outputs at least 800 watts.


Certain cards allow up to four simultaneous cards running in SLI. Most cards are made for two-card setups.
More cards means more power required.

, Almost all recent NVidia cards are capable of being installed in an SLI configuration. You will need at least two cards of the same model and memory to be installed as SLI.


The cards do not need to be the same manufacturer, just the same model and memory amount.
The cards do not need to be the same clock speed, though you may see a decrease in performance output if the speeds are not the same.
For best results, use two identical cards.

, Install the two cards in the PCI-E slots on your motherboard. The graphics cards are inserted into the slots as normal. Take care not to break any tabs, or insert the cards at odd angles. Once the cards are inserted, secure them to the case with screws.

, All SLI-capable boards should come packaged with an SLI bridge. This connector attaches to the top of the cards, and connects the cards to each other. This allows the cards to talk directly to each other.


The bridge is not required for SLI to be enabled. If there is no bridge present, the SLI connecting will be made through the PCI slots of the motherboard. This will result in reduced-performance.

, Once you have your graphics cards installed, close up your case and reboot your computer. You shouldn’t need to make any settings changes until after Windows or Linux loads.

, Your operating system should automatically detect your graphics cards and attempt to install drivers for them. This process can take longer than a single graphics card installation because the drivers need to be installed for each card separately.If the installation doesn’t start automatically, download the latest drivers from the NVidia website, and run the installation file once the download is complete.

, Once your drivers have finished installing, right-click on your desktop and select NVidia Control Panel. This will open a new window which will allow you to tweak your graphic’s settings. Find the menu option labeled “Configure SLI, Surround, Physx”.


Select “Maximize 3D performance” and click Apply.
The screen will flash several times as the SLI configuration is enabled. You will be asked if you want to keep these settings.
If the option is not there, your system is most likely not recognizing one or more of your cards. Open the Device Manager in the Control Panel and check that all of your drives are visible under the Display Adapters section. If your cards are not showing up, check that they are connected properly, and that the drivers have been installed for all of them.

, Click the Manage 3D Settings link in the left menu. Under Global Settings, scroll down until you find the “SLI performance mode” entry. Change the settings from “Single GPU” to “Alternate Frame Rendering 2”. This will turn on SLI mode for all of your programs.


You can make adjustments to individual games by clicking the Program Settings tab and then selecting “SLI performance mode”.

, This will vary depending on the game you are running, so you will need to look up the specific instructions for the game you want to test. Frames per second is a baseline test for computing power, and can show you have well everything is being rendered. Most gaming enthusiasts shoot for a solid 60 frames per second with high settings.

, In the NVidia Control Panel, open the “3D Settings” menu. Enable the “Show SLI Visual Indicators” option. This will create a bar on the left side of your screen.Run your game. Once you have a game running, you will see the bar change. A taller bar means that SLI scaling is increasing, meaning that your SLI cards are working well and improving your visuals. If the bar is not very tall, then the SLI configuration is not affecting the display as much.

Purchase Tyvek FlexWrap.,
Check the slope.,
Clean the sill.,
Cut the FlexWrap.,
Apply primer in certain conditions.,
Lay out the FlexWrap.,
Stretch and fasten the FlexWrap over the corners.,
Make adjustments while install the window or door.",How to Install Tyvek2," This is a Tyvek product that can easily be stretched to cover the corners of window and door openings. Choose a width, typically 7–9 inches (18–23 cm) that can easily cover the sill and provide a couple inches (several centimeters) of overlap. While ordinary Tyvek wrap is typically cheaper, it will not provide as durable and effective a water barrier for window sills.








, The windowsill should be level or sloped slightly outward, to provide adequate drainage. If it is sloped inward or sloped severely in either direction, install a sloped sill pan before continuing.







, Wipe the sill and surrounding surfaces with a dry cloth to remove all moisture, grease, dust, and frost from the area.







, Cut the FlexWrap at least 12 in. (30 cm) longer than the sill surface. This extra space ensures the entire sill will still be covered once the Tyvek FlexWrap is stretched around it and fastened.








, Primer is only necessary in areas of severe weather conditions, severe cold temperatures, or certain building materials. Apply primer if the sill is made from concrete, masonry, or fiber-faced exterior gypsum board. DuPont, the manufacturer of Tyvek, recommends using a DuPont-approved primer for this purpose, such as the following:








SIA 655 or Perma-grip 105 (Henkel)
Hi-Strength 90 (made by 3M)
Butyl Primer (Denso)

, Place the Tyvek FlexWrap over the sill, so it completely covers the base and hangs over the surrounding vertical sides. Do not stretch the Tyvek while laying it across the sill. Smooth it out with your hand or a roller to make it flat and even.








, Hold the FlexWrap in place over the sill, then pull one corner to stretch it onto the surrounding wall surface. Use a staple, washer head nail, or other fastener to attach the FlexWrap over the wall. Repeat for the remaining corners.








, Follow the window or door manufacturer's instructions for installation. However, make sure not to caulk the FlexWrap base of the sill. After installation, you can provide additional protection by installing FlexWrap strips over the exterior jambs (sides), then cover them with a strip over the head (top) of the window.

Pay attention when pulling out of parking lots.",How to Adjust to Driving a Car on the Left Side of the Road," Learning what type of car you are going to drive is important. If you are taking a trip where you’ll be driving on the left side of the road, then you are probably renting a car. Call the rental company ahead of time and find out if they have both manual and automatic. Even if you are used to driving stick, considering renting an automatic to make the adjustment easier.If you are only familiar with one method, it’s best to try and stick to that so you are only learning one new thing at a time.
Also consider finding out about, if possible, what specific car you will be driving (its make and model), to help you get a feel for how it will drive.
Many countries that have left-driving roads tend to have more manual cars than automatic, so you may have to pay more to rent an automatic car.;
, If you are learning to adjust to driving on the left side of the road, you are most likely in a country that you are not familiar with. Learning this new way of driving in a city with heavy traffic can add to the stress of the situation, so it is helpful whenever possible to pick up your car in a more rural location.You may have to pick a different rental company, or see if they will deliver the car to wherever you are. The benefit of this is that you will have more open roads to get used to rather than densely packed cities with tight streets.
If you can’t pick it up a distance outside the city, see if you can pick it up close to the edge rather than the middle, so that way you can head out of the city immediately.

, Once you are in the driver’s seat, you should take some time to get acquainted with the setup up and functions of the car. The shifter is going to be on your left side now instead of the right side. The turn signals, windshield wipers, and headlight controls may be on the opposite side of the steering wheel as they were before. Testing these controls before you drive is absolutely necessary.Even in cars with the driver’s seat on the right side of the car, the brake and accelerator are in the same position as left side driver’s seat cars. Still, your right leg will be against the door rather than against the middle console or in the open. Get used to the feel of having your right leg against the door.

, Roundabouts are a frequent part of driving in European countries that use left-lane driving. You’ll still see some traffic lights, but you already know how to handle those. Roundabouts may be a bit more challenging, even if you have driven them in your home country. The added difficulty of the driving on the left can make them a little more daunting. Roundabouts are designed to be safer than traffic lights and they allow traffic to keep slowing rather than stop completely.Always yield to those people already driving in the roundabout. They have the right of way.
You have to pick the lane you want to use and stay in that lane until you exit the roundabout. Look for signs before entering the roundabout that direct which lane you should use, if the roundabout has multiple lanes. The lane more to the right is essentially for those who are making a right turn. The left lane, then, is for those who are using one of the three or more other roadways.
The main thing to remember at first is just to slow down and be cautious until you get the hang of the roundabout. Try to watch the other traffic and mimic what they are doing.

, On roads with one two lanes, one going in each direction, you always want to pay attention to how wide the roadway is and stay close to the outside. Sometimes you may have to inch off the road a little to allow other cars to pass you.This can be especially tricky on streets that have cars parked on the sides. Sometimes you will need to pull off to the side and stop and let a car from the opposite direction go past first. Likewise, locals will often let you go past as well.

, Some countries have local customs that can include breaking traffic laws. Red lights may be discretionary, and if a driver sees that no one is coming they may pass through the red light anyway. You still want to know the laws, but you can begin to adapt to the local practices by paying attention. Still, you are the only one who has your safety and best interest in mind, so being over-cautious and defensive while you drive is probably still best., When you are learning to do almost anything, slowing down is usually pretty helpful, and this is definitely true when adjusting to a new way of driving. Since you will be looking at the road from a new vantage point, it’s possible that your reaction time will be a little slower than it was before. If you are driving fast, then this will only make your slow reactions seem worse.


Don’t be afraid to go slower while you get the feel of this new way of driving. People may get up close behind you, so it’s not a bad idea every so often to pull off to the side and let those people go past you. It is better to have a few people angry at you and to take more time on your drive than to go faster than you can handle and cause an accident.

, A lot of drivers tend to get in the groove of driving and often let themselves multitask or pay attention to more than the road while they drive. You may be used to adjusting the stereo system, looking at your phone to text or navigate, reaching behind you to find something in the back seat, or eating a quick lunch on your commute. Don’t do all that. Focus on the road.Consider whether or not you think you might need to do these things and specifically do them before you get going.
It can also be a good idea to forego listening to music at all on your first driving trip.

, You most likely don’t know the roads when you are starting to drive on the left side, so it can be really helpful to learn the basics of the drive you are about to make.Before you start your drive, study the map and try to have a good idea of where you are going. If it is possible to set audio navigation on either your phone, the car itself, or a gps system, this is a good idea. Having the route clearly defined will free you up to focus only on driving.

, If at all possible when learning to drive on the left, it is good to have another passenger along for the ride who can help you remember to stay on the left side of the road. They can also watch the center line and help you make sure you are not drifting too close to or completely over it. They can also act as navigator and help you watch for signs and other drivers. Obviously this will not always be possible, but it’s a great help if you can manage it.


Having someone else with is also really helpful when you go to park for the first time. You may very well have to parallel park, which tends to be easier if you have someone who can guide you.
Plus, if you are particularly nervous about making this driving adjustment, having someone to talk to and keep you calm will be invaluable.

, If you are used to driving on the right side of the road, then pulling right out of a parking lot means pulling into the lane that is closest to you. On roadways where you drive on the left, now pulling out to the right means you are crossing oncoming traffic. Make sure you check to your right (the oncoming lane) before pulling out into the left lane.This also means that pulling out left means you will pull into the left lane closest to you, assuming the road only has two lanes. This will feel unsettling at first, so just take an extra breath and an extra look to remind yourself what you are doing.
When you are getting used to this, deliberately look at the roadway a couple extra times to firmly remind yourself where you are at in traffic and whether or not you are crossing oncoming traffic to get to your lane.

Choose a stick deodorant.,
Wash your armpits.,
Dress first.,
Unwind or pull off the deodorant cap.,
Remove plastic casing.,
Apply deodorant evenly to the underarm region.,
Replace the cap and put the deodorant away.",How to Apply Stick Deodorant," Go shopping and decide which brand of stick deodorant and which fragrance is best for you.


If you are buying stick deodorant for work or playing sports, you might want to consider an unscented deodorant to avoid offending anybody with a strong fragrance.
Read the label to make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients.;
, Before applying the stick deodorant, either take a shower or wash your armpits thoroughly to freshen up. Dry with a towel so that the deodorant will roll onto your skin smoothly without smearing.

, Deodorant is known to streak on clothes, therefore, it is better to roll the deodorant under your armpit after you get dressed.


Although this might wrinkle your clothes a little bit that is more acceptable than walking around all day with white streaks on your shirt.

, As with most cosmetic products, deodorant containers come with a tight cap that requires you to unwind it or pull it off.

, There is often a special seal located under the cap and firmly on top of the deodorant stick that needs to be removed before use.


The actual deodorant stick is made from alcohol, which needs to remain moist. A tight plastic casting keeps the stick moist and avoids evaporation.
Sometimes you need to turn the dial on the bottom of the deodorant container until the plastic cap pops off.

, Apply the deodorant at the center of your armpit, working your way outward in all directions until your underarm is completely covered. Reapply throughout the day as needed.


Raise the deodorant stick high enough above the container so that you do not rub your skin up against the protective plastic covering.
Make it easy on yourself by using the opposite hand to apply the deodorant to each of your armpits.

, Otherwise the stick will dry up without the cap on and you will no longer be able to use it.

Orient and load in the new deadbolt lock into the side of the door.,
Line up the tongues of both the interior and the exterior cylinders into the deadbolt controller.,
Screw in the screws on the interior of the door.,
Check that the deadbolt performs its job as advertised.",How to Change a Lock," This is usually printed on the latch, but can also be found on the key — useful if the plate has been painted over, or is a leftover from an old doorknob set. You won't need an exact replacement of your old lock, but knowing the brand, style, setback, and features of the old lock will help ensure that your new lock looks, fits, and works as advertised.


Replacing your lock with another of the same brand and basic style will help ensure that no modifications will have to be made to the door itself.;
, Often, front and back door locksets will be larger than interior locksets. Knowing in advance which size you need will save you headaches later.


Draw a tape measure from the latch edge of the door to the center of the doorknob or deadbolt lockset. Most contemporary locksets are either 2-3/8 inch (6cm) or 2-3/4 inch (6.5cm) diameter.
The bolt or latch in many new locksets are adjustable for both, but make sure before leaving your hardware store to keep from having to backtrack.
Older locksets may vary in size, but are generally smaller, requiring more extensive carpentry (and greater woodworking skills). If that's what you have, try checking vintage renovation stores for a ""new"" lockset.

, Release the springs holding the knob in place. The doorknob should come off easily, leaving you only with a decorative cover. If the springs on the knob cannot be accessed before removing the decorative cover, remove the interior cover first before removing the knob.

, The screws for the cover may or may not be visible once you remove the knob. If they are, simply remove them and set them aside. If they are not visible, look along the edge for a hole, where they sometimes hide an allen bolt. If there are no holes or hidden screws, the plate is simply snapped in place — use a thin flathead screwdriver to gently pry off the cover, exposing the locking mechanism.

, Remove the screws that secure the interior lock section to the exterior half. These are found on the inside half of the knob. Once both screws are removed, simply pull each half of the knob straight away from the door.


Don't let the door close or you will either have to re-insert the half of the knob with the ""blade"" on it or use a screwdriver or butter knife to unlatch it.

, Remove the two screws from the latch assembly on the side of the door. Remove the strike plate on the door jamb as well.


If your new lock is the same brand and model as the old one you may be able to keep your existing latch plate and strike plate. Hold the new plates up to the old and compare — if they're the same, it is better to leave the old ones in place if possible. Removing and replacing screws tends to weaken their hold in the door.
If you can't get the new screws to bite, you may have to shove a small splinter of wood (or two) into the screw hole and snap them off flush with the edge of the door (toothpicks work well for this).
Another alternative is to purchase longer screws, but make sure that the screw heads are identical to the ones provided by the manufacturer or they may not seat properly and cause problems.

, Chisel out any uneven recesses in the latch so that your new latch will fit perfectly. Place the new latch into the recess. If the new latch rests snugly into its recess, don't worry about adding the screws until the remaining parts of the lockset have been installed.


If the new latch has trouble staying put in its recess, fit the screws into the latch and then tighten down.

, Slide the outside parts of the lockset into the hole, through the latch assembly. Holding them roughly parallel to the floor, insert the inside set, sliding it onto blade of the outside part of the lockset. Insert the mounting screws, and tighten them down.


Make sure that the strike plate lines up with the new lock. If it doesn't, it's advisable to replace the strike plate.

, Test this with the door open. If something is amiss, you don't want to be locked out!

, Your new doorknob should be fairly springy, opening and closing with ease.

, This will allow you to have access to the interior of the deadbolt lock.

, A couple of quick turns using your Allen wrench (or hex key — they're the same thing) should be able to loosen the deadbolt mechanism from the inside. Remove the inside cylinder and outside cylinder.


If your deadbolt lock has decorative caps over the screws, use a punch and hammer to knock the caps off center and then grab them with pliers. Then use the Allen wrench to unscrew the mountings.

, This is not the best option, and it requires a strong drill bit, but it will help remove a deadbolt.


From the outside, drill into the cylinder in the middle of the deadbolt lock where the tumblers are found. Remove the tumblers.
Alternately, drill on both sides of the deadbolt, halfway between the top and bottom. Drill through on both sides until the exterior covering comes out.
Insert a screwdriver into the latch and turn the knob lock.

, Take the old deadbolt out and clean up any remaining debris or dust from the deadbolt recess.

, Make sure the top of the deadbolt is facing up. After lining it up, load in the deadbolt and fasten to the side of the door with two Phillips screws. Be careful not to over-tighten.


Once you've installed the deadbolt on the side of the door, use a screwdriver to test the functionality of the deadbolt.

, The tongues of both cylinders are flat on one side and curved on the other. Fit both tongues into the cylinder so that the flat sides are touching each other. For ease of installation, fit one cylinder in first, and then the other; fitting in both at the same time can be difficult.

, Screw in both screws and fasten tightly, but not so tight that the deadbolt is off-center.

, Fit your key into the deadbolt and turn. Look for a nice fluid turn. Check that the deadbolt is centered.

, For even baking, position the oven rack at the center of the oven and bake one sheet of cookies at a time.


If baking two sheets, it is recommended that you space the racks so as to divide the oven into thirds, then rotate the cookie sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through baking., It will take several minutes for the oven to heat up, so save time by preheating it before you start mixing the cookie dough.

, Place a piece of parchment or wax paper on the cookie sheets and set them off to the side. Lining the cookie sheets with wax paper will prevent the cookies from sticking during baking.

, Cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy.


If the butter is firm, use the tines of a fork to press it down into the sugar.
If the butter is cold or frozen, it won't mix properly. Thaw it to room temperature or heat it until softened.

, This is recommended each time a new ingredient is added.

, If you prefer cookies with a stronger vanilla taste, use 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.


Use a whisk or electric mixer to blend the ingredients in the bowl for about 1 minute or until smooth.

, Mix in each ingredient individually before adding the next ingredient.


Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula in between adding each ingredient.
Mix until the dough is a smooth, uniform texture.

, Use a large spoon to scoop balls of dough onto the cookie sheet.You can also grab the cookie dough with your fingers and roll it into a ball shape between your hands.


Clean your hands before handling the cookie dough.
If you prefer not to get your hands dirty, use two spoons to handle the dough.

, Your balls of dough will spread during baking. By placing the dough balls slightly apart, you won't have to worry about them spreading into each other.


Place the balls of dough a few inches apart.
Don't worry if the dough balls are slightly different in shape and size.

, Bake cookies for 10 minutes.


It is recommended that you rotate the baking sheet front to back after five minutes.
Always use a timer to avoid burning the cookies. To air on the side of safety, you can set a timer for 7 to 8 minutes, check the cookies visually, and adjust the cooking time as necessary.

, Once the cookies are golden brown on the edges, let them cool. The baking sheet will continue to cook your cookies as long as it is still hot from the oven. This is fine.


If preferred, use a spatula to gently lift the cookies into a cooling rack.

, Fill a serving dish for a party or wrap the cookies individually to share with friends.

, If you have a little extra time, you can create a creamy frosting to top the cookies. Assemble the following ingredients:


2 1/2 cup powdered sugar
2-3 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
3-4 tablespoon milk or water.

, In a medium sized bowl, mix the ingredients until evenly dispersed.,, It is recommended that you let the frosting sit to give it time to set.

If you'd like, you can add sprinkles.

, While there's nothing wrong with the classic vanilla cookie, you might enjoy trying something new.


When mixing the dough, stir in some different flavors, such as: white chocolate chips, coconut flakes, nuts. Or, experiment with some of your favorite nuts, berries or sweet treats.

, If you like, you can roll the cookie dough out with a rolling pin and use cookie cutters to create desired shapes for your cookies. This can be especially fun for the kids, and will take their mind off these being merely ""vanilla"".

Look at the coat colour.",How to Identify an Abyssinian Cat1," Abyssinians are slender and medium-sized. Their legs and tails are long, and they have a lean, muscular look, with a slight arch to the back. Their feet are oval shaped, and they seem almost to be standing on their toes at all times.Males usually weigh 8-10 lbs. (4-5 kg), while females usually are 6-7 lbs. (3 kg).;
, The head of an Aby is shaped like a wedge with a slight break at the muzzle, but their ears are the most striking feature. They are noticeably large and triangular; they are also forward-arched and alert, as if the cat is eager to hear everything. Additionally, an Aby’s eyes are distinctly almond shaped and can be copper, hazel, green, or gold., Abyssinians are shorthaired cats. Adult Abys have soft, fine, dense fur, lying close to their body. Their fur is short and ticked — that is to say, each hair has a light base, with three of four bands of colour, growing lighter towards the tip.Kittens are born with dark coats, but these lighten as they grow older.
These cats can also have light, faded blackish stripes around the face.

, The most common Abyssinian coat colour is ruddy, a warm, deep reddish brown. The ticking is black. Another common coat colour is chocolate; this is light brown. Sorrel, also known as red or cinnamon, is a light coppery base with chocolate brown ticking.


The officially recognized breed colours include ruddy, chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lilac, and fawn. There is also a “silver” variation for each colour, with this lighter colour appearing closest to the skin."

Determine when to add the blackberries.,
Purchase blackberry puree or juice for use in your beer.,
Add whole, fresh blackberries to your beer.,
Steep dried berries in the secondary fermenter.,
Add blackberry extract at bottling.",How to Make Blackberry Beer2," In most cases, you'll want to add the berries to your beer during secondary fermentation. If you add the fruit much later, the sugars will not undergo much fermentation. If you add the fruit any earlier, you run the risk of infecting the beer with the bacteria that are inevitably present on the berries.

, Perhaps the most common and straightforward way to add berries to a beer is by pouring fruit puree or juice directly into the secondary fermenter. This will give you a full blackberry flavor, but will also lend your beer a bluish purple color.

, If you have access to good quality fresh berries, you can add them to the secondary fermenter as well. Before adding them, freeze and thaw them to break up the berries' cells and release their juices. Steeping the berries in a cheesecloth bag will prevent you from having to filter skins and seeds out of your beer later.

, If you use dried berries, you can impart the full flavor of the fruit without turning the beer purple. You can dry the fruit yourself using a food dehydrator or purchase the dried fruit from the supermarket.

, If you want to bypass the trouble of steeping fruit in your secondary fermenter, you can purchase a small bottle of blackberry extract instead. This liquid can be added directly to your bottling bucket. Note that the flavor of fruit extracts is often thinner than the flavor from whole or pureed fruit.

Recognize the problem.,
Quit for yourself.,
Count the financial costs of your addiction.,
Find the source your addiction.,
Be honest with yourself.,
Make a primary choice and a continuous choice.",How to Stop Dipping1," Dipping may not seem as dangerous as cigarettes are to some people because no smoke is involved. However, dipping can cause cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus, as well as shrinking of the gums around your teeth, cracked lips, white spots, sores, bleeding in the mouth, tooth loss, bad breath, and increased risk for heart disease and stroke.;
, Make the decision to quit about you, not about someone else in your life. If you quit for someone else when you don't want to, you may resent them during the withdrawal process.


That being said, family members and friends can be a great support and inspiration for quitting dipping. Accept support from your loved ones.
Dipping can greatly impact not only your life but the lives of your family and friends.

, Realize that you are spending money to harm yourself. If you are chewing as often as one can per day, your addiction can get expensive very quickly. Try to view your addiction as an intense waste of money if that helps you recognize that you have a problem.


Your health insurance costs will also go up as a result of your chewing habit.
If you do contract a disease or cancer as a result of dipping, the cost of treatment will be enormous.

, You may not be able to remember when you chose to start dipping. In fact, it may not have been a conscious decision at all. Chances are, you did not plan to become a dipper, but somehow it happened and now you need to fix it.


Maybe your friends and/or family introduced you to dipping one day and you gradually accepted, eventually becoming comfortable with the substance and ultimately becoming addicted.
Maybe a certain behavior triggers a tobacco craving, such as playing in a baseball league with other dippers. Identify and avoid trigger behaviors and settings.

, Evaluate the facts of your situation, not how you feel about them. Your feelings are important, but they sometimes lead you to a false sense of reality.


When your mind tries to tell you that you cannot withhold a dip any longer, recognize that the truth is you will not die if you withhold a dip.
When your mind starts to make excuses, try to bring yourself back to the reality of the situation., Your primary choice consists of your long-term goal, which is that you are going to quit dipping. Your continuous choice is an immediate choice that you can revisit each day, such as ""I am not going to dip right now."""

Let the dogs out at alternate times so that they can pick up on each others scent around the house without a confrontation.The new dog should spend more time confined during the first few days, being let out for approximately 15-20 minutes, 3 or more times a day.

, Smell is the primary way for dogs to get to know each other and establish a sense of comfort with one another. Place objects from one dog (e.g. a toy or blanket) in the other's crate or bed so that it gets used to the unfamiliar scent. In the long run, the recognition of each other's scent may forge a bond between the dogs., During the initial period where your resident dog adjusts to the new dog’s presence, offer it as much comfort and attention as possible. Identifying an unfamiliar scent in its home without being able to confront the source will be confusing and unsettling, as your dog will likely suspect that there is an intruder in the home. Spend quiet time cuddling or petting it to keep it calm and make it feel secure.This kind of quality time will also help to curb jealously later on.

, If both dogs seem to have grown comfortable with each other’s presence, allow them to interact for a few short periods each day (5-10 minutes, or longer if the dogs get along well). Clear the area that you choose for these play sessions of any objects they might fight over (toys, dog blankets, food bowls, etc.). Monitor the interactions closely- if one of the dogs shows signs of aggression (e.g. staring at the other dog), remove it from the interaction and tell it to go lie down until it is calm.

, Create positive associations during your dogs’ first interactions so that your resident dog sees the new dog’s presence as something good. Use praise and a happy, upbeat tone of voice to address both dogs during this time. Reward both dogs with treats, being careful to give each dog the exact same treat at the same time to avoid jealously or fighting., Monitor your dogs very carefully while they play, watching for warning signals. Actions like moving to another part of the room are clear signs that a dog needs a break from the situation, and should be respected. Watch for other signs that could be mistaken for simple play, such as:Staring at another dog
A dog circling another dog with its neck arched, legs stiff, and tail high
A dog licking its lips or nose in an exaggerated manner, which is likely a signal that it is anxious or uncomfortable., During your dogs’ supervised interactions, look for indications that they are forging a bond. Such signs would include cuddling, increased play and interaction, or mutual grooming (e.g. licking each other). As time goes on the dogs should not avoid each other, as that is generally a sign of having incompatible pets., If your dogs do not get along after several attempts at play time and monitored interactions, contact an animal trainer for help regulating the problem behavior occurring. Avoid punishing either dog, which will result in further negative associations with the new living situation.

Avoid dwelling on the loss.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Has Changed," You might find that you’re not the only one having issues with a particular person.


Sharing your problems can make both of you feel better. Together, you might be able to determine the best course of action.
You don’t want to be accused of gossiping or talking behind your friend’s back, so seek the advice of just one mutual friend.;
, The direct approach is often the best one. If someone who was once a close friend has suddenly become distant, ask them if something is wrong.


If you feel that your relationship with someone has changed, chances are they have noticed a difference too, and will be willing to talk to you.
Try not to be accusatory or confrontational, just ask if they feel that something is wrong between you.You might say something like, ""Hey, it's been a while since we've talked. How are things? Is everything ok?""

, If a friend’s attitude toward you has changed radically, it might be a sign of a deeper problem like depression or bipolar disorder.If you really think that your friend might have a medical disorder, encourage them to seek professional advice., You don’t need to be pushy or insistent, simply let them know that you are concerned and would like to talk with them.

, This can set a positive tone for the conversation and soften your criticism of them.


If the issue is that you no longer see your friend, you might say, “I really liked when we used to spend time together, but lately it seems like you’ve been avoiding me.”
If you are still spending time together but their behavior has become hurtful, you might say something like, “You have a great sense of humor, but when you make fun of me it hurts my feelings.”
Use a specific example of a time that your friend’s behavior has upset you.Reassure them that you are still their friend. You might say, ""I will always be here for you, but I want to make sure that you're doing well.""

, Their reaction—even if it involves criticism of you—can be key to repairing your friendship., Taking responsibility can show someone that you care about how they feel., For example, if you and your friend first bonded by going to the movies, suggest an upcoming film to see together.

, If your friend’s interests have changed, try something new that they like to do. Ask them for ideas of fun activities. Keep an open mind. You might enjoy it!

, If your friend is hanging out with a new group of people, try to get along with them and become part of the new group.

, If you think you are both going to an upcoming party or other event, suggest that you will see them there, even if you’re not going together., This is a big step, but if someone is affecting your life negatively, limiting the time you spend together might be the best thing for both of you.If talking to your friend doesn’t work or they don’t want to see you, not being around them will be a natural result.
If you decide that you don’t want to spend time with a former friend, you may have to turn down their invitations and explain why you are doing so.

, If you have mutual friends, you will likely see this person again.


If you see a former friend in public, be polite but don’t pursue a one-on-one relationship with them if you don’t think it is a good idea., Moving on from a friendship can be difficult, so it is important to cultivate other, more positive relationships.


Spend time with your current friends who share your interests. Try doing activities that you enjoy with a new group of people.
Find ways to meet new people. You might take a class in a subject that interests you, take up a new hobby or sport, or spend time with friends of friends who share your interests., If you have lost a friendship that was very dear to you, it can be hard moving on. While you can grieve at first, try not to obsess or worry about the lost friendship. Understand that it is natural for friends to grow apart. You are still worthy of having friends."

Discuss medication options.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
Discuss alternative therapies.",How to Recognize Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Symptoms3," Your doctor will adapt your treatment based upon your symptoms, so treatment can vary from patient to patient. You may be prescribed an antidepressant, such as Elavil or Wellbutrin, or sleeping pill, like Ambien, to help alleviate your symptoms. These can help you cope with feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression and help you get more restful sleep., Cognitive behavior therapy and self-management methods have been shown to help patients with CFS. Cognitive behavior therapy is a common type of psychotherapy that is used to treat a wide variety of issues. Your doctor may recommend these options for you to cope with your symptoms.Over several, structured sessions, a therapist can help you cope with your symptoms and help you learn how to properly respond to the emotions and stress CFS can cause.Self-management programs are typically run by healthcare professionals. These programs highlight the importance of patient education and understanding to treat an illness. These tools can be useful when dealing with a chronic illness like CFS., Your doctor may recommend physical therapy as a treatment option for you. A physical therapist may have you do graded aerobic exercise, such as walking, stair-climbing, and cycling, which may help alleviate CFS symptoms. Daily, incremental activity under the supervision of a physical therapist may help improve your endurance and strength over time., Although alternative therapies have not been verified by medical professionals, it has been noted that yoga, tai chi, or acupuncture can help reduce CFS symptoms. Always talk to your doctor about these alternate methods."

Keep it short and sweet.,
Watch your tone.,
Don't wait too long.,
Don't send too many.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Try not to read into everything.,
Look over your texts before sending.",How to Flirt with a Guy over Text3," While you don't have the texting limitations of the days of old, you do still want to keep your interactions short. Long texts can be a turn off, as your guy has to wade through all that text just to figure out what you're saying.In other words, don't write him a novel.
Shortcuts are fine, as long as the person you're texting is a fan of them, such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud) or BRB (Be Right Back).
However, you don't want to overuse shortcuts, especially ones that are more obscure.These shortcuts, along with a emojis, can be a turn off for some people., Sarcasm is hard to portray over a text message, especially if you don't know the other person that well. Try to skip the sarcasm when flirting with a guy, at least until you both get to know each other better and are better at interpreting each other's tone., Sometimes, you may feel like you need to play games with the person that you like by waiting to respond. It's a type of power struggle. However, in the world of texting, not texting him back in at least a day says you don't like him much.So if you do like him, make sure to text him back fairly quickly.
Really, in the texting world, an hour can seem like a long time.

, If you're sending twenty messages a day, that may be too many, especially if he's not responding to every single one. Keep your count lower, in the 3 to 5 range per day. That way, he has a chance to miss you between the times you're texting.Also, skip the ""Did you get my text?"" messages, as they can come off as being too desperate. If he's not responding, he's likely just busy.

, Texting while drunk means you may text something you regret later. You may flirt a little more than you mean to, or you may turn the guy off because you're saying crazy things. While it may not be easy to stop yourself when you're in the situation, try to avoid it if possible., If you're an overanalyzer, text messages can be your worst nightmare. It gives you just enough text to analyze but not enough so that you can really glean more information from it. If you have this tendency, try not to read too much into what each text is saying. Sometimes, a ""Hi."" is just a hello, not him saying he's not into you because he didn't use an exclamation point., You know autocorrect is sometimes not your friend. Read your text to make sure it makes sense before you send it. That way, you won't get a ""huh?"" back from him.Also, while you don't need perfect grammar to send a text, watching your grammar doesn't hurt. Not everyone is offended by imperfect grammar, but few people while hate on you for having good grammar.

Make business cards.,
Do informational interviews.,
Reach out to contacts.,
Have your contacts to put you in touch with others.,
Go to networking events.,
Go to industry events.",How to Land Your Dream Job3," Business cards are a great thing to have when you are meeting people on the go. They can act as a stand-in for your resume when you meet people in the industry and have all of your vital contact information so that they can contact you if need be.Make sure that your business card has your name, phone number, email address, and a brief statement or title, such as “Software Engineer” or “Copywriter.”

, Informational interviews are meetings where you talk to someone in a company or position that interests you, and ask them questions. Instead of interviewing for a specific position, you hold a conversation in a more casual environment and can ask whatever questions you may have.


Not only are informational interviews great for learning about a field or position, they are also great networking opportunities.
Make sure to tell the person you meet to let you know if they hear of any new positions opening up.
Always write a follow up note. Make sure that after your informational interview, you write a thank you note that thanks them for taking the time to meet with you.

, If you know of anyone in the field or industry, call or email them. Set up a time to have a chat, either on the phone or in person. Just as with an informational interview, ask them any questions you may have. Even if your contacts do not live in the same city as you, it can still be useful to get their advice and knowledge.Ask your contact about their career path, particularly about how they ended up in the position that they’re in now.You could say something like, ""I'd love to hear how you got to be working at this company.""
Ask them if there is any advice they have for you in your search.
You also could ask, ""I was wondering if there are any positions that you know of that you feel I would be qualified for and interested in.""

, Ask your contacts if they know of anyone who would be helpful to you, either because they have specialized knowledge of a field that would interest you, or because they may know of a job opportunity.You can ask them something like, ""Do you happen to know anyone who works in web design? It would be great to learn more about that area specifically.""
The more people you know, the more useful your network will be.

, Find networking events in your area through the Internet or through your contacts. The more specific the networking event is to your area of interest, the better. However, there is still value in going to more generalized networking events.Bring your business cards, and give them to those you talk to.

, Go to any events in your area that have to do with your field of interest. For instance, if you are interested in the hospitality industry, go to any trade shows, opening events or conferences in your area. These are great ways to meet people in the industry and expand your network. They also are opportunities to learn more about the field."

Make the most of your trial period.,
If necessary, return the mattress.",How to Choose a Mattress3," It takes a little while for the body to get accustomed to a new mattress, so start really paying attention to the way it makes you feel after about three days. Think about these questions:


How many hours of sleep do you get on the new mattress?
Do you toss and turn or sleep soundly?
Do you feel achy or sore during the day?
Does your back feel supported, or do you sink into the mattress uncomfortably?
Do you feel well rested, regardless of how much sleep you get?

, If you aren't sleeping well on your new bed, it's best to return it. Start the process of choosing and buying a mattress again, taking into account the factors that made the old one inappropriate for your needs.

Use a tinted moisturizer or a mineral face powder.,
Wear bronzer and blush.,
Try a bold lip color.",How to Accept Your Freckles3," Applying foundation to your face if you have freckles can be tricky, as it can turn your beautiful freckles a gray, blotchy color. You can avoid this by skipping the foundation and using a product with lighter coverage, such as a tinted moisturizer or a mineral face powder. This way, your skin tone still looks even but the color of your freckles are still intact.

You may look for a BB cream or a tinted moisturizer at your local beauty store or online. You can apply these products with your fingers or with a makeup brush.
You can also try a mineral powder in your skin tone. Apply it with a brush for lighter coverage.
If you need to cover up a blemish on your face, make sure you apply concealer in small amounts right on the blemish. Avoid putting concealer on large areas of your face, as it can make your freckles look patchy or only partly covered.

, You can give your face a more sunkissed glow by applying bronzer and blush over your tinted moisturizer or mineral powder. This can enhance your freckles and even out your skin tone. Use a large makeup brush to apply the bronzer and blush on your freckled face.To apply the bronzer, put a small amount of the bronzer on the make up brush. Then, gently make a number “3” on the side of your face, starting from the top of your forehead to around your eye, and then down your jawline. Repeat these steps on the other side of your face.
To apply the blush, put a small amount on the makeup brush. Then, apply one to two swipes of blush on the apples of your cheeks, right above your cheekbones.

, Because you will be wearing fairly neutral makeup, with only tinted moisturizer, bronzer, and blush, you can go bold with your lip color. Try a bold red lip color or a bright pink lip color. Have fun with different colors so your makeup still stands out on your freckled face.You can also play up your eyes by applying colored eye shadow. You may try to play off your eyeshadow color with your lip color. You can also select eye shadow based on your skin tone and your eye color. Read more about choosing makeup colors so your look appears polished and put together, freckles and all.

Keep your cat indoors.,
Purchase protective bandage-covering clothing.,
Avoid intense play.,
Ensure that your cat doesn't chew on its wound dressing.",How to Care for a Bandage or Splint on a Cat2," While your cat is recovering from an injury and wearing a splint or bandage, it should be kept indoors at all times. The odds of your cat's wound wrapping getting wet or loosening are greater outdoors, which could lead to infection or further injury. If you do choose to let your cat outdoors, be sure that its bandage or splint is protected with a waterproof covering (available in many pet stores, or online.), To prevent your cat's bandage from getting loosened, ripped, or chewed, purchase protective bandage-covering clothing for them to wear. Veterinary jackets or boots can keep your cat's bandage or splint dry and clean while they heal. Check with your veterinarian to make sure that such a product would be appropriate for your cat's specific wound, and look online for models that are waterproof, well-made, and properly sized for your pet., While your cat is healing, avoid playing games that involve too much excitement or heavy exercise (e.g. chasing or hunting games). Activity restriction is important, and will help to keep you pet's bandage or splint intact. Increase petting or grooming to keep your cat occupied and content during this time., Monitor your cat to make sure it doesn't chew on its wound dressing. If it does, your cat may need to wear an Elizabethan collar to cut off its access to the wound site. Contact your vet if your cat suddenly begins chewing its bandage or splint after previously leaving it alone, as this may indicate an infection or irritation."

Leave them out for a minute to let the top cloudy later melt off.",How to Make Clear Ice2," Just a regular cooler is fine, like the one you use to keep food and drinks cool for a picnic, but it must be small enough to fit in your freezer. The cooler will insulate your ice cubes, forcing them to freeze slowly from the top down.

, Do not close the cooler. If you can, use trays that make larger ice cubes, or get a series of small, rectangular plastic or silicone containers.

, Proponents of this method claim tap water works as well as distilled and boiled water.

, This water will seal off your ice cubes, keeping cold air from freezing the sides or bottom.

, Make sure your freezer is not set too cold—17-25°F (-3 -8°C) should do it. Leave the cooler for 24 hours.

, The ice should have a thin cloudy layer at the top but be clear the rest of the way through.

,, You now have large, solidly crystal ice cubes."

Don't give up.,
Read!",How to Write a Short Story," Inspiration can strike at any time, so carry a notepad with you wherever you go so that you can write down story ideas as they come to you.


Most of the time, you’ll just think of small snippets of information (a catastrophic event around which you can build a plot, a character’s name or appearance, etc.), but you will sometimes get lucky and a whole story will reveal itself to you in a couple of minutes.
If you have trouble finding inspiration or if you need to write a story in a hurry (for, as an example, a class), learn how to brainstorm. If you can't come up with any ideas, you might have to look to family and friends for inspiration.
Experience usually helps to build good plots. Many of Isaac Asimov's mysteries came from experience of certain incidents.

If you can't think of any ideas, mix different plots from different stories. Make up something - the events of the story doesn't always have to be true.
If you get a topic to write on, don't take the title literally. for example : If the topic is ""Open door"" think of it metaphorically, you can talk about a door to your mind or how a book can open a door to another world. A portal to take you to the future, an opportunity. Try to reach the topic in a different approach; it makes the story more creative.

, After you've chosen an idea, you need to remember the basics of a short story before writing one. The steps to a good short story are:


Flash back : start from an incident that happened before your story started.
Dialogue : a conversation between the characters or a monologue.
Action : Start with something happening or your character doing something.
Introduction: introduce characters, setting, time, weather, etc.
Initiating action: the point of a story that starts the rising action.
Rising action: events leading up to the climax or turning point.
Climax: the most intense point or turning point of the story.
Falling action: your story begins to conclude.
Cliffhanger : don't complete your story and don't tell the audience what happens in the end and leave them to imagine the end. This is useful if you run out of time and don't have time to finish the story.
Resolution: a satisfying ending to the story in which the central conflict is resolved—or not! You don't have to write your short story in order. If you have an idea for a great conclusion, write it down. Move backward or forward from your starting idea (it may or may not be the beginning of the story) and ask yourself questions. “What happened before this?” “What happens next?”

, If you have trouble understanding or finding attributes of a character, turn to your life. You can easily borrow attributes of people you know or even strangers you notice.


For example, you might notice that someone is always drinking a cup of coffee, talks in a loud, booming voice, is always typing away at the computer, etc. All of these observations would together make a very interesting character. Your character can even blend attributes of a number of people.


, For a story to be believable, the characters have to feel genuine and realistic. It can be a difficult task to create interesting and realistic characters. But here are a few strategies to create ""real people"" to populate your story:


Write a list, titled with the character's name, and write all the attributes you can think of, from their position in the orchestra to their favorite color, from their central motivations to their favorite foods. Do they talk with an accent? Do they have any quirky mannerisms? You won’t include all this information in your story, but the more you know, the more your characters will come to life, both for you and for the reader.
Make sure your characters' personalities are not perfect. Every character needs to have some flaws, some problems, some imperfections and some insecurities. You might assume that people wouldn't like to read about a character with a lot of flaws, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Batman wouldn't be The Dark Knight if he weren't a borderline sociopath!
People can relate to characters with problems, as that's realistic. When trying to come up with flaws, you don't need to give your character some huge, bizarre issue (although you definitely can). For most characters, try to stick with things you know about. For example, the character could have anger issues, be afraid of water, be lonely, dislike being around other people, smoke too much, etc. Any or all of these could be developed further.

, A novel can occur over millions of years and include a multitude of subplots, a variety of locations, and an army of supporting characters. The main events of a short story should occur in a relatively short period of time (days or even minutes), and you typically won’t be able to develop effectively more than one plot, two or three main characters, and one setting. If your story has much more breadth, it probably needs to be a novella or novel.

, There are three main points of view from which to tell a story: first-person (“I”), second-person (“you”), and third-person (“he” or “she”). In a first-person story, a character in the story tells the story; in the second-person the reader is made a character in the story; and in the third-person, an outside narrator tells the story. (Second-person narration is rarely used.)


Keep in mind that first-person narrators can only tell what they know (which will be limited to what they see firsthand or are told by others), while third-person narrators can either know everything and explore every character’s thoughts (third-person omniscient) or be limited to only that which can be observed by one character (third-person limited).
You can also mix and match. For example, you could switch between a first-person narrative in one chapter, and third-person in another, or even have more than one first-person point of view. An excellent example of this is the short story ""Rashōmon"", by Akutagawa Ryūnosuke. This was later turned into a movie of the same name by Akira Kurosawa.

, After you've prepared the basic elements of your story, it can be helpful to make some sort of time-line to help you decide what should happen when.


Your story should consist at least of an introduction, initiating incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. You can draw or write a visual with very simple descriptions of what should happen in each of these stages. Having this done will help you keep focused when writing the story, and you can easily make changes to it, so that you are able to keep a steady flow as you write the full story.

, Depending on how thoroughly you've sketched out your plot and characters, the actual writing process may simply be one of choosing the right words.


Generally, however, writing is arduous. You probably won’t know your characters and plot as well as you thought, but it doesn't matter—in a sense, they will tell you what they need, even if you paint them into a corner. Plus, there's always the second draft!


, The first page—some would say the first sentence—of any writing should grab the reader’s attention and leave him/her wanting more.


A quick start is especially important in short stories because you don’t have much room to tell your story. Don’t dillydally with long introductions of the characters or uninteresting descriptions of the setting: get right into the plot, and reveal details about the characters and setting piece-by-piece as you go along.


, You’re almost certain to hit some bumps in the road to finishing your story. You've got to work through them, though. Set aside a time to write each and every day, and make it a goal to finish, say, a page each day. Even if you end up throwing away what you wrote on that day, you've been writing and thinking about the story, and that will keep you going in the long run.


Consider participating in writing groups or activities. One very good activity for writers of all kinds is ""National Novel Writing Month,"" or NaNoWriMo.Every year, from November 1 through November 30th, you are tasked with writing a novel of at least 50,000 words. Brilliance and quality are off the table—the goal is the act of writing. Check out the reference link for more information.

, As you develop your story, you may want to turn your plot in a different direction than you had planned, or you may want to substantially change or remove a character. Listen to your characters if they tell you to do something different, and don’t worry about scrapping your plans altogether if you can make a better story as you go.

, When you've finished the story, go back through it and correct any mechanical mistakes, as well as logical and semantic errors. In general, make sure the story flows and the characters and their problems are introduced and resolved appropriately.


If you have time, put the completed story down for a few days or weeks before editing. Distancing yourself from the story in this way will help you see it more clearly when you pick it back up.

, Send your revised and edited story off to a trusted friend or relative for revisions, edits, and suggestions. Let your reviewers know that you want to hear their real opinions of the story. Give them time to read it and think about it, and give them a copy that they can write on.


Make sure you consider everything that your reviewers tell you—not just the parts you would like to hear. Thank your reviewers for reading your story, and don’t argue with them.
Incorporate whatever edits, revisions, and suggestions you feel are valid. Your writing will be better if you carefully consider constructive criticism, but you don’t have to follow all the advice you get. Some of the suggestions may not be very good. It’s your story, and you need to make the final call!

, It may be frustrating if you're having trouble writing. You can run out of steam, get angry at characters, and feel sad—or even a little guilty—when a beloved character dies or is killed.


Just know that you will, in all probability, doubt your own writing skills at some point. This is totally normal. You'll feel it's not worth continuing, and that you should give up and become a waiter in a dive cafeteria. When these thoughts arise, they can easily take over and make you quit then and there.
One of the hardest tasks as a writer is to learn to squash those feelings and continue writing. When you begin to have these doubtful feelings, or get tired or bored, stop writing! You can get up, take a walk, get a snack, watch TV, or anything to relax. When you return, do so with a fresh mind. You may still not want to write, but tell yourself a few good things about your story—anything about it, from one good passage you wrote, to a well-thought out dialogue, to an interesting character—and congratulate yourself. You're doing something most people can't do.
If someone else knows about your story and has read it, they can also be a good source of encouragement. Just tell yourself that you will finish this story because you want to. It doesn't matter if the story isn't the best ever written—there will be others. If you have a goal to finish it, that's what you'll do.

, Nothing can help you learn how to write a good short story better than reading good short stories. Note the style and how the author uses brevity to their advantage.


Reading a variety of authors and styles will help you learn how to adopt different ""voices"" for each story you write, and broaden your creative palette. Pay attention to how the authors develop their characters, write dialogue, and structure their plots. Here are some suggestions:
""I, Robot"", by Issac Asimov.
""Steps"", by Jerzy Kosinski.
""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"", by Mark Twain.
""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", by James Thurber.

""Three Questions"", by Leo Tolstoy
""Mr Gum and the Power Crystals"" by Andy Stanton, for a children's one. (This is a basic one)
""Brokeback Mountain"", by Annie Proulx
Note: many of these short stories have been turned into successful films, or have become familiar cultural references. For example, ""A Sound of Thunder"", the most re-published sci-fi short story of all time, introduces us to the ""butterfly effect."" Philip K. Dick's stories have given us Blade Runner (""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep""), Total Recall (""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale""), Minority Report (""Minority Report""), A Scanner Darkly (""A Scanner Darkly""), and many others. It is important to have all these elements in order so you can have a head start of ideas to work with.

Choose your base.,
Cut apart some rubber bands.,
Plan out your design.,
Glue the rubber band strips onto your base.,
Brush paint onto the block.,
Press the block down onto a sheet of paper, like a stamp.,
Repeat the design as often as you like until the paper is covered.",How to Do Rubber Band Printing3," Wooden blocks, pieces of cardboard, or small, cardboard jewelry boxes work great for this. Whatever you choose needs to be smaller than your cut rubber bands. This is because you will be gluing the rubber bands on top of the base, not stretching them., Think ahead about your design, then cut apart as many rubber bands as you need. You can use all the same width, but your design will look more interesting if you use both thick and thin rubber bands., Arrange the rubber bands on your base. Play around with different widths. Try to use both thick and thin rubber bands. You can do simple stripes or diagonals. You can also create more interesting designs, such as chevron, zigzags, diamonds, or weaves. Try to leave behind some negative space on the block.You may need to cut some rubber bands shorter so that they fit your design.

, You can use tacky glue or white school glue. Super glue may also work, but not hot glue. Let the glue dry before moving on., Acrylic paint will work best here, but you can also use tempera. You can use all one color, or experiment with different ones.

, You can use plain white paper or even colored paper. White paint on brown packaging paper will give you a nice, rustic effect.

, You can repeat the pattern over and over, or you can rotate the stamp for an interesting look. You should be able to stamp a few times before the paint becomes too pale. When that happens, simply apply more paint.

Think: What is the chain mail?,
Usually at the top there is something such as, ""Don't read this"" or ""Stop"".,
Often the email or comment will be some story, commonly about some monster or fictional dead kid attacking people.,
After you read the story, it will say something like, ""If you do not send this to ten more people, you will die in two days."",
Don't send it to anyone else.,
Even if it is absolutely creepy, keep the mail and smash it.,
If you know the person who sent you the email, tell them that it is really bad manners for them to send you nonsensical curse emails and they should stop and think, because they're either panicking over nothing, or else they sent it on as a joke and it just isn't funny, and makes them look like a gullible schmuck for panicking and forwarding something that is 100% rubbish.,
If they send you another email, follow steps 1-7 again.

,
If the person sends you 3 or more emails, tell someone else.,
Also, if an email ever says something like, ""I will break into your house myself and (enter bad event) you!",How to Not Get Creeped out by a Chain Letter," Is it, ""BBQ at my house! I won't like if you don't come!""? If it is, you're fine (it's not really an alarming thing, just a friend who expects you to show up and might be sore at you if you don't). If not, continue on.

, If there is, you should stop and delete it. Chain letters often tell you to ""read"" or ""don't read"" as a ploy, playing on your initial curiosity so if you read them, they'll eventually hit you with a bunch of baloney designed to push your panic button or use any other emotion you have against you for one purpose only: to get you spreading it further. However, if you are curious, or a rebel or just want to read it, continue. It's just a piece of text with maybe some graphics and animations. It can't actually do anything to you.

, Don't lose your head and get scared. There's no such thing as monsters, you've known that since you were small. No chain letter is going to cause one to blip into existence to kill you or anyone else. You know dead people are dead, and can't go around attacking you, pulling you down some nonexistent well or do any of the things these supposedly creepy chain letters claim. None of these creepy story forwards can actually cause that to happen, either. If you choose to read it, keep in mind the fact that every one of these scary chain email stories are absolutely untrue. Keep thinking this as you read it.

, Think again: Will this really happen to you? Will you actually die because you didn't send an email? How is it even possible that a made up story and text and pixels created by some anonymous hoaxer actually kill you. It can't, any more than your computer monitor and keyboard. There's no more chance of a piece of made-up email tracking you down and killing you than there is of your computer suddenly coming to life and giving you a hug or a slap. Chain letter emails are not living beings and they are not magic. They can't physically do any more harm to anyone than an email you personally write.

, Doing this stops other people getting it and passing it on and it getting worse.

, Write out all of the things wrong with it and make yourself laugh at the utter ridiculousness of the story and the threat attached. Keeping the message is also a good way of stopping a troublesome emailer: you tell someone (teacher, parent, friend, etc.) you have proof of getting this unwanted email. If convenient, ask anyone else who is definitely not creeped out by the chain letter for their ideas. If you get them to dissect and ridicule the story for the fake-creepy, absurd junk it is, you and probably them will end up having a good laugh over it. This completely turns the tables on whoever actually started the chain letter that creeped out the unthinking, easily scared people who got it before you did and passed it on. Being a chain-breaker is good and never killed anyone.

, (Hopefully they'll take the hint and the situation ends here).

,, You can even report them to their internet service provider if they keep sending you unwanted email. The situation is getting out of hand. Tell the person you will block their address if they keep sending you this junk. Chain letters are against the terms of service of many ISPs - they are a type of spam.

,"", you may need to tell an authority (police, principal, etc) but only under dire circumstances such as when it isn't a mere hoax chain letter, but a real threat from an actual person who you know is capable of real violence. (see Warnings).

Make or buy a Cross Academy day class or night class uniform (in the latest chapters, she finally got a night class uniform).,
Get the jewelry.,
Attain Yuuki's hair.,
Yuuki has an average-sized chest.,
Wear burgundy hued contact lenses if you don't have brown eyes.,
Have somebody cosplay as Zero or Kaname and hang around them.,
Be cheerful, kind, and act slightly air-headed.,
Smile and be nice to people.,
Be a little indecisive.,
Have a strong attachment with your close friends.

,
Yuuki is super protective over Zero, so if you have someone you're extremely close to, exhibit protectiveness over this person.

",How to Cosplay As Yuuki Cross from Vampire Knight," You can do so by looking at some pictures of Yuuki and sewing it yourself. If you aren't keen on sewing, ask a friend or family member who is proficient in the skill to make the costume for you. You can also buy it online at a cosplay shop. If you want to cosplay Yuuki in her academy dress, her multiple artwork dresses, or her winter cloak, buy it or sew it after seeing reference pictures. Remember that she likes to dress in soft pastel colors.;
, Yuuki is seen wearing a necklace with the crest of her school. Also, she wears a small metal bracelet that allows her to control Zero. You might also want to get her staff/scythe, Artemis. Otherwise, she is seen with detailed jewelry and clothing in several artworks.

, Have medium-length, brown hair or get a wig. Unless you want to cosplay Yuuki as a vampire, then you need long brown hair down to your lower back. You can also buy a wig for that as well. Remember that she likes to wear cute ""Alice bands"" in her hair, mostly in pastel colors.

, If you have very large breasts, you may want to bind them but it's not really necessary. You could use thin cloth to bind. Don't use bulky cloth because that would make it obvious.

, If you have brown eyes, no need to wear burgundy contacts, but you might like it, though, since her eyes are more reddish brown. To emphasize eyes, wear MAKEUP! Yuuki is a bit of a tomboy, so she's not the type to wear a full face of makeup, but to get those big anime/manga eyes, wear black or brown eyeliner in a anime/manga shape on the upper and lower lash-line, some mascara, and false lashes if you are up to it. Use pictures of Yuuki online for ideas.

, Also, you might like to hang with some Yori or Kaien cosplayers, the people dear to Yuuki. As Yuuki is a very social and talkative person, cos-playing with some others will let you look more like her.

, Yuuki is very naive, comedic, and optimistic, but also very indecisive. Learn about her character and her traits, like being not able to cook something eatable or enjoying parfait.

, Yuuki is known for her kindness and caring nature toward everybody, especially her friends.

, Yuuki's is from time to time fairly insecure due to her missing past so it may help to act this way but don't overdo it. If your going more for vampire Yuuki then don't act indecisive or insecure for that she looses this trait later. Also, be more authoritative.

Feed your dog in the same place each day.,
Set designated feeding times for your dog.,
Limit the duration of their mealtimes.,
Have your dog ""sit"" and wait for their food.,
Make them wait for permission to eat.,
Leave your dog alone while they eat.,
Adjust your dog’s food intake as necessary.,
Phase in any changes gradually.,
Factor treats into your dog’s feedings.,
Feed your pet high-quality “complete and balanced” dog food.,
Limit your dog’s intake to a set amount each day.,
Don’t let your dog beg or feed them scraps.",How to Create a Feeding Routine for Your Dog," This will make your dog feel safe and secure. Pick a spot that's easy to clean, like a kitchen floor or plastic mat in the corner of the room. Make sure that it's away from your dining table.


If your dog is new to you, consider starting by feeding them out of your hand so that they will directly recognize you as the provider of food.;
, It’s best not to let your dog “graze” by leaving food out for them to eat whenever they like. Having a set routine will help their metabolism since it will adjust to their feeding schedule. It will also help to establish your dog's expectations and trust in you if they can count on you providing food at the same time each day.How often you should feed your dog will depend on its age and nutritional requirements along with your schedule. Puppies can feed up to four times a day. Senior dogs who have lower activity levels and smaller portion sizes can be fed once a day.
If possible, most adult dogs should be fed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Spreading out their mealtimes into two equal portions separated by 8-12 hours helps full-grown canines properly digest their food and control their hunger.
To curb separation anxiety, avoid feeding your dog immediately upon your return. When they associate your appearance with the instant gratification of a meal, they will be more likely to be anxious about your return.
To curb the risks of indigestion and the dangerous stomach condition “bloat,” avoid feeding your dog immediately after or before you exercise them., Only give your dog access to their food for a set amount of time, so that they’ll learn to eat it as soon as it’s offered and not be picky about their food. Remove their bowl as soon as 15 or 20 minutes has elapsed, regardless of how much food is left in the dish.Doing so will help establish you as the provider and controller of food, which puts you in charge of your pet instead of vice versa. It will also help streamline other elements of their routine, like going out to do their business since you can let them out about a half hour after each mealtime.

, Domesticated dogs were bred from predators, and they still like to “work” for their meals. You can use mealtimes as an opportunity to bond with your dog and reinforce essential training by making them sit and wait for your command before they eat. Start by asking them to “sit” while you prepare their food and lower their dish.To establish this routine, have your dog sit. Lower their food bowl towards the ground, raising it back up each time they leave the sit position. Each time they allow you to go further towards the ground with the dish before leaving the sit position, reward them with a treat. Work your way gradually towards laying the dish on the ground without them leaving the sit position.Over time, your dog will know to sit and wait for their meal without you commanding them to do so.

, Once your dog is able to sit and wait for their food dish, the next step is getting them to wait to feed until they are released by you (provider of the food) to eat.Once their food dish is on the ground, tell them to “stay” as you stand up. Keep telling them to stay until they have redirected their attention away from the food to you. As soon as they do so, release them to eat with a command phrase such as, “go ahead,” “eat up,” or “chow down.”
When you’re first establishing this routine, take away their food dish if they go for it without asking for permission. After they learn to look at you and wait for your command, you can continue to increase the time they need to focus on you to hone their impulse control.
Teaching dogs to wait for their food shows them that demanding or food-aggressive behavior will not be rewarded. It also provides a general lesson in impulse control that can improve their training and good behavior across the board.

, Now that your dog has earned their meal, let them enjoy it in peace. Trying to touch your pooch or their food dish while they’re eating from it can encourage stress, anxiety, and/or aggressive behavior in your pet., Keep in mind that serving-size recommendations are based on averages. You will need to monitor your dog’s weight and activity level to be sure that the suggested portion and caloric intake is appropriate for their needs.


Make serving-size adjustments as necessary to maintain your dog’s ideal weight. If they’re gaining additional pounds, slowly decrease their daily portion. If they’re losing weight, gradually increase their serving.
Remember that you may also need to alter the quantity that you feed your dog in relation to changes in their environment (such as winter weather), age, health, or activity level.

, If you would like or need to switch any elements of your dog’s feeding routine, such as the amount of food or type of food, do so gradually. This will help their metabolism and digestive track adjust smoothly to the shifts.For instance, if you would like to start your dog on a new food, start by mixing it in with your dog’s old food. Slowly increase the proportion of the new food over the space of a week before serving it on its own.
It’s not necessary to change your dog’s food for the sake of variety. They are well pleased to eat the same food each day, so only make a change if their well-being or phase of life requires it. If your dog is thriving on a particular food (that is, they have good energy and body condition, a shiny coat and healthy digestive track), stick with it.

, It’s wonderful to reward your dog, but it’s best to limit treats to only about 5% of their overall food intake. Dog treats are not required to provide complete and balanced canine nutrition, so it’s best if they only make up a small part of your pet’s diet.Treats and snacks can provide a bit of controlled variation to your dog’s diet. However, feeding your dog many treats will make them more prone to overeating and less likely to eat their regular meals.
When you are doing lots of rewards-based training, you may want to temporarily introduce more treats to your dog’s diet. You can give your dog up to 20% treats in a day, but be sure to adjust their overall food intake accordingly. It’s still best to reserve treats for high-level rewards and use kibble (when they’re hungry) as their normal reward.

, Dry kibble that explicitly says it offers complete and balanced canine nutrition is best. Choose one that aligns with your dog’s age, weight, and activity level. Ask your vet for the ideal food type for your dog.


At least 10% of the diet of the average adult dog should be comprised of protein; at least 5.5% should be fats. Carbohydrates can account for up to half of your dog’s caloric intake.Wet dog food may be advisable for dogs with certain health conditions, such as urinary tract infections. However, most dogs do just as well or better on dry kibble, which is generally cheaper, more nutritionally dense, and better for canine dental health than canned alternatives., At mealtimes, serve your dog a controlled portion of a “complete and balanced” dry dog food that reflects their age, weight, and activity level. Consult with your vet about the suggested daily caloric intake for your dog. You can also use the guidelines printed on the dog food package as a starting point for determining the appropriate serving size.
While it may seem easier as a pet owner, free-choice feeding is not recommended. It can easily lead to weight problems for your pet since it’s harder to keep track of how much your dog is consuming when you let them feed “on demand.”

, Your dog will be far less motivated to eat their own food if you’re treating them to “human food.” Giving them table scraps can lead to nutritional imbalances and obesity while rewarding them for begging behaviors.Human food is often unhealthy and sometimes even poisonous for your dog. Even common, seemingly healthful food like raisins, grapes, onions, or mushrooms can be detrimental to canines; caffeine and chocolate can be lethal.Have your dog stay well away from the table in a designated place during your meal times to prevent begging. Feed them after or at least at a different time from you so that they know they have to wait their turn.

Know your facility.,
Defeat Greta.",How to Conquer the Battle Frontier in Pokémon Emerald Version3," The Battle Arena is located east of the Battle Tower and north of the Battle Palace. Sparring matches between Trainers and Pokémon are often held here. In this facility, you will fight with 3 of your own Pokémon against a series of Trainers. The only limitation: you only have three turns to defeat each of your opponent’s Pokémon. If you fail to defeat a Pokémon in the given turn limit, the match will go to judging. Again, if you win all 7 battles, you clear a round. This facility tests the power and will of you and your Pokémon. At the end of 3 turns in a battle, both combatants are judged on the following traits:

Mind. For every effective attack, a Pokémon is awarded 1 point in this category. However, no points are awarded. move used requires that the user be hit first (such as with Counter or Mirror Coat). A maximum of 2 points can be awarded in this category.
Skill. This category assesses a Pokémon’s accuracy. One point is awarded for every successful move. A maximum of 2 points can be awarded.
Body. This category measures a Pokémon’s vitality. The Pokémon’s HP (hit points) at the end of the 3rd round is compared to its HP at the beginning of the 1st round. The Pokémon with the better ratio wins the 2 points in this category.

, The Frontier Brain of the Battle Arena is known as Greta, the Arena Tycoon. She is encountered after the 28th and 56th battle in a streak. This means that for the Silver challenge, Greta will be the final Trainer of the 4th consecutive round. For the Gold challenge, she will be the final Trainer of the 8th consecutive round. Once defeated, she will award the respective Guts Symbol."

Buy fruit juice or squeeze your own.,
Coat the sliced bananas in the juice.,
Use or store the bananas.,
Revive discolored banana slices with pineapple or grapefruit juice.",How to Keep Sliced Bananas from Discoloring1," There are several fruit juices that can keep banana slices from turning brown. You can use fresh juice or storebought varieties — it doesn't matter. See our juicing guide if you'd like to make your own. Either way, you won't need much — a half cup or so is plenty for one or two bananas.



Lemon juice is the most well-known juice used for keeping fruits from turning brown. It works just as well for bananas as it does for apples.However, there are many other juices that work well, including:
Lime juice
Orange juice
Tinned pineapple juice
Tinned or fresh grapefruit juice
Apple juice;
, To do this, you can sprinkle the juice over the slices or dip the slices into the juice. You can also immerse the slices in the juice and leave them there for a few minutes, allowing them to soak up some of the juice. This can be great for keeping them fresh-looking but may affect their taste a little more than normal.


Another quick way to coat the bananas is to put them in a sealed plastic bag with the juice and gently turn it over a few times.
To minimize any change to the flavor of the bananas, use the juice sparingly or place it in a spray bottle and spritz it over the slices.

, Once they're soaked in fruit juice, the bananas will take much longer to turn brown. Whether you're eating the slices raw or making a pie, fruit kabobs, a parfait, or a fruit salad, you can trust that your bananas will look fresh well through the end of the meal. They should even last without refrigeration in a plastic container for a few hours — perfect for packed lunches.


Even with the fruit juice, banana slices are best consumed the same day. The cold temperatures of refrigerators can turn the peels brown, but if you're OK with this, the fruit itself should remain fresh.If you do refrigerate the slices, be sure to put them in an airtight container with as little air in it as possible.

, If your banana slices are already brown, all is not lost. You can lighten discolored banana slices by immersing them in tinned pineapple juice or grapefruit juice for 10-15 minutes. They won't quite return to their original pale yellow color, but they will look fresher and more delicious.

Keep your upper body relaxed.,
Let your body sway naturally to the music.,
Find a partner to dance with.,
Place your arms around your partner.,
Sway back and forth slowly to the music.",How to Dance at Homecoming," The better you look on the big night, the more confident you'll feel. This confidence will show through and put you in the mood to break it down on the dance floor.


Ladies, wear shoes that you feel comfortable dancing in. It's perfectly fine to wear heels, but try to find a pair that you can move around in. The more comfortable you feel physically, the more natural it will feel to dance.;
, Dancing alone can feel awkward and isn't as much fun. If possible, go to homecoming with a group of friends and their dates so that you can share in the festivities together.

, Before dashing to the dance floor, take a moment to soak up your surroundings and familiarize yourself with the venue. Take a lap around the room, get something to drink, and head to the bathroom if you need to. Getting comfortable with your environment will make you feel less intimidated by the prospect of dancing in front of others.

, Instead of focusing so hard on what to do with your body, listen to the music first and find the beat. Pay attention to how fast or slow the song is, and how it makes you feel.

, Really listen to the song that's playing and bob your head to the beat in a way that feels natural.

, This is a basic move to get you started. Be sure to stay on the balls of your feet when dancing to avoid feeling planted onto the ground.

, People who are nervous have a tendency to tense up in the shoulder and neck area. Be conscious of this, and let your shoulders fall and sway back and forth as you dance.

, Remember to keep listening to the music as you dance. Try not to focus so hard on whether what you're doing is right, and pay attention instead to whether your body is moving in rhythm with the music.


Don't try to dance faster than you feel comfortable doing. Even during fast songs, you can move at a slow pace, as long as you are streamlined with the beat.

, If you are with a date, then it is expected that the two of you will slow dance together, so grab your partner when the song starts! If you'd like to dance with somebody who isn't your date, then make sure they want to dance by asking them first.

, Typically, boys put their hands around a girls' waist and girls put their hands around the guys' neck.

, You will have to coordinate which way to move with your partner; it may take a couple of seconds for the two of you to get in sync.


If you are dancing with a person with whom you are romantically involved, then pull them close and rest your head on his or her shoulder/neck area.
Don't step on your partner's toes! Be conscious of where you are stepping, especially if you are wearing heels.

Also, bring backup equipment in case your main equipment breaks down while taking the photos. Equipment includes things like spare batteries, cameras, lenses and memory cards. Put everything in photo bags so it's ready to go in the morning.Other accessories include a flash, tripod, diffuser, and lights.;
, Have a conversation with the couple getting married so you can get a better sense of the wedding location and what they are looking for. Talk to them about your thoughts on the best locations at the wedding venue to take photos and come up with backup plans.For instance, if the bride and groom want family photos taken outdoors but the weather turns out to be bad, plan a backup location indoors that the bride and groom would be happy with.

, Going to the site of the wedding beforehand will give you insight into the best places to take photos. You can also test different camera angles and take note of how the light looks during different times of the day. Look for spaces that enhance the beauty of winter and make use of interesting architecture or beautiful, natural landscapes., The winter can be cold, and you'll need steady hands to take good photos. Make sure that you dress appropriately for the weather. It's always good to overdress rather than underdress because you can remove garments of clothing if you get too hot. Remember to wear a hat, gloves, a scarf, and heavy winter jacket if it's going to be cold outside.


Choose your outfit the night before to save time on the day of the wedding.

, Sunlight is limited during the winter, so if you want to get group or portrait photos outside, it's important that you show up early. This will also allow you the additional time to unpack your gear and get prepared and set up for the day. Do one last survey of the wedding location so you can nail down any final details of the photo shoot.

Your doctor might prescribe additional medication, including steroids and muscle relaxers like Robaxin and Soma.Prescribe a neck brace if there is severe pain and muscle weakness. This can be provided by a medical supply company in the area.Prescribe an imaging study after a few weeks or months, or if you show signs of neurologic compromise (numbness, tingling, weakness, clumsiness), to verify and better understand the injury. Possible imagining techniques include MRI, Myelogram, CT, or EMG., Physical therapy includes stretches and straightening exercises, which strengthen the muscles that support the neck. It also is likely to include traction, which gently relieves the stress on the neck for short periods of time.Building strong abdominal muscles and lean body mass will also be important for preventing future re-injury., Occupational therapy may be necessary if the way you work or your daily routine has caused or aggravated the disc herniation. These therapists may be able to improve the way you walk, sit or stand to help reduce pain. Special care should be exercised when performing heavy lifting., Chiropractic care may also be necessary in order to restore mobility in the neck and to open up the joint in order for the disc to return to its normal position. You do not need a doctor's referral in order to go to a chiropractor., Consider surgery only if conservative treatments were attempted and failed to produce results after a period of at least six weeks or if you have a large herniation with neurologic compromise.

Purchase tracking if it is not already in your ceiling. You can buy ripplefold tracking, which brings a curve to your partitions at upholstery or furniture stores. You can find less expensive tracking options, such as canvas stretchers at art supply or hardware stores.
Set up the partitions so they are functional and attractive. You may need to experiment with spacing to get the look and feel you want in your loft.;
, For example, create a living room area by placing two sofas or loveseats in an ""L"" shape.


Use large furniture pieces, such as armoires and sectionals to separate living space from sleeping space.
Float your furniture instead of backing it up against walls. This will allow all sides of the furniture to be seen, and it makes a loft space seem less wide open and more organized and contained.

, Pay attention to what belongs. In order to break off a kitchen space, for example, do not keep the dishes near the bed.

Try sashimi or ceviche.,
Try carpaccio.,
Consider raw dairy products.",How to Get Enough Protein on a Raw Food Diet2," Although many people who follow a raw diet are vegans, both vegetarians and omnivores also follow the raw food diet. If you are an omnivore, you can enjoy raw fish dishes such as sashimi and ceviche. Both of these are high in protein and can provide a much needed boost to your plant-based protein sources.Choose sashimi, which is usually thinly sliced fish. In most cases, salmon and tuna are the types of fish used.Salmon sashimi has 5.6 g per ounce and white tuna has 7.2 g per ounce. You can also try sashimi made from eel at 6.7 g per ounce or sardine, which has 7 g per ounce.Make ceviche, which is a Latin American dish of raw fish or seafood marinated in citrus juice.A ¼ cup of ceviche has 13 g of protein., Carpaccio is an Italian delicacy that is made of thin slices of raw meat such as beef.A 3 ounce serving of beef carpaccio has 25 g of protein.Keep in mind that eating raw or undercooked meat can cause serious illness or even death., Milk, cheese, and other dairy products such as yogurt are all very high in protein, but for many raw dieters, they’re off limits because the process of pasteurization heats dairy to remove pathogenic bacteria.If you would like to boost your protein, consider trying raw dairy products.Animal milks have 8 g of protein per 8 ounces.Locate local farms and stores that sell raw milk and milk products by using an online sites such as Agrilicious at http://www.agrilicious.org/local/raw-milk. A Campaign for Real Milk can also help you find local farms that sell unpasteurized dairy products at http://www.realmilk.com/real-milk-finder/.
Raw, unpasteurized milk is illegal in some states.Vary your dairy options by choosing different milks and milk products such as cow, goat, and sheep.
Keep in mind that consuming unpasteurized dairy products can expose you to dangerous bacteria including Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. All of these can cause serious illness.Pregnant women are strongly discouraged from consuming raw dairy.

Head back to Whiterun.,
Follow Irileth.,
Climb the tower.,
Use range attacks on Mirmulnir.,
Use melee attacks on Mirmulnir.,
Avoid its fire breath.,
Repeat steps 4 to 6 if necessary.",How to Kill the Dragon in Dragon Rising in Skyrim," After completing the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest, quickly go back to Whiterun—the first city in the game—and talk to Irileth, the Housecarl of the city. You’ll find her inside Dragonsreach, the main and largest building in the northern part of the city.;
, Irileth will tell you that a dragon has been spotted in the western area of Whiterun. Follow her, along with other guards, as they head out of the city towards the Western Tower, a broken down watchtower a few miles southwest of Whiterun.

, Once you get to the area, Mirmulnir will start attacking you and the other guards. Enter the tower through the open door at the bottom and make your way to the top using the staircase inside.

, Use bow and arrows or range spell attacks like Firebolt, Lightning Bolt, or Ice Spikes to damage the dragon. He will be flying around out of your reach at first. Damaging him is the key to bringing him down. Keep firing range attacks at Mirmulnir until his health nears half.

, Once he takes sufficient damage from your range attacks, Mirmulnir will land and attack you or the guards (whoever is closest). Once he’s on ground, you’ll now be able to reach him. Use whatever melee weapon your Dragonborn has to attack and damage the dragon.

, Mirmulnir will also be randomly blowing fire breaths at you or the guards while its on land. This attack is pretty hard to dodge at close range since dragons are quick at breathing flames. Once you notice that Mirmulnir is about to open his mouth, quickly jump out of his way to avoid the breath of fire.

, Depending on the strength of your main character, you can kill Mirmulnir in one landing. On the other hand, if you fail to finish him off, he’ll take to the skies again. Simply repeat steps 4 to 6 until you kill the dragon.

Align the seams.,
Spray the starch on the sleeve.,
Iron the sleeve.,
Iron the cuff.,
Flip it over and iron the other side.",How to Iron a Dress Shirt2," It is important to open the shirt in order to iron it. For some shirts, you will find that they iron much easier when they are inside out. Experiment with flipping the shirt inside out to see if it improves the final look.








, Read the fabric content label and set the iron to match, err on the cool side. For cotton/poly blend use a polyester setting.


If your garment label does not forbid steam, use steam. It will make ironing much easier.

, With the rest of the shirt off to the side, lay out the sleeve on the ironing board. The cuff should be at the narrow end of the board. Lay it as flat as possible, button-side of the cuff down, and smooth it out by hand.

, Starting with the seam on the underside of the sleeve (the one that leads into the armpit), flatten the sleeve from the point until another ""seam"" is created on the other side.








, Get some spray starch or sizing and spray it onto the whole sleeve, following the directions on the can.








, Iron the sleeve, starting from the shoulder and working down until about 3"" from the beginning of the cuff. Be careful to avoid ironing over the buttons underneath.









If you want to avoid the seamed look, stop just short of the edges. Do a quarter turn on the sleeve before doing the other side and iron the new center to avoid wrinkles that you would have missed at the edge.

, There are a number of different ways to do this. Because off the little gathers and pleats at the cuff of dress shirts, this can be a very difficult area to iron. How you do it will depend on how much effort you want to put in and how dramatic the gathers and pleats on the cuff are.









You can simply iron the bottom of the sleeve and the cuff in small sections, if you want to save time and don't care too much about how it looks. Spread the pleats and gathers by hand and iron
You can roll up the hand towel into a tight roll (toughly the same size as your wrist) and place it in the cuff. Iron with this in place to avoid much of the difficulty of ironing this area.
If the pleats and gathers are very badly wrinkled, ball up the hand towel and stuff in down the sleeve so that it fills out the area as much as possible. Use the steam function to ease most of the wrinkles and then iron it as much as you can.

, This should be done in the exact same way as the first side, but should require less effort.

Drink enough water.",How to Look Refreshed when You Wake Up4," Everyone knows exercise is good for your body, but it’s also good for your skin. Working out tones and firms your muscles, which helps the skin look better. On top of that, exercise aids in circulation which feeds skin cells with oxygen and nutrients, it dilates the skin, and reduces inflammation.There are multiple ways exercise makes you look refreshed.


Clean your skin before you work out to help keep your pores unclogged.
Keep your skin cooler and cleaner by wearing moisture-wicking clothing to get the perspiration away from your skin. This also helps prevent acne.Exercise in a cool environment that helps keep your body temperature down. This can help prevent flare-ups of some skin conditions.Apply a skin moisturizer. Using skin moisturizer before exercise helps repel sweat, and applying afterwards – especially after swimming – helps fight dry, cracked skin and unhealthy appearance.Exercise reduces stress and anxiety. Feel happy about your condition, your confidence, and your fitness. Even just 15 minutes of exercise can reduce anxiety levels., Studies have shown that alternating hot and cold treatment, even including a sauna, has great benefits. Blood flow is increased, the metabolism speeds up, depression is minimized, and the body is stimulated. After you're cleaned up, alternate between the coldest temperature you can tolerate, then the hottest, and finish with the coldest again., Smoking has been related through studies to a variety of skin aging issues as well as skin conditions like psoriasis. The heat from the cigarette directly affects the skin, and the elasticity is worsened because the blood vessels are constricted. On top of that, levels of vitamin A are reduced., Eat meals healthy for your body, those high in fiber with minimal fats, especially saturated fat. These diets boost energy and mood, while poorer diets make you drowsy and miserable.Choose foods with folic acid and Vitamin B12, like leafy green vegetables and beans, to reduce symptoms of depression. Eat plenty of fruits. Some studies have linked eating fruit to better physical health, and better feelings about personal health.Eat fish often. Multiple studies have linked eating plenty of seafood to lower levels of depression. Try to fit fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids into your daily diet., Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water per day. Drinking plenty of water has been shown to increase blood flow and elasticity of the skin, making it appear thicker, moister, and healthier."

Give your horse proton-pump inhibitors.,
Give your horse histamine Type 2 (H2) receptor Blockers.,
Try giving your horse protective coatings.,
Try other substances that promote protective lining growth.,
Give your horse antacids.,
Give your horse probiotics.",How to Treat Stomach Ulcers in Horses3," These drugs cause complete blocking of acid production, which in turn lets the stomach heal itself. These drugs are more potent than others and are generally given to the horse once a day.


Omeprazole and pantoprazole are both proton-pump inhibitors. Omeprazole (dose at 0.7mg to 1.4mg/kg daily), is the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. Commercially available paste of omeprazole can be given once a day, and during transport.

, These drugs cause partial blockage of acid production in the stomach, hence it is given more frequently. In general, you should give your horse this medication three or four times a day.


Cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are variations of this medication. Dose of cimetidine (300 to 600mg 3 to 4 times a day). Ranitidine is effective in foals and is given once a day.

, These drugs provide a protective lining in the stomach mucosa and aid in its healing process. There are two main kinds of prescribed protective lining, sucralfate and lecithin.


Sucralfate: this drug binds to the stomach mucosa and may promote healing. Dose for foals (1 to 2 grams in foals 4x a day), in horses (2mg/kg 2x a day).
Lecithin: contains phospholipids and essential fatty acids like linolenic acid (omega 6), and linoleic acid (omega 3). Lecithin binds to the lipid layer of the stomach, providing an additional layer of protections against acids, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids strengthens the cell membranes of the stomach lining.

, Other substances that give a protective layer in the stomach include slippery elm powder, low protein whey powder, and psyllium husk. These substances can be given as slurry before feeding, or as top dressing in dry feed.

, Sodium bicarbonate can be used up to 200grams per dosing to provide short term relief, and neutralize gastric acid, it is usually given after feeding whole grain rations.

, Probiotics include yoghurt products containing Lactobacilli spp. As a daily, these probiotic supplements can help as the beneficial bacteria competes with ulcer forming bacteria.


Prostaglandins can also combat bad bacteria. These are recommended in horses that have developed ulcers because they have high doses of NSAIDs.

NotePad can be accessed on any version of windows using ⊞ Win + R > Notepad.
TextEdit can be accessed on Mac by going to Applications > TextEdit.;
, A section of PHP code begins and ends with bracketed PHP tags (“<?php” “?>”). “Echo” is a very basic statement (an instruction to the computer) in the PHP language that will output text to the screen. The text you want to echo must be enclosed in quotation marks and end in a semi-colon.


The code should look something like <?php echo “Hello World!”; ?>.

, This is done by navigating to File > Save As...


In Notepad, add .php to the end of the filename and enclose in double quotations. This ensures the file will not be converted into a basic text file by Notepad. Without the quotation marks, the file will become hello world.php.txt. Alternatively, you can select the drop down menu under Save as type and change it to ""All Files (*.*)"" which will leave the name exactly how you type it and the quotes will not be needed.
In TextEdit, no quotations marks are necessary, but a popup will appear asking you to verify that you want the file saved as .php.
Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on Mac, but can be set by the user manually.

, Open your preferred web browser and type this address in the address bar using the name of your php file: http://localhost/hello world.php. Your browser window should display the echo statement.


If you receive an error message, make sure you typed the code correctly as shown above, including the colon.
Also make sure that your file is saved into the correct directory.

, The “<?php” and “?>” tags tell the PHP engine that everything between them is PHP code. Everything outside the two tags is treated as HTML and ignored by the PHP engine and sent to your browser the same as any other HTML. The important thing to recognize here is that PHP scripts are embedded inside regular HTML pages.

, Statements are used to tell the PHP engine to do something. In the case of an echo statement, you are telling the engine to print what is inside the quotes.


The PHP engine itself never actually prints anything to your screen. Any output generated by the engine is sent to your browser as HTML. Your browser does not know that it's getting PHP output. As far as the browser is concerned, it's getting plain HTML.

, Adding HTML tags can alter the output of the php statement. The “<strong>” “</strong>” tags will add bold formatting to any text placed inside of them. Note that these tags appear on the outside of the text, but inside of the quotations marks of the echo statement.


You want your code to look something like:
<?php?
echo ""<strong>Hello World!</strong>"";
?>

, Go to File > Save As… and save the file as ""helloworld2.php”, and open it in your browser by using the address: http://localhost/helloworld2.php. The output is the same as before, but this time the text is in bold.


Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.

, Remember, statements need to be separated by a semicolon.


Your code should look something like:
<?php
echo “Hello World!”<br>;
echo “How are you doing?”;
?>

, The page will display two echo statements, listed in order, on two lines. Notice the “<br>” on the first line. This is HTML markup to insert a line break.


If you didn't add this, your output would look like this:
Hello World!How are you doing?

, To manipulate data, be it numbers or names, you need to store the data in a container. This process is called declaring the variable. The syntax for declaring a variable is “$myVariable = “Hello World!”;”


The dollar sign ($) at the beginning tells PHP that $myVariable is a variable. All variables must start with the dollar sign, but the name of the variable can be anything.
In the above example, the value is ""Hello World!"", and the variable is $myVariable. You're telling PHP to store the value at the right of the equal sign, into the variable at the left of the equal sign.
A variable containing a text value is known as a string.

, Referring to a variable in the code is known as a call. Declare your variable, then echo the variable instead of typing out the text.


Your code might look something like:
<?php>
$myVariable = “Hello World!”;
echo $myVariable;
?>

, Go to File > Save As… and save the file as “myfirstvariable.php”. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/myfirstvariable.php and the script will print the variable. The output looks the same as printing plain text, but how it was achieved is different.


Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.

, Variables can also contain numbers (known as integers), and then those numbers can be manipulated using simple mathematical functions. Start by declaring three variables called “$mySmallNumber”, “$myLargeNumber”, and “$myTotal”.


Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber;
$myLargeNumber;
$myTotal;
?>

, Give an integer value to “$mySmallNumber” and “myLargeNumber”.


Note that integer values do not need to be contained in quotation marks. That will cause numbers to be treated as a text value like the “Hello World!” variable.
Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber = 12;
$myLargeNumber = 356;
$myTotal;
?>

, Rather than doing the math yourself, you can call the two variables in the “$myTotal” variable. Using a mathematical function, the machine will calculate the sum for you. To print the variable, you need only add an echo statement that calls the variable after the declaration.


Any change to either integer variable would be reflected when printing the “$myTotal” variable with echo.
Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber = 12;
$myLargeNumber = 356;
$myTotal = $mySmall Number + $myLargeNumber;
echo $myTotal;
?>

, Your browser window will display a single number. That number is the sum of the two variables called in the “$myTotal” variable.

, Using a variable to store text allows you to call that variable any time you want to use the store value instead of constantly typing out the contained text. It also allows for more complex manipulation of the stored data moving forward.


The first variable, $myVariable, contains a string value; ""Hello World!"". Unless you change the value, $myVariable will always contain the value ""Hello World!"".
The echo statement prints the contained value of $myVariable.

, You have explored basic manipulation of integer variables by using a mathematical function. The resulting data can be stored into another variable. This is only the beginning of what can be accomplished with these variables.


The two variables, $mySmallNumber, and $myLargeNumber are each assigned an integer value.
The third variable, $myTotal, stores the added values of $mySmallNumber and $myLargeNumber. Since $mySmallNumber holds one numeric value, and $myLargeNumber holds a second numeric value, this means $myTotal holds the value of the first number added to the second number. This value can change with alterations to either of the included variables.

If you are using a small spool of thread, place the cap on the pin so that the small side is next to the spool.;
, Feed the thread through the thread guides and around the bobbin winder tension discs.


Snap the thread into the small plastic thread guide lying directly to the left of the spool pin.
With the thread held in place by the thread guide, wind the thread clockwise around the bobbin winder tension discs in front of the guide.

, Insert the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin spool.


Feed the thread through from the inside so that the tail is still on the outside of the bobbin.
If you're using a bobbin with holes on both sides, only slip the thread through one hole.

, Place the bobbin on the bobbin winding spindle, located to the far right of the machine. Lock the spindle in place.


The tail of thread should still stick out through the top of the bobbin.
To lock the spindle in place, push the bobbin as far to the right as it will go. This sets the machine to its ""bobbin winding"" mode.

, Hold the thread tail and gently step on the foot control pedal. The machine should begin to wind the bobbin.


If desired, you can let go of the thread tail after the bobbin has wound a few rotations, but doing so is not necessary.
The machine should automatically stop once the bobbin is full.
Note that the hand wheel should not turn and the machine should not sew while the machine is in its bobbin winding mode.

, Cut the thread to separate the bobbin from the spool. Unlock the bobbin winding spindle and lift the bobbin away to remove it.Unlock the spindle by pushing it back to the left. Note that the machine will not sew until the bobbin winding spindle is back in its left position.
You should also trim the tail of thread sticking out from the top bobbin hole after removing the bobbin.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine until the needle reaches its highest point.


Turn the machine off before threading the needle.
Rotate the hand wheel toward you.
Raise the presser foot to release the tension discs at this time, as well.

, Place the spool of thread on the spool pin at the top of the machine. Fit the spool cap on the pin next to the spool of thread.


You'll need to lift up the spool pin before you can position the spool of thread on it.
For larger spools, the large side of the cap should face the spool. For smaller spools, the small side of the cap should face the spool.

, Draw the thread through the upper thread guide, then guide it around the guide an through the pre-tension spring.The upper thread guide is a latch lying to the left of the spool pin.
The pre-tension spring lies inside of a second latch positioned in front of the upper thread guide.

, Guide the thread down through the right channel at the front of the machine, then back up through the left channel.


You may need to pinch or hold the thread between the spool and the upper thread guide while doing this to maintain an appropriate amount of tension.

, Slide the thread into the slot of the take-up lever at the top of the left channel.


After inserting the thread through the take-up lever, pull it back down through the left channel again.

, Guide the thread through the horizontal lower thread guide and into the thin wire clamp guide.


The horizontal thread guide is a flat clip lying beneath the left channel.
The thin wire needle clamp is positioned directly above the needle.

, Feed the thread through the eye of the needle, inserting it from front to back.


Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through to the back of the needle.

, Press this lever down as far as it will go. The threader should swing into its threading position.This lever should be located to the left of the needle.
Note that these instructions only apply to models of the machine equipped with an automatic needle threader.
Standard needle threading instructions still apply when you use an automatic threader. This feature only assists you with inserting the thread through the eye of the needle; the rest of the process should be treated exactly the same way.
Even if your machine has this feature, you can still thread the needle by inserting it through the eye without assistance. This feature is only optional.

, Swing the thread down and around the thread guide hook to the left of the needle.

, Drag the thread through the hook lying directly to the right of the needle.


After inserting it through the hook, wrap the thread around that hook from bottom to top.

, Push the threading lever back up to release the automatic threading system. In doing so, you should cause a loop of thread to swing into the eye of the needle.


Grab that loop of thread and pull it through to the back of the needle.
Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through the eye.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you until the needle reaches its highest position.


Make sure that the machine is off while you insert the bobbin.

, Open the hinged cover at the front of the machine and pull the bobbin case straight out.


To open the cover, grab it along the side and push it down. The cover will open but will not detach.
To remove the bobbin case, pull on the bobbin case tab and lift the case straight toward you.

, Hold the bobbin case with one hand while slipping the wound bobbin into the case with the other.The thread should run in a clockwise direction around the bobbin as you insert it into the case.
Keep a tail of thread roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long out of the case as you insert the bobbin.

, Grab the remaining tail of thread and pull it through the slit at the top of the bobbin case.


Continue sliding the thread through that slit until it slips under the finger of the case.

, Hold the loaded bobbin case by its hinged latch and slip it back into its place in the machine.


Release the latch. If the case has been positioned correctly, it should be secure inside the machine. You should not be able to remove it unless you lift the hinged latch again.
Close the cover when done by pushing it back up and into place.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you. Continue until the needle goes through a full rotation, lowering into the machine and rising back out to its highest position.For the sake of safety, it is best to do this while the machine is off. The presser foot should also be raised during this procedure.
As you turn the wheel, you should see a loop of thread appear through the needle plate hole beneath the needle. This loop of thread is from the bobbin.

, Gently tug on the upper thread to release the loop and bring the lower bobbin thread completely through the needle plate hole.


Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of bobbin thread out through the plate.

, Position both threads so that they lie toward the back of the machine.


Both threads must pass beneath the pressure foot. The upper thread will need to slide through the ""toes"" of the pressure foot.
The completion of this step marks the completion of the entire threading process.

Find your sound's intensity in watts/square meter.,
Divide by 10-12.,
Take the Log10 of your answer and multiply by 10.,
Understand the logarithmic nature of decibel values.",How to Measure Decibels3," For everyday practical purposes, decibels are usually seen as a simple measure of loudness. However, the truth is a little more complex. In physics, decibels are often thought of as a convenient way of expressing the intensity of a sound wave. The larger the amplitude of a given sound wave, the more energy it transmits, the more it moves the air particles in its path, and the more ""intense"" the sound is.Because of this direct relationship between a sound wave intensity and and its volume in decibels, it's possible to find a decibel value given nothing more than an intensity level for the sound (which is typically measured in watts/square meter)


Note that, for ordinary sounds, the intensity value is usually very small. For instance, a sound with an intensity of 5 ×10-5 (or 0.00005) watts/square meter translates to about 80 decibels — about the volume of a blender or food processor.
To better understand the relationship between intensity measurements and decibels, let's follow along with an example problem. For the purposes of this problem, let's say that we're music producers and we're trying to find the background noise level in our recording studio to improve the sound of our records. After setting up our equipment, we detect a background noise intensity of 1 × 10-11 (0.00000000001) watts/square meter . In the next few steps, we'll use this info to find the decibel level of the background noise in our studio.

, Once you've found the intensity of your sound, you can simply plug it into the formula 10Log10(I/10-12) (where ""I"" is your intensity in watts/square meter) to find its decibel value. To begin, divide by 10-12 (0.000000000001). 10-12 represents the intensity of a 0 decibel sound, so by comparing your intensity value to this, you're essentially finding its relationship to this base value.


In our example, we'd divide our intensity value, 10-11, by 10-12 to get 10-11/10-12 = 10.

, To finish solving, all you need to do is take the base 10 logarithm of your answer, then, finally, multiply by 10. This accounts for the fact that decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10 — in other words, an increase of 10 decibels means that the loudness of the sound has doubled.


Our example is easy to solve. Log10(10) = 1. 1 ×10 = 10. Therefore, the background noise in our studio has a loudness of 10 decibels. This is quite quiet, but still detectable with our high-quality recording equipment, so we'll probably need to eliminate the source of the noise for the best recordings

, As noted above, decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10. For any given decibel value, a noise 10 decibels greater is twice as loud, a noise 20 decibels greater is 4 times as loud, and so on. This makes it easy to describe the huge range of sound intensities that can be picked up by the human ear. The loudest sound the ear can hear without experiencing pain is more than one billion times more intense than the quietest noise it can detect.By using decibels, we avoid having to use huge numbers to describe common sounds — instead, we only need to use three digit numbers at most.


Consider this — which is easier to use: 55 decibels or 3 × 10-7 watts/square meter? The two are equivalent, so rather than having to use scientific notation (or a very small decimal), decibels allow for us to use a sort of simple shorthand for easy everyday use.

In the beginning, you’ll need to start building this bond by spending time with your dog. Pet your pup to make it happy. Show your dog some affection by petting it and spending time with it. Let the dog know it is your companion.Take the dog with you places and put a bed for it in your bedroom to sleep in at night.;
, Establish a regular feeding routine for your dog. If your dog learns to rely on you for its meals, it will trust you in other aspects of its life as well. This means that your dog will listen to you more effectively and follow commands, which is a very important skill for hunting dogs to learn.Feed your dog once in the morning and once in the evening, following the advice of your veterinarian.

, Your dog needs plenty of exercise, especially if you want it to develop into a good hunting dog. Strengthen your bond with your dog by taking it for walks. This will let the two of you spend more time together while also teaching your dog to follow commands – like walking on a leash and following your lead. These skills will be important in the field, so you need to help your hunting dog master them early on.Most hunting dogs need about 30 minutes of exercise every day, depending on the breed.

, Let your dog familiarize itself with the great outdoors by taking it outside on short excursions. Let it smell the foliage and run around off leash (if you can allow your dog to safely run off leash). This will help your dog get used to being outside like it will be when you take it on hunting trips later.Try to take your dog specifically to places you intend to hunt so it can get accustomed to the landscape. This will help your dog be less distracted once you actually take it hunting.

, When you take a dog hunting, your dog may have to run through some creeks, rivers, or streams – or even swim out into a lake. To help your dog feel comfortable with this, you should encourage it to encounter water from an early age. Teach your dog to swim by taking it to places you can help it learn to swim. Try it at a swimming pool.Don’t push your dog too hard at first. You may need to pick it up and carry it across the water the first few times. Let your dog go at the pace it wants.

, Help your dog learn how to go off-leash by training it, teaching it to come, teaching it to stay, and by using positive reinforcement.You’ll need your dog to be trained to go off-leash if you want it to work for you as a hunting dog.

, Gather a really drippy treat, like a small slab of raw meat, lunchmeat, or cheese dipped in water. Do not dip meat in water as this will dilute the smell. Let the dog smell the treat and figure out that it wants to eat it.


Eventually, you’ll be able to transition to using dry treats. But you’ll probably need to start off with wet treats to entice the dog even more., Have someone hold the pup at the far end of your lawn or a large field. Put a long string on the drippy treat. Standing next to the person, let the dog smell the treat. Drag the treat along the ground – around obstacles and under bushes or crops. Make sure the dog can still smell the treat, but have the person holding the leash keeping the dog put.Be careful not to let the dog catch the treat yet; you want to make your dog practice following the scent.

, Leave the treat on the ground at the end of the trail, but make sure you remove the string. Come back to the dog and unleash it. Let your dog follow the scent trail until it finds the treat.Once the dog finds the treat, reward and praise it accordingly.

, Do this in many short sessions, gradually moving to dry treats as the dog gets better. Frequency is more important than length of the training, as the dog will soon see the pattern and begin to expect, then know, what to do next.Focus on short, but frequent, training sessions that will help your dog learn how to react and what you expect from it.

, When your pup is very young, try to make as much noise around it as possible. Start slow so as not to scare your pup and build your way up to louder noises. You want your dog to grow up being accustomed to a variety of loud noises, voices, and sounds.Once you are ready to start training your dog in the field, start bring the gun with you on walks. Then move forward to firing some shots while the dog is far away in the field looking for birds.
Continue this practice while you keep getting closer and closer to the dog.
Begin with a quieter handgun (like a .22 pistol) and then work your way up to a louder shotgun.
Make sure your dog sees your guns on a regular basis before you start training it for hunting. You don’t want the first association the dog has with the gun to be the loud noise it makes.

, To start the transition from treats to animals, you’ll need to spend some time practicing with your dog. Hide some birds in the open field and let your dog track them on its own. Allow your dog to bite and play with the bird the first few times so that it gets used to the sensation of the bird in its mouth.Once your dog has started getting used to the procedure, you can incorporate some gun shots in to the tracking routines so that your dog begins to associate the sound of the gun with the hunt for the birds (or other animals).

, One of the most important commands to teach a hunting dog is the “hold” command. This means that the dog should hold the prey in its mouth until you come to physically remove it.Begin teaching your dog while it is right next to you. Tell your dog to “hold” until you are satisfied. Keep moving farther and farther away each time you practice. The dog should only stop holding when you have reached its location and have taken the prey out of its mouth yourself.
Once he has mastered this command, you can switch to “release” which will indicate to your dog that you want it to drop the prey out of its mouth.
Be sure to use positive reinforcement while teaching this command.

Move your King Pawn to d3.,
Move your Queen Pawn forward to e4.,
Move the White Queen to h5 (Qh5).",How to Checkmate in 3 Moves in Chess2," This is a very similar method to the previous one. You are basically aiming to get your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns forward one and two squares respectively, while freeing your Queen to enable it to move onto h5. The end result is the same as the previous method.









You are trying to tempt your opponent to move her Bishop and Knight Pawns.
You need you opponent to respond by bringing out her Bishop Pawn one square to f6.
It can also work if she moves her Knight Pawn forward two squares on this turn, as long as she moves the Bishop Pawn on her next move.

, The next move for you to make has to free up your Queen so it can get into a checkmate position on the next move. To do this, move the White King Pawn ahead two squares to e4. Now you have opened up an avenue for your Queen to reach h5.









In order to clear the way to your opponent's King you need her to move her Knight Pawn ahead two spaces to g5.

, Checkmate! And that's it, you have trapped your opponent's King in the same position as the previous method, but this time you did it without even capturing a single piece. Game. Set. Match. Over.








Again, this looks simple and it is. So don't expect it to work very often!
In theory, there are loads of variations on this. The key moves are getting your Queen to h5, and your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns out of the way of her King.

Hold your breath.When you hold your breath, you stop your diaphragm from moving normally.,
Change your body position.,
Drink a glass of water quickly.When you drink quickly and without stopping, your abdominal muscles are put to work and your hiccups might end in the process.,
Try coughing.Coughing forcefully uses a lot of abdominal muscle power, and the action might halt the hiccup reflex.,
Put pressure on the bridge of your nose.Place your finger on the bridge of your nose and press as hard as you can.,
Make yourself sneeze.Sneezing puts abdominal muscles to work, which can break up the hiccupping action and hopefully end it.,
Gargle with water.Gargling requires you to concentrate, and the action can disrupt the way you are breathing and using your abdominal muscles.,
Drink a shot of vinegar.Strong substances like vinegar or pickle juice can “shock” your body into a bout of hiccups.,
Ice the problem.Take a small bag of ice and place it on the skin of your upper stomach, which is near your diaphragm.,
Stimulate the vagus nerve.The vagus nerve is related to a number of bodily functions, and stimulating it can help end your hiccups.,
Seek medical treatment if your hiccups last more than 48 hours.",How to Get Rid of Hiccups When You Are Drunk1," Since hiccups seem to be associated with a reflex movement of the diaphragm, halting it can help to end them.


After holding your breath for a few seconds, swallow large breaths of air a few times. Repeat this process a few times to see if it can stop your hiccups.;
, Sit while pulling your knees up to your chest or bending over will compress your diaphragm.Hiccups are related to diaphragm spasms, and compressing the diaphragm may reduce the spasms.


Be careful getting up and down--remember that your coordination and sense of balance might be impaired when you are drinking.

,


You can use a straw or two to help you drink the water more quickly.
Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups.

, Even if you don’t actually have to cough, just make yourself do it.

, It’s not clear why this technique works, but putting pressure put on a nerve or blood vessel often seems to help.

, To make yourself sneeze, try sniffing a little pepper, breathing in a dusty area, or walking out into bright sunshine.

, All of this together can help end a bout of hiccups.

, However, if you already have them, they may also “shock” your body into ending them.


If this method does not work the first time, it is probably best not to try it again, since drinking too much vinegar can irritate your stomach and esophagus. If it doesn’t work, just try a different method.

, The cold can cause changes in your circulation and muscle activity in the area, which might stop the hiccups.


If your hiccups do not go away within twenty minutes, remove the ice and try a different method. Leaving the ice on too long can cause soreness.

, Try one of these tricks:


Let a spoonful of sugar slowly dissolve on your tongue.
Eat a spoonful of honey.Tickle the roof of your mouth with a cotton swab.Stick your fingers in your ear.
Sip water (or some other non-alcoholic, non-carbonated beverage) slowly, letting it hit the roof of your mouth., Typically, you can cure hiccups with home remedies. However, if your hiccups last longer than two consecutive days and you've tried treating them at home already, it's time to see your doctor."

Place birds in a box, not a cage.,
Place their shelter in a dark, quiet place.,
Keep the bird warm.,
Allow the bird plenty of rest.,
Give baby birds space to move as they become fledglings.",How to Take Care of a Wild Bird3," Wild birds are not domesticated like house birds. A cage may alarm them, and they can injure themselves in an attempt to escape. Ventilated boxes lined with towels are actually best for birds, especially adult birds who have lived in the wild their whole lives. The dark calms them, and the enclosed space gives them a sense of protection against predators.Make sure you poke air holes in the box.


Remember this will only a temporary solution for keeping birds. The end goal to caring for wild birds is to reintroduce them into the wild, not to keep them as pets.

, Birds will be quiet as they recover so do not be alarmed if they do not sing or chirp in the box. In fact, the quieter their shelter, the better it will be for their healing.If the bird is an adult, you should keep the box outside as far away from the house as possible.
Baby birds should be kept close to you for constant supervision. You may choose to keep them inside or outside. If you do choose to leave their shelter outside, make sure that they remain close to the house, and give them an insulated shelter for warmth and protection.

, Especially if the bird you have rescued is a baby, you will want to keep the bird warm. There are a few methods you can use to warm a bird bed. If the bird is an adult, it may only need towels and grass shavings for warmth. If the bird is an unfeathered chick, it will need a more substantial source of warmth.You can pour warm water in a bottle and wrap it in paper towels. You may also want to put paper towels around the bird so that this doesn't burn them. This is a good option if you are keeping the bird outside.
Alternatively, you may make a bed of towels or old t-shirts in a pet carrier. Place the bird inside. Leave a heating pad beneath the carrier on throughout the day and night. The heating pad should warm the entire carrier.This is ideal if you are keeping the bird inside.

, If it curls up and isn't moving, it's not dead! It's sleeping, and this bird needs to sleep. It will tell you when it's awake and hungry again. Make sure you stay nearby when they're sleeping; they will need your absolute attention when they wake up.

, After a few weeks, you will notice the bird has sprouted more feathers. The bird will also start flapping its wings and shuffling around on its own. It is becoming a fledgling. It is extremely important in this stage that the bird has room to move around as it will be learning to fly. Supervise the bird carefully but give him room to move.


To ensure successful reintroduction into wild, take the chick outside once or twice a day. Hold the nestling in your hands, and if they try to fly off, don’t stop them. This exercise will strengthen their muscles and help them learn to fly. As time goes by, they will fly away for farther distances and longer periods of time but may still return for feedings.To prevent injury inside the home, you can teach the fledgling to avoid mirrors and windows. Hold the bird up to the glass and allow them to poke their beak against it. Do this repeatedly to teach the bird to avoid these as they learn to fly."

Practice using different mediums.,
Draw using different techniques.,
Determine which subject you like to draw the most.,
Express yourself in your drawings.,
Establish your line style.,
Determine the colors you'll use.",How to Develop Your Own Drawing Style2," Different mediums can open your eyes to new styles of art and inspire your current style. If you are always drawing in only one medium, consider switching to one that you don't use often. For instance, if you always draw in pencil or pen, consider changing to something like pastels or charcoal. While you'll have to adjust your technique to draw, it could inspire your overall style.You can also try doing other art forms like sculpture or painting if you feel like you have illustrator's block.

, Sometimes artists can get caught up drawing using a particular technique, and it limits their body of work. For instance, if you're always used to drawing in an anime style, it could be holding you back from discovering other things you like to draw. Think outside of the box and draw inspiration from innovative artists around you.


Other styles include photorealism, surrealism, abstraction, and manga.If you always draw cartoony, try to draw something realistic.
Drawing in different styles can help hone your skills.

, Different illustrators enjoy drawing different things. Some artists prefer to concentrate on the human form while others prefer to sketch inanimate objects or landscapes. In addition, other illustrators like to draw architecture and some like to draw designs for clothes. Think of what you are trying to get out of your illustrations and decide on the subject matter that you like the most.


Some artists are best known for drawing a particular subject, such as Georgia O'Keeffe who is best known for her distinct paintings of flowers., Think of your emotions and favorite themes while you draw and try to translate that into your art. For example, if you want to convey dark emotions, you can portray that in your art by drawing serious subject matter like a violent or depressing scene. Show your frustration by using sharp, jagged lines. If you want to portray a serene scene, using sweeping bright colors and pick subject matter that will inspire people.


Try doing quicker concept pieces instead of obsessing over getting something perfect if you are having a hard time completing a drawing. Try taking thirty or fewer seconds to draw something. Aim to get the form and idea of your subject matter, rather than drawing the minute details.
Many artists stick to similar themes, colors, lines, and drawing techniques which distinguish their style from other artists.If you have a block in inspiration, concentrate less on achieving a unique style and focus more on getting your emotions out on paper.

, Once you've established the medium, you'll be working in and the subject matter, it's time to set yourself apart visually. Think about your line thickness and how you'll be using your lines within your work. Ask yourself if you like drawing thick bold lines or would rather draw more intricate and detailed lines. Also determine if your lines are going to be short, sharp, and jagged, or smooth and long. Will your lines be dark and make the outline the focal point, or are colors and details more important for you?


Vary your line width throughout a drawing, but try to maintain a cohesive style overall.
The way you outline your drawings will influence your style heavily., As an illustrator, color can sometimes play a huge role in the emotions and feelings you can evoke from an illustration. Often, darker tones like dark blue and black and can create an ominous feeling in a drawing while lighter tones like yellow, red, and orange can evoke positive emotions.The intensity and method of application also significantly change the way your drawing turns out.


Decide whether color will even play a role in your illustrations as some artists prefer to draw in black and white.
You may choose to color your drawings with paint, pastels, or colored pens, or scan them and do color edits in a software program.

Expect that the child will try to control the situation.,
Maintain consistent, predictable schedules and routines.,
Set expectations and boundaries.",How to Work With a Child With Reactive Attachment Disorder1," A child with RAD has likely had an uncertain, neglected past. For example, the child may not have been fed regularly as an infant, or bounced around from foster care settings so frequently that they never felt secure. As a result, they constantly make attempts to “control” their environment through their behavior.They may manipulate others, rather than genuinely connect with them, because of this need to control.Other controlling behaviors you might see include:


Aggressive behavior and outbursts.Clinginess and constant need for attention.
Nonstop chattering.;
, A child with RAD may have not had much consistency as a baby or toddler. It is very important, both from a behavior management standpoint, as well as the child’s own emotional health, that the child know what to expect every day. Creating a routine for a child helps the child feel safe, cared for, and more relaxed.Let the child know the day’s schedule, then stick to it. For example, you could say, “Today you are going to school. After school, we’ll go to the park, then work on homework, then take a bath.”
If the child can read, write the day’s schedule in a visible place. You could also draw pictures for a young child.
Keep the routine consistent. Kids learn from making sense of patterns in their lives. They’ll understand what is next and understand the behavior expected of them. They will also be less stressed because they know what is coming and how to deal with it.Give the child as much notice as possible if there is going to be a change in the routine. For example, “Next Saturday you’re not going to swimming class as usual, because it is Kyle’s birthday party. We’re going to Kyle’s house instead.” You could get out a calendar and show the child how many days away it is.Do your best to avoid changes in routine with RAD children. It can be too stressful on them and you may notice a backslide in their behavior.

, Be clear in establishing rules and expectations.Kids with reactive attachment disorder will find loopholes in rule enforcement and may argue with you, so you need to be clear and firm up front.


Make the child aware of consequences that will occur if he or she disobeys rules, and follow through with your stated consequences. This can help the child understand that they do have control over certain situations, because they can control their behavior to avoid repercussions.
Consider creating a contract with the child that indicates rules, expectations, and consequences for not following the rules. Keep the contract in an easily accessible place for reference.Keep in mind that a contract is a mutual agreement. Let the child have a say in the rules and the consequences to help them take control of their behavior.
For example, your contract could say, “Charlie agrees to the following rules: 1) Cleaning his room once a week. 2) No fighting with his brother and sister. 3) Following directions the first time they are given. If Charlie does not follow these rules, he will not be allowed to play video games for 24 hours.” You may also want to specify a reward for following the rules to help provide your child with some positive reinforcement. For example, “If Charlie follows the rules, then he will get to play with his favorite toy.”

Consider the kind of scent you'd like to add to candles.",How to Make Scented Candles1," There is a wide variety of choices, but not all of them will align with your personal preferences. Some are commercially produced from chemicals, some come from plants, while others are based on essential oils. The origin of the scent may impact your choice to use it, especially if you're concerned about chemicals in your home environment. Typical sources of scenting candles include:


Commercial candle making scents: These are in liquid form and are available from most stores that sell candle making supplies. The strength of the scent will vary from brand to brand and whether or not you have access to a full list of ingredients will depend on the manufacturer's willingness to provide this. Expect to use about 1 ounce of liquid scent to every 2 pounds of melted wax.
Fragrance oils: These are 100% synthetic and are not specifically made for candles but usually still work for scenting them. The same issues as the commercial scents apply. Most are highly concentrated, so use of these should be sparing. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of fragrance oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Essential oils: These are produced naturally from plants such as herbs and flowers. They have specific properties, which can be found by doing an online search or using a book on essential oils. Not all essential oils will work well with wax, so you may need to do a test first. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of essential oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Natural sources of scent: This covers such things as crushed or powdered plants, spices and herbs, finely ground zest, etc. Some work really well with melted wax, such as ground cinnamon, crushed lavender flowers or finely ground lemon zest. Others may not meld as well though, or can stop the wax from turning hard or prevent the wick from burning, so do your research first. Expect to use about 1 teaspoon of ground spice, herb or zest per 1 pound of wax.;

Don't wear plaid pants unless you're supremely confident.",How to Wear Plaid," Plaid comes in many different colors and styles. However, its crisscrossing lines mean it's almost always fairly attention-grabbing. This means pairing multiple pieces of plaid clothing with each other can be overwhelming or ""busy"" to look at.


There's one exception to this rule. If you have one plaid accessory (like a scarf, purse, hat, pair of shades, etc.) that's designed to match your main plaid piece, you can usually get away with wearing both together.;
, This is a great ""go-to"" style choice when you're trying to add plaid to your wardrobe. Solid colors offer simple contrast to the complicated interwoven patterns of plaid. On top of this, neutral tones are versatile in terms of which plaid patterns they can pair with. Not every plaid shirt will pair with bright yellow chinos, for instance, but most will pair with a simple pair of jeans or khakis quite nicely.



Neutral colors include: White, black, khaki, muted blue denim, grey, and most browns and beiges., You don't always have to wear plaid with neutral tones. However, if you want to wear plaid with colored clothes, try to pick a plaid piece with one color that is close to the other color in your outfit.


For example, if you're wearing a set of bright blue jeans, you might wear a plaid shirt that includes a few stripes that are a similar shade of blue. The colors don't have to match exactly — light blue can go with dark blue and so on., Today, clothing sellers offer plaid garments in a huge variety of colors and shades. This means that you have lots of freedom when it comes to assembling your outfit. As long as you're following the color-matching rules above, there aren't any strict rules here, but a few general suggestions are below.



Brighter, more flowery shades tend to be best for casual events and warmer months.

Darker, more muted shades tend to be more formal and more appropriate for colder weather. For example, you would probably not wear pink plaid to a job interview, but navy blue plaid might work well.

Intricately-stitched patterns can give an upscale, intellectual vibe, especially when paired with a smart jacket and nice shoes.

Simple, bright-colored plaids give a very rugged, blue-collar impression. For example, Paul Bunyan and other ""traditional"" lumberjacks are often depicted in bright red and black plaid shirts.

, Plaid is the name of the pattern (not the material) so you can find plaid items in a variety of materials. In general, you'll want to find something that's just right for the weather outside — not too hot, not too cold. A few seasonal suggestions are below:



Spring: Light cotton or flannel shirts, umbrellas, stockings, hats, shoes.

Summer: Light cotton shirts (tied around waist when hot), skirts, shorts, jumpers, tees.

Autumn: Heavier flannel shirts, rain boots, trench coats, hats.

Winter: Heavy flannel shirts, jackets, boots, scarves.

, Not all plaids are created equal. Though all plaids use the famous crisscross pattern, a huge variety of colors, styles, and sizes are available. A few pattern suggestions are listed below:Tartan: Large, old-fashioned looking pattern. Usually dark green background with navy blue, yellow, and red crisscrosses. Good for scarves, blankets.

Tattersall: Small, tight, square patterns. Thin lines of color on a neutral background. Looks very clean and modern. Works well for semi-casual dress shirts.

Madras: Wide, colorful striped pattern. Usually incorporates bright, ""flowery"" colors. Good for flowing garments like dresses or loose flannel shirts.

Gingham: Two-color ""checkerboard"" pattern. Thick, regular stripes. Works well for a retro, folksy look.

, Your outfit is more than your top and bottom garments. Wearing plaid accessories is a great way to give a burst of color to outfits that are dying to look a little more vibrant. However, remember that it's not a good idea to wear more than one piece of plaid at once unless the pieces match exactly.



Possible plaid accessories include: hats, scarves, stockings, socks, purses, backpacks, shades, neckties, bowties, handkerchiefs, and much more.

, Women's flannel shirts can offer a wide range of fashion possibilities depending on how they fit and how you wear them. Pick the style that gives the impression you want to broadcast to the world! See below:Loose plaid shirts tend to appear more ""rugged"" and casual. Try pairing one with a band T-shirt or an old tank top for a grungy sense of style. You can even wear men's shirts and let the tails hang below the waist for a ""boyfriend"" look.

Fitted plaid shirts and blouses tend to appear more ""put-together"" and professional. These are great for a semi-casual look at the home or the office.

, Love your plaid shirt but can't figure out how to work it into your outfit? There's no rule that says you have to wear it as a shirt. Try tying it around your waist as a sash or belt to add a line of bright color to your outfit that attracts attention to your waist.


As an alternative, you can tie your shirt in a loop and wear it diagonally across your chest or tie the sleeves around your neck like a sweater.

, This easy look is fantastic as an ""anywhere"" outfit. Pair it with a set of a clean (yet casual) shoes like flats for a touch of refinement or try sneakers for spunky style.


You may want to keep jewelry and flashy accessories to a minimum with this outfit. These sorts of additions can clash with the casual aims of the rest of your clothes.

, It's also easy to use plaid to give the opposite impression. Try wearing a fitted plaid tunic or dress over a pair of dark leggings. Then, wrap a scarf or belt around your waist and add a few gold accessories, such as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings, for a touch of class. Finish it off with a pair of fashionable heeled boots. You'll have red carpet style on a fraction of the budget.

, No one's too old for this playful yet traditional outfit. Start by picking a plaid skirt with muted colors like navy glue, forest, green, or a neutral color. Then, pair it with a plain white button-down shirt for simple elegance. Wear a pair of black knee-high socks and throw on some simple black flats to complete the look.

, Women have tons of awesome options when it comes to plaid accessories. Look for a plaid handbag, scarf, or belt at your favorite outlet. Then, for maximum impact, add the accessory to a simple plaid-free outfit that only uses solid prints like to a white t-shirt and jeans. The contrast between the accessory and the rest of your clothes will naturally make it an eye-catcher.


Some famous labels, like Burberry, offer iconic plaid patterns on their accessories. These are great, but you don't have to spend lots of money to get this look. The visual contrast is what's important, not the price tag.

, When it comes to plaid fashion for men, the idea of ""ruggedness"" is a popular one. To get this rugged, masculine look, pick a long-sleeved flannel shirt in traditional colors, like red and black or gray and black. Wear it with your most comfortable jeans and a pair of hiking boots. That's all you need!


White or black tees are the perfect undershirts for this no-frills outfit. You can even try showing off a hairy chest by wearing a tank top — if you're going for the lumberjack look, you might as well flaunt it!

, Brighter plaids aren't just for women. Bright plaid flannels go good with a tee shirt and jeans or shorts for a casual beach-bum look. Alternatively, pair a bright plaid dress shirt with a pair of khakis or grey dress pants for a bold, semi-formal outfit.

, Depending on their fit, a pair of plaid shorts can have a wide range of effects. Try picking either a baggy or fitted pair of shorts depending on the situation. See below:



Baggy plaid shorts usually give a more casual, relaxed impression. Pair with a fitted tee or a solid dress shirt for best results.

Fitted plaid shorts usually give a slightly classier impression. They're still more casual than pants, but they're more connected to ""upper-crust"" sports activities like golf. Try pairing with a solid-color polo.

, Sometimes a small amount of tie in the right place can make a big impression. If you only want a subtle hint of plaid in your outfit, put on a plaid print tie the next time you wear a suit. The pattern will liven up your style without looking too tacky or overdone. Both neck ties and bow ties work well. However, plaid ties aren't usually appropriate for especially formal events.


Be sure to use a subdued, solid-color shirt under the tie. Patterned shirts can make your upper body look very ""busy"" when paired with a complicated plaid tie.

, Using plaid patterns for suits is do-able, but only if the plaid pattern is a subtle one. Suits that are bold about their plaid patterns are a relic of the 1970s. They can be visually distracting at best and can make you look like a game show host at worst. Pick plaid suits with very thin, subtle stitching and neutral colors to play things safe.


As a general rule, if a plaid suit looks like a solid color suit until you get close to it, it's probably safe.

, This is worth repeating. One of the very worst things you can do with plaid is to wear lots of it. The best plaid outfits generally have one prominent plaid item. Outfits that do use multiple plaid items generally have them matching exactly and use neutral tones to keep the plaid from overwhelming the outfit, but even this is a difficult feat to pull off.


Pairing two different kinds of plaid in the same outfit is almost always a bad idea. With the complex, interlocking patterns of the plaid and the many colors involved, it's almost impossible to get the two items to match. Even if you do, the effect can be overwhelming.

, Though it isn't always outright informal, plaid isn't usually considered especially dignified. There are usually much better choices for dressing respectfully. Unless you've been given special dress code instructions, it's better to stick to a suit, tuxedo, dress, or gown for events like weddings, funerals, and so on.


A good rule of thumb is this: if the event is something you feel like you need to wear a suit or dress for, don't wear plaid (even if it's part of your suit or dress).

, For the same reason that it's a bad idea to wear multiple different kinds of plaid, you won't usually want to wear plaid along with bright colors (either prints or solid colors). For instance, pairing plaid with neon-colored fabric is sure to make your outfit an over-complicated eyesore. Remember: neutral tones are your friends when it comes to plaid.

, One of the best things about plaid is that it's easy to get great-looking plaid prints for cheap at thrift stores. Plaid gets a somewhat appealing ""weathered"" look as it ages. This makes a plaid shirt that was once intended as semi-formal wear or work clothing, for instance, perfect for a ""grungy"" ensemble in a few decades' time. Save money on your next shopping trip by visiting a second hand store and digging around for these sorts of plaid bargains.

, For reasons that are difficult to define, bold plaid pants often look bizarre and distracting even when a shirt of the same print would not. While haute couture fashion models may be able to pull off plaid pants, 99% of the world's population can't, so you'll probably want to steer clear.

Wash your hands vigorously after cutting.",How to Cut Beef," Beef can be purchased at a butcher's shop or grocery store. For the sake of learning proper cutting, you should buy a cut with visible muscle, or ""grain"". The beef you use should depend on the meal you're preparing.


""Grain"" refers to the direction of the major muscle fibers on a cut of meat. It's not so important while you're cooking, but it's a crucial thing to consider when you cut the beef.The smaller the grain on the beef, the less important the slice's angle is. Cuts such as filet mignon or New York strip have softer muscle by definition, so slicing these types of meat may be a bit easier and more forgiving. If you are having difficulty learning to slice beef properly, these cuts are well suited for you.;
, Handwashing is a vital part of cooking preparation. Wash your hands with a disinfecting soap and lather them in water for at least 30 seconds. This will make sure you don't bring germs onto the food you're working with.


If you're handling uncooked meat at any point, make sure to wash your hands again afterwards.

, Lovers of steak all have their preferences when it comes to the degree of cooking. Ranging from rare (pink in the middle) to well-done (completely cooked), the level of cooking has a major effect on taste and texture. You can cook beef before or after it's been cut.


Different degrees of cooking, such as rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, and well done can also affect the meat's tenderness. Generally speaking, the longer you cook the meat, the less tender it is. Most steak lovers prefer medium rare as it offers an optimal balance.

, This allows the juices to redistribute inside your steak, which relaxes the muscle. Slicing steak prematurely allows these juices to escape.


Resting time should vary based on the cut and size of your beef. A roast, for example, should be allowed to rest for 10 minutes, while steaks should be given 5 to settle.Generally speaking, 1 minute of resting time per 100g of meat is a good rule if you're unsure how much time to let your beef idle., The ""grain"" of a cut of beef refers to the direction of major muscle fibers. You can usually see the direction visibly on beef, although less gamey cuts (like filet mignon) make be less clear. It's important to know where the grain is before cutting as you'll want to cut across the muscle. You'll increase the tenderness of your cut by severing the fibers.


Certain recipes might actually welcome some roughness in the meat, so long as the meat cuts are bite-sized. If this is the case, feel free to cut with the grain.
Don't confuse grill marks with the grain. Grill marks are the cooking lines that show where the steak was placed on the grill. Backyard cooks can sometimes confuse the grill marks as grain lines.

, For the sake of traction, safety, and protecting your countertop, it's recommended you put your meat on a cutting board before you do anything to it. This will minimize the risk of anything going astray while you're working on it., This includes connective tissue, which is often seen on the exterior of a cut of meat. Muscle (and fat) are both usually visibly distinct from the rest of the cut. Hold the beef with one hand, and cut the muscle by sawing it back at forth with a knife. When it's cut off, discard it away from the meat you're preparing.


Don't hack away at the muscle if you're losing too much beef.
If your beef has a lot of muscle on the outside, it's a good idea to cut it off before you cook.

, Different cuts carry different degrees of fat, and some recipes actually favour a bit of beef fat along with the steak. However, for certain dishes (like stir fry), the fat should be removed.It's ultimately up to you whether you'd prefer a lean or marbled cut. Too much fat can pose a health issue, but it does capture a lot of flavour.


This can be done prior to cooking the meat. If you do so before cooking, you're likely to get the cleanest possible cut.

, Take a ruler and measure out pieces of the beef. From there, make noticeable incisions. These will be a placemarker for you when you make each of the cuts, and save you having to bring out the ruler for each time.


Again, it is important to remember you want to mark your cuts against the grain of the muscle fibres.

, A meat fork helps ensure that your piece of beef won't slip while you're cutting it. This helps ensure your cut is smooth. More importantly, it limits the risk of the knife slipping and causing injury., Because a proper beef cut should be smooth, the only mindwork you'll need to do is with positioning the knife itself. Aim the far end of your knife for the far end of the meat, aiming it downward at an angle. Think of the knife as a guillotine or a paper cutter. When you begin to cut the beef, you'll want to keep the knife is the exact same position.


Having a proper butcher's knife makes the process of cutting beef a lot smoother. If you're regularly preparing meat in your cooking, it's a good idea to invest in a high-end knife set. Other utensils, like forks, don't usually warrant the same quality.

, Properly cutting beef should be a very smooth process. Push the knife down gently, rocking it back and forth slowly. Provided your knife is sharp enough, you shouldn't need a lot of force to do this. Keep working downward until the slice is severed from the rest of the cut. Set the beef aside, and move on to the next segment until you're done.


Again, don't forget to cut against the grain. This has an important effect on the meat's texture., Aesthetics during mealtime are often underrated, but they have a big impact on the way food is received. If you're serving multiple pieces of meat per dish, it's a good idea to serve them together. If you're bringing the beef out on a platter, it can be appetizing to reassemble them in the shape of the original cut. This increases the impression of freshness.

, Raw beef is notoriously difficult to cut. However, you can alleviate some of the strain by placing the beef in the freezer. Partially freezing beef firms up the meat, making it easier to work with.Put your meat in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. The extra time you put into preparing it will make the cutting process that much easier for you.

, One thing about cutting beef while raw is that you're able to cut off potentially unwanted parts (like muscle and fat) without their flavour sinking into the rest of the cut during the cooking process. Slide your knife under the surface fat and take it off in a smooth motion. Take care not to go too deep with your cuts. Getting too aggressive with your fat trimming will result in the loss of good meat.Membrane is a fine film over parts of some cuts, and can be peeled off with your hands.Consider leaving some of the fat on your cut. Even if you want to keep your beef lean, a bit of fat will keep your cut of beef juicy.

, If you haven't yet cooked your beef, it's all the more important that you make your cuts consistent. If you're cutting pieces of different sizes, they'll cook at different rates.This will run the risk of undercooking (or overcooking!) parts of your beef.


It helps to mark your cuts beforehand. Because consistent size is so important with pre-cooked cutting, you should get the measurements done before you set a knife to your beef.

, Although raw beef is generally harder to cut, pre-freezing it partially helps ease some of the difficulty.

, If you plan on cutting the beef before cooking it, only cut it if you're planning on cooking immediately after. Slicing in advance will increase oxidation and make the meat taste off., Raw beef carries lots of bacteria with it. Whenever you're handling raw meat, it is strongly recommended you wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Lather your hands with anti-bacterial soap under hot water for at least 30 seconds. Dry your hands off with a towel afterwards.

You're more likely to get a purer product. For example, if you're looking for essential oils, contact a company that primarily produces essential oils. Always read labels which should tell you the name of the product, where it came from, how it was produced, when it expires, and whether it's organic or certified.If you're having trouble finding what you need, look online.
Many online retailers also sell containers, tins, and bottles specifically for skincare products.;
, Many homemade skincare products contain herbs, oils, or other natural ingredients that can cause side effects in some people. Anytime you make your own skincare products, be on the lookout for any symptoms. If you notice symptoms, stop using your product and see a doctor if it doesn't quickly clear up. Side effects of natural skincare products include:Irritation
Redness or blotchy skin
Itchy scaling skin
Breakouts
Chemical burns

, If you know you're allergic to certain products in conventional skincare products, avoid using them even if you prepare them in natural skincare products. For example, if you're allergic to tea tree oil toner, avoid making any skincare products with tea tree essential oil.Other natural ingredients that commonly cause allergies in people include: tea tree oil, feverfew, lavender, and jasmine.

, Since homemade skincare products don't contain preservatives, you'll probably need to refrigerate some of them or toss them after a few days. This is especially important if the product is based on a food item because it could begin growing fungus, bacteria, or yeast.If your product is water or food based, you should refrigerate it and use it within three days.

, If making your own skincare products using recipes seems intimidating, you can easily swap out natural items for skincare products you'd normally purchase. For example, try using:Pure coconut oil instead of lotion
Diluted apple cider vinegar instead of facial toner
Olive oil instead of mascara remover

, Just because a product claims that it's natural doesn't necessarily make it good for you. On the other hand, just because a product sounds unnatural doesn't make it bad for you. It's important to research the ingredients in your skincare products, especially if you don't know what it is or what it does.


For example, vitamin E is also known as tocopherol and vitamin D is also known as cholecalciferol.

, Since there are no government databases that research and share skincare product information, use the EWG database. This searchable database lists recommendations on what to avoid, what's in your skincare products, and the toxicity levels of products. Since the terms ""natural"" and ""all-natural"" aren't regulated, you should find out exactly what's in your skincare products. Other good databases or apps to use include:


Environmental Working Group database: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/

Think Dirty app: http://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/

GoodGuide database: http://www.goodguide.com/


, Many fragrances (listed as ""parfum"") contain chemicals (phthalates) which are associated with possible birth defects, cancer, allergic skin reactions and other health problems. You should also avoid plastic packaging since it can release chemicals into your skincare product. Choose products in packaging like PET (with recycling code #1) and HDPE (#2) since these are considered to be the safest plastics.Avoid polycarbonate (#7) which contains the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA) and avoid PVC (#3) which contains a variety of heavy metals, phthalates and chemicals.
Essential oils are a better natural way to add fragrance to a product since they don't contain phthalates.

, Since skincare products are not heavily regulated, research the company to find out their specific policies. Some companies have signed a Compact for Safe Cosmetics which voluntarily pledges to remove any known or potentially harmful chemicals from their ingredients. You might want to find out:


If a company tests on animals
The company's mission statement
Whether or not the company is an environmentally conscious company

, Although organic products can still contain emollients, preservatives, and emulsifiers, they usually use the natural versions instead of harmful synthetic versions. Try to buy organic skincare products when you can and look for the USDA National Organic Program seal. This means that the product has been through a certification program.Biodynamic certification is an even higher standard for skincare products. Just look for for a biodynamic or Demeter seal of approval., You'll probably see that many products claim to be hypoallergenic (at a low risk of causing allergies). This term is unregulated so there's no research to support this claim. Instead, test a product by applying a coin-sized amount to the skin on your elbow crease. Do this in the morning and at night for up to a week to see if it irritates your skin. If it doesn't, you can use the product. If you see signs of irritation, avoid the product. Signs of irritation include:Small bumps
Redness
Swelling
Burning sensation

, You might be surprised to see products that claim to be natural might contain parabens. Parabens are chemicals used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in cosmetics. Parabens have been associated with cancer so check the label for any ingredients that list paraben as part of the name. For example, avoid methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben.You should also avoid other toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and petroleum products (including petroleum jelly, petrolatum, mineral oil and paraffin.)

, While many manufactured skincare products contain preservatives, the products do have a shelf life. Expired skincare products may not be as effective and may grow bacteria so it's important to toss your old skincare products. In general, throw out:Swipe-on pads after 2 months or when they dry out
Peels and masks after 3 months
Acne products after 4 months (consider refrigerating them)
Retinoid creams after 9 to 11 months
Sunscreens after one or two years
Moisturizing creams after 1 year
Grainy scrubs after 2 years

, Pregnancy is a sensitive time for your growing baby. While your baby is developing, exposure to chemicals from skincare products could cause health problems. This is why it's even more important to make or find natural skincare products. Try to cut back on wearing skincare products or cosmetics during pregnancy and avoid products that contain hormone disrupting chemicals if you're nursing.Common hormone disrupting chemicals include triclosan (found in hand sanitizers), parabens (found in skincare and cosmetic products), BPA, lead, and mercury., Use as few products with as few ingredients as possible. This way, if your skin reacts to something in a product, you'll easily be able to determine what ingredient caused the reaction. Also, the more ingredients in a product, the greater the chance that they may interact and cause health problems.


Teens use 17 products on average and adults use an average of 12 products a day. This can mean an average use of almost 170 different ingredients., Since babies and children are still developing, they're more sensitive to ingredients in skincare products. Try to cut back on the number of products you use on your babies or children since these have never been tested for safety in babies and children.Choose products with no fragrance since fragrances (parfum) can cause irritation or allergies in small children.
Minimize product use, but be sure to protect your kids. For example, apply sunblock, but remember to cover your child's head with a hat when you're all out in the sun.

Allow for differences in values.,
Appreciate their differences.,
See yourself from their eyes.",How to Like People2," Respect the fact that everyone grows up with different priorities. Recognize how your personal history has led you to develop your own unique set. Think of how this shapes your view of other people. Then consider how someone else’s personal history could lead them to adopt their own unique set of priorities. Understand that they aren’t any less likable just because they hold different values. For instance:A tragedy in your family might have impressed upon you the importance of maintaining strong ties. However, someone who grew up without any such tragedy might be more inclined to let family ties weaken over an issue that you consider minor.
On the other hand, you might consider something like skipping school a rite of passage because you never suffered from it, while someone else might think of it as a major mistake because of the serious consequences that they faced afterward.

, Remember: no one is perfect, including you. Instead of faulting people for not sharing your values, recognize how their own mindset can be a good thing, even if it seems contrary to yours. Appreciate the positive results that come from their unique approach toward life. For example:Your approach toward work might be to dive into it headfirst and stick with it until it is done, while your colleague or study buddy may have a more relaxed mindset. Instead of faulting them for being too eager to take a break, embrace the benefits of taking one. Appreciate how your partner has led you to an experience that you would have otherwise skipped on your own.
Say that you and Person B share very similar opinions. However, yours are shaped by your faith in your religion, while Person B, an atheist, has arrived at them on their own. Instead of faulting them for their lack of faith, appreciate how they have arrived at the same core values without any help from above.

, Don’t assume that your actions always make your line of reasoning absolutely clear for others to understand. Remember that people may be as equally puzzled by why you do certain things as you are by their own choices. Recognize when your conduct might confuse, offend, or alienate others. Then consider ways to compensate and build a better understanding between you. For instance:Say you are an introvert and quiet by nature. Person B, on the other hand, is very open and talkative. Although you wouldn’t be offended by someone simply nodding hello in the morning instead of starting a conversation, understand that Person B might. To compensate, meet them halfway. Compliment their appearance, comment on the weather, or offer any other small form of chitchat to put them at ease.
Now say the opposite: you are very talkative and Person B is very quiet. While you know that you are trying to start a conversation in order to be friendly, recognize that they might feel bullied into interacting. Again, meet them halfway. Say hello, ask how their weekend was, and then leave it up to them to continue talking or back out.

Choose the clips.,
Add a transition between clips.,
View the transition.",How to Add Video Transitions in Final Cut Pro," To make a transition, the first thing you need is something to transition to and something to transition from. Whether you are editing home movies or your film masterpiece, you need to add at least two scenes to the Final Cut Pro editing timeline.;
, To add a transition, you can either click on the effects tab in the Final Cut Pro browser or the effects button on the top of your program. Either way, you will want to click on the Video Transitions button. There will be many different types of transitions you can use, so experiment with which one works best for the job at hand. In order to add it to the timeline between the clips, drag it from the browser and drop it in between the two clips.


If you want to use the same type of transition between many clips, you can set the default transition of Final Cut Pro and add it to your entire project in one shot. To do this, right click the transition you want to use and select Set as Default. After doing this, you can click on the transition and drag it into the Final Cut Pro canvas and drop it in the Overwrite with Transition box. This will apply that transition to every clip in your timeline without making you do it one at a time. If you only want to add the default transition to a single pair of clips, you can select the area between the two and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T. This will insert the default transition in only that one place.

, In order to view the transition you've added between your clips, you will have to render the area effected by the transition. This will be denoted by a red line above that area in the time line. After rendering it, make sure the transition suits your clips, and if not go back and change it until it does.

Shut down the computer.,
Spray a little LCD or plasma cleanser on a microfiber cloth.,
Wipe the screen using the cloth.",How to Clean a Macbook Pro Screen3," Make sure that the Macbook Pro is turned off before proceeding. Detach the computer from its power adapter.


You should not proceed without detaching the computer. These components could get damaged if exposed to the wet cleanser. You could also get a slight shock if moisture reaches these electrical components as you work, especially if the power adapter is plugged in.







, Use a cleaner specifically sold for use with LCD screens.


Spray a small amount of this cleaner onto your soft cloth. Do not drench the cloth. It should only feel a little moist to the touch, and you should not be able to squeeze any liquid out of it.






Only use soft, lint-free, and static-free cloths. Lens cloths work especially well, but any microfiber cloth will usually do the trick. Avoid paper towels, dish towels, terry cloth towels, and other abrasive fabrics.






Only use cleaning products specifically created and sold for use with LCD screens.Do not use all-purpose cleaners, alcohol-based products, bleach, aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives. All of these products could seriously damage the screen. In extreme cases, the screen may even break completely.
Do not spray the cleaning solution directly on the screen. Doing so increases the likelihood of getting moisture into the openings at the bottom or along the sides. Moisture should not be allowed through these openings, since it can short out your computer if it gets inside.

, Pass the cloth over the Macbook Pro screen, working either from top to bottom or from side to side. Buff the screen in small circular motions, applying steady but light pressure.


Hold the computer screen near the very top or very bottom to reduce the risk of accidentally smudging it as you work.
Continue buffing the computer screen as necessary until all smudges are gone, reapplying cleaning solution as necessary. This may take several passes over the screen and several minutes to complete.

Rinse well.",How to Remove Hair Dye from Skin6," Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in an acetone-based nail polish remover. Wring slightly by squeezing it with your fingers to remove any excess.


The acetone in nail polish remover can be very abrasive and will remove the dyed, dead skin cells on top of your skin while also lifting up the dye.
Keep the nail polish remover away from your eyes.
Note that this method is risky to use with the sensitive skin of your face and may work better for hair dye stains on your hands.

,


Only rub the area a few times. Do not scrub and do not let the acetone soak your skin for long.
You should notice the dye lifting up almost immediately. If it does not, then nail polish remover may not work against your brand of hair dye.

, Thoroughly rinse the area with cool to warm water to rinse away all traces of the nail polish remover.


If some or all of the dye remains, try another method of removal.

Strip the insulation off both ends of a wire.,
Wrap the wire around the steel.,
Select a low-voltage battery.,
Use rubber gloves and rubber-handled tools.,
Connect the wire ends to the battery.,
Test the steel.",How to Magnetize Steel2," Using wire stripping pliers, strip about an inch (2.5cm) of insulation from each end of an insulated wire. You'll need enough wire to wrap around your steel object at least ten times.


""Enameled wire"" with thin insulation will have a stronger effect. Do not use bare wire without insulation, as this will interrupt the current and fail to work., Leaving a couple inches (several centimeters) of wire at each end, wrap the insulated portion around the steel. The steel will become more magnetic the more times you wrap the wire. Use at least ten loops for nails, and several dozen for larger objects.


Alternatively, wrap the wire around a heat-proof plastic tube large enough to insert your steel through.
If a regular magnet is not attracted to the steel, don't bother trying to magnetize it. Some types of stainless steel cannot be magnetized.

, An ordinary 1.5V or 3V battery will provide a safe, DC power source sufficient to magnetize nails or screws. Larger steel objects may require a higher voltage battery, but these will create more heat, and a more dangerous electrical shock if handled improperly. A 12V car battery can be used if it is removed from the vehicle and the safety precautions below are followed, but higher voltages are not recommended.



Never use an electrical outlet or other AC power supply, as the high voltage could blow your house fuse or create serious safety risks., These will prevent the electrical current from reaching you. Although low-voltage household batteries are harmless in this respect, you may want gloves anyway as the metal can get quite hot if left in the coil.

, Attach one of the stripped wire ends to the positive terminal of the battery. Attach the other wire end to the negative terminal of the battery. For small household batteries, wrapping the wire around a brass paper fastener will make it easier to keep them together. Place the fastener head on the battery so the wire makes contact, then use tape or rubber bands to attach the fastener arms to the side of the battery.An additional rubber band holding the fasteners in place lengthwise will make a more sturdy connection.


If using a higher-voltage battery, you may see sparks when the circuit is completed. Only hold the wire by the insulated portion.

, An electrical current flowing through the coil creates a magnetic field, which will magnetize any ferromagnetic metal placed inside it. If your variety of steel can be magnetized, it should be able to pick up small iron objects after a short time in the coil.


Putting magnetized steel through the coil a second time will demagnetize it again."

Apply the poultice to the affected area of skin, and leave it on the skin for as long as you need.Topical applications, including poultices and baths, can help with skin rashes and inflammation, including those from fungus., Another way to use chamomile topically is to take a bath. You will need significantly more flowers or essential oil for a bath. Simply draw a bath as normal, and add a 1/4 a pound of flowers to the bath. You can also use 10 drops or so of essential oil in a full bath. Then, soak in the bath as you normally would.You can also use chamomile tea bags if the tea is pure chamomile. You can leave them in the tea bags or open them up to get the flowers out.

, Another option is to apply a cream. You can find chamomile creams at natural health food stores or online. Look for creams that are about 10 percent or less chamomile. Apply the cream to the fungal skin or nail infection several times a day.You can also make your own cream by adding a few drops of chamomile essential oil to a cream-based lotion.

, For a vaginal yeast infection, you can add dried chamomile to honey.Even though honey is sugar and yeast eat sugar, honey is a known antifungal agent that yeast have a hard time eating.Place the mixture in your vaginal cavity, and leave it overnight. Wash it out in the morning.
You can add a few drops of cinnamon essential oil to help increase your chances of fighting the infection.

Do squats.,
Try weight shifts.,
Try a single leg balance.,
Incorporate a dumbbell.,
Join a class.,
Practice balancing in your downtime.,
Get stronger.",How to Improve Balance," The first step to improving your overall balance is to strengthen the muscles in your legs, calves, and thighs. This can be done through doing squats on a weekly basis.


Stand with your hips and knees wide apart. Keep your arms out, abs tight, and your back straight.Bend your knees and hips and slowly lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor. If you're not used to doing squats, you may not be able to get your thighs quite parallel so just get as close as possible.Slowly rise back up, contracting your glutes. Try to do three sets of 10, with a one minute break after each set.;
, Weight shifts are another exercise that address improving balance. It's a good exercise to start with if you're just beginning to work on improving your balance.


Stand, keeping your feet hip-length apart, and distribute your weight equally between both legs. Shift your weight to the right and lift your left foot off the floor. Hold this position as long as you can, aiming for around 30 seconds.Return to the original position and then repeat the exercise on the other side. Do as many repetitions as you can without getting sore. As time goes on, you should be able to gradually increase the number of repetitions., Once you get used to doing squats and weight shifts, move on to move complicated exercises. A single leg balance will help you work on strengthening your lower body and improving overall balance.


Begin in the same position you used for the weight shifts, with legs hip-length apart and weight equally distributed.Place your hands on your hips, lift your left leg to the side, and bend your leg back at the knee. Hold this for 30 seconds and then return to the starting position.Repeat on the other side. Do as many repetitions as you are comfortable with and, with time, increase the number of repetitions., You can add strength training aspects to your exercises, which should further improve your balance and form. Using a dumbbell, you can do bicep curls.


The weight of the dumbbell depends on your fitness level. If you're not used to lifting weights, pick something in the five to 10 pound range to start off with. You can always add weight with time if this feels too easy.Hold the dumbbell in your left hand, keeping your palm facing upward. Stand with your legs hip-length apart and weight equally distributed. Lift your right leg off the floor and bend it back at the knee. Hold this pose for about 30 seconds.Return to the original position and then repeat on the other side. You can increase the number of repetitions and amount of weight as you become more fit., There are a variety of activities that promote good balance. Joining a yoga, Pilates, or tai chi class can help you improve balance.


Tai chi is a form of movement training that promotes coordination, strength, and balance. Many fitness and community centers offer tai chi classes. See what's available in your area by browsing the yellow pages, checking online, and looking for ads in the local paper. If there aren't classes offered in your area, you can buy or rent DVDs or find videos on YouTube that teach basic tai chi poses.Yoga and Pilates are both forms of exercises that promote strengthening core muscles by moving between a variety of poses. Yoga has the added benefit of teaching mindfulness and meditation. In addition to improving balance, yoga could reduce overall stress. Like tai chi, fitness and community centers may offer yoga and Pilates classes. You can also buy or rent DVDs or find instructional videos online., While you're doing day-to-day activities, practice balancing. Try to stand on one foot while brushing your teeth, waiting for a bus or train, doing your makeup or brushing your hair, and other daily activities., Your balance will improve greatly if you strengthen your buttocks, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Aerobic activities, like running and jogging can help. You can also engage in low impact weight training, like lifting weights at home or doing push ups, sit ups, squats, and other easy exercises to do without heavy equipment.Try incorporating a medicine ball into your workouts to build core strength.

Talk with a trainer or behaviorist.",How to Keep Small Pets Safe Around a New Dog1," Properly training your new dog is essential to ensuring your smaller animal’s safety. Making sure that your dog responds to verbal commands will enable you to have complete control over your animal. When it comes to introducing your animals, your dog needs to be able to respond to “sit” and “stay.”, You should visit your veterinarian before introducing any new animals into your home. You will want to make sure that the animals currently residing in your home can handle the stress of a new dog. Conversely, you want to make sure that your new dog will be okay mixing with the animals in your house.Some breeds of dog are incapable of living with other animals. Make sure you research dog breeds before bringing home a new dog.
Smaller dogs, like Chihuahuas, tend to be very territorial and may not get along well with other animals.
Golden retrievers, Anatolian shepherds, great Danes, and other large dogs tend to get along well with other pets., A dog with behavior issues may need some professional help before you introduce it to the smaller animals in your home. A behaviorist or a trainer may be able to correct your dog’s behavior issues. However, some dogs are unable to adapt to life with smaller animals and should not be kept in close quarters with pets that they may hurt.If your dog has some behavior issues, be sure to talk with a professional before introducing it to other animals.

This includes cleaning products, solvents or automotive oils and lubricants. You should also keep any medications in a place that the puppy cannot reach., Because puppies are rambunctious animals, they are likely to bump into things and cause accidents. If you have any fragile objects in the area where your puppy will be living, you should move or find a way to secure those items. You do not want those things breaking or falling on the puppy and hurting it.Consider putting up gates to keep your puppy or puppies in a certain part of the house and moving your delicate objects somewhere else.

, Puppies love to chew on things, and one dangerous item that they sometimes chew on is electrical cords. These cords can shock, burn and even kill puppies that bite into them. Make sure that you properly hide or cover any cords in the area where your puppy will be living.


Consider covering the cords with duct tape or covering them with commercial cord concealers.
You may also want to cover any electrical sockets to prevent your puppy from getting electrocuted.

, In general, try to keep things off the floor or any other surfaces the puppy can reach. Puppies will chew on nearly anything, and sometimes they can choke on or get strangled in loose items around the house. Try to clean up your home so that it is clutter free once the puppy arrives.Put away any trashcans and make sure that rest have lids.
Put your clothes in hampers and keep all shoes on racks or in closets.

, If you have a backyard, you will want to fence it off. This will keep your puppy from running away and, once your puppy gets a little older, destroying other people’s property. It will also prevent any stray or wild animals from coming into your yard and hurting your puppy. Putting up a fence will give your puppy a safe space to play outside."

Avoid exercising with your allergens.",How to Exercise With Asthma," Walking is a great exercise for a large variety of people - including those with asthma. It's a low intensity activity that keeps your heart rate lower and doesn't cause deep or labored breathing.One study in particular showed that adults who walked three times a week showed improved fitness levels and had better control over their asthma after 12 weeks.Health and asthma professionals recommend doing a moderate to brisk walk a few times per week. However, you'll need to gauge how well you do with a moderate walk before advancing to more brisk or face paced walk.
Always warm-up before your walk and make sure to have your emergency inhaler handy just in case you need it. Aim for a 20–30 minute walk to start with if you're able. Work yourself up to longer times or a faster pace overtime.;
, You may think that swimming is a harder exercise to do aerobically; however, swimming is actually a recommended cardio activity for those suffering with asthma.Check to see if there's a pool in your area that you can use.


The reason that swimming is frequently recommended for asthmatics is because you're breathing in air that is highly humidified and warm. This is helps your lungs function better.
Try any type of water exercise that you have available. You can try water yoga, water aerobics, water walking or just swimming laps.
Aim for a 20–30 minute exercise session in the pool. If you notice your lungs do well and you can breathe well, you can consider increasing the length or intensity of your water exercises.

, Another great exercise for asthmatics is yoga. Its low-intensity and keeps your breathing and heart rate even. In fact, some yoga poses can help decrease some symptoms of asthma.A recent study showed that a beginner yoga class helped improve the quality of life of women who had asthma. Their symptoms were more manageable when they practiced yoga more regularly.If you currently do not exercise or haven't done yoga before, start with a beginners class or intro class. They're designed to fit all fitness levels.

, Like walking or yoga, leisurely biking is a low-intensity activity. It does not cause overly deep or heavy breathing and is easier on your cardiovascular system.Try to go for leisurely bike rides during the week. If you're physically fit enough you can aim for 45–60 minutes. If you haven't been exercising regularly, you may want to start out with 20–30 minutes of biking.
Competitive cycling or spin classes may trigger asthma symptoms. Make sure you are cleared by your doctor and have your emergency inhaler available if you try higher intensity cycling.

, Although long distance running or jogging can cause a flare in asthma symptoms, short jogs should be OK for most. Always talk to your doctor prior to beginning a jogging routine.


Health professionals agree that the types of exercises that can induce an asthma attack are high-intensity exercises, interval exercises or those activities that are done for a long period of time at a higher intensity.
Short bursts of moderate-intensity activities should be OK and are tolerated by most people with asthma.A short jog — about 20 or 30 minutes — can usually be tolerated well by someone who has asthma. If you are already active or can do 20–30 minutes of activity, a jog might be OK for you to try.
However, if your asthma frequently acts up with higher intensity exercises or is not well controlled, talk to your doctor before you start jogging.

, Whenever you have a chronic condition, it's important to speak to your doctor regularly and follow-up. With asthma, it's important to talk to your doctor about incorporating physical activity in a safe manner.


If you are not currently active, talk to your doctor about the appropriate way to include exercise in your weekly routine. Ask if there are activities you should avoid or if you should stick to any time limits.
Many doctors will also give you some tips on how to exercise safely and comfortably. For example, they may suggest swimming as a good exercise for you due to the humidity of the air.

, Asthma generally requires that you take medications regularly. Although there are no medications or procedures that can cure asthma, consistent medication use can prevent symptoms and provide a better quality of life.Many asthma medications work as you build up the medication in your body over time. Missing doses or being inconsistent can increase your risk of having symptoms or having an asthma attack. It is important that you follow the instructions and take your long-acting medications regularly to help prevent exacerbations, in addition to using your rescue inhaler for attacks.
Also make sure that you take your medications before doing any sort of exercise. This helps prevent symptoms from flaring during an aerobic activity.
If you're having regular symptoms but feel that you're taking your medication consistently and correctly, call your doctor immediately for follow-up.

, Asthma comes with very distinct signs and symptoms. When you suffer from asthma, it's essential that you know exactly how your body responds to medications and how it responds to triggers or allergens.Exercise can induce asthma symptoms in some people (generally referred to as exercise-induced asthma). Other people may respond to allergens like pollen or animal dander. Be aware of how much exercise or what activities typically set you off.
Also be aware of the signs of an asthma attack. Treating an attack quickly is imperative. Signs generally include: coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing (both inhaling and exhaling) and shortness of breath.
If you are consistently experiencing these symptoms when exercising, you need to see your doctor to talk about starting asthma medications or changing medications.

, If you're looking to add in exercise or increase your exercise, try to do activities that are either lower in intensity or ones you do in short bursts. These types of activities are better tolerated by those with asthma.Asthma typically flares up during more high-intensity exercise or exercises that you do for a longer period of time.
If you want to do more moderate-intensity exercises, like jogging, only do them for short periods of time. This may vary for everyone depending on their fitness level and how well controlled their asthma is.

, If you have asthma, you know it's important to have a rescue inhaler nearby. Symptoms can come at any time and you need to be prepared. Since exercise can trigger symptoms, bring your emergency medication with you.


Even if you've never experienced symptoms during exercise, it's essential that you keep your emergency inhaler available just in case you need it.
Keep an emergency inhaler in your gym bag or purse so that you can access it at the gym. If you're going for a jog, stick your emergency inhaler into a running pack to keep it on you.
Keep track of the expiration dates on all of your emergency medication. If you don't use these inhalers often, it might be easy to forget that they've expired. Check them regularly to make sure you have an up-to-date inhaler with you.

, Warm-up exercises are recommended before any type of physical activity. They get your body ready for a more intense session. This is especially important if you have asthma.


Warm-ups are intended to get your lungs, heart and muscles primed for exercise. With asthma, it's important to focus on warming up your lungs. You do not want to instantly increase your breathing rate as this could spark an asthma attack.
Warm-ups need to be for at least five to 10 minutes. It's best to do a slower or lower intensity version of the exercise you're planning on doing.
For example, walk for 10 minutes before doing a 20 minute jog. Or do water walking before starting to do laps.

, An interesting issue with many asthmatics is cold air. Although not an allergen per se, cold and dry air can trigger asthma symptoms. This is especially true when you're exercising.Cold, dry air can trigger the bronchioles in your lungs to contract making it difficult to breath.
Rapid and quick inhalation or sudden exposure to cold air can trigger symptoms. When you're exercising, this increases your risk of experiencing symptoms due to the cold air.
It's important to keep warmer air flowing into your lungs until they are warmed up for exercise. When it's cold outside, wear a scarf over your mouth, breathe into your shirt or wear a face mask that covers your mouth. These items help warm the air before your breathe it into your lungs.

, Everyone with asthma has some sort of trigger. This is something that causes you to have symptoms or to have an asthma attack.If exercise causes you to have symptoms of asthma or to have an asthma attack make sure you monitor your overall intensity.
If pollen triggers symptoms of asthma, consider exercising indoors at home or at the gym. Exercising in a high pollen season can more quickly trigger an asthma attack.
Also be mindful if your triggers are animal dander, dust, mold or other household allergens. Doing a workout at home may be triggered by these allergens as well.

Confirm your complaint falls under state law.,
Locate the correct agency to take your complaint.,
Complete the appropriate complaint form.,
Include any necessary supporting documentation.,
File your complaint with the appropriate agency.,
Cooperate with any follow-up interviews or attempts to resolve your complaint.",How to File a Civil Rights Complaint2," Some states have laws that go beyond federal law to protect your civil rights in additional contexts.


State agencies also investigate discrimination complaints, sometimes working alongside federal agencies.In some situations, the state agency will send the complaint along to the federal agency as well, in a procedure known as ""dual filing."" For example, if you file an employment discrimination complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the department also will file your complaint with the EEOC., As with the federal government, state governments include different agencies that have the power to handle certain types of civil rights complaints.


For example, if you live and work in Texas and you have a complaint about discrimination in the workplace that you believe violated your civil rights, you can file a state complaint with the Texas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division.You also can file with the federal EEOC.

, Typically the state agency will have a form available for you to fill out that details the incident in which you claim your civil rights were violated.


If there isn't a specific form, write a letter describing the incident completely, including the date and location of the incident and who was there. Include contact information for yourself, the person you allege violated your civil rights, and any witnesses. Identify the type of discrimination that took place and the reason you believe the events you describe constituted discrimination., If you have any additional documents or the names of witnesses who will back up your claims, you should attach those to your complaint form.


Generally make sure you've included all information that would help a staff member to fully understand what happened and why you're making the complaint., Once you've completed your form, make copies of everything you plan to submit for your records, then submit it to the agency.


As with the federal government, state agencies generally require you to submit your complaint in writing.Some states may have a more expanded process. For example, before you file a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, you must first file a pre-complaint inquiry. The department will contact you within 30 days of receipt of your inquiry and schedule a phone interview. After that interview, the investigator will decide whether to accept your case for a full complaint and investigation., An agency representative will review your complaint and determine the appropriate course of action to resolve your issue.


You may be required to meet with the investigator again. You also may be required to answer written questions submitted by the other side, or to attend a mediation or other attempt to resolve the dispute short of filing a lawsuit."

Heat up your smoker.,
Use tongs to place bratwurst inside the smoker.,
Smoke the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours.,
Check the bratwurst’s internal temperature.,
Remove the bratwurst.",How to Cook Bratwurst7," Smoking meats is a very different process from grilling on a barbecue or cooking on a stove. Smoking involves lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Heat up your smoker to about 200 °F (93 °C). Follow your manufacturer’s instructions to get the smoker ready for use, such as adding water and smoke flavoring.

Some people like to cook bratwurst at a higher temperature, such as 250 °F (121 °C), while others aim for a much lower temperature, starting at 100F for an hour, then raising to 125F and 150F. These lower temperatures will mean it will take you much longer to cook the brats.
Hickory or applewood smoke is a good flavor for smoked bratwurst.

, Line up the bratwurst inside the smoker and be sure to give each wurst a little room. Be careful not to puncture or tear the casings on each brat.

Brats will cook more slowly on the bottom rack than on the top rack., Leave the smoker to cook the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. You don’t need to flip over the bratwurst halfway through. Rather, leave them alone for at least 2 hours. Every time the door to the smoker opens, the smoker loses a little heat and you’ll have to cook a little longer.

Adjust your cooking time if you are smoking at a lower temperature than 200F.

, After about 2 hours, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 °F (71 °C).

It’s best to use the same bratwurst every time to check the temperature. Every time you puncture it with a thermometer, some juices will escape and will make that bratwurst less than perfect.

, Use tongs to take the bratwurst out of the smoker. Set them on a plate. Be sure to use a different plate than the one you may have used to load them in. You want to avoid cross-contamination between raw bratwurst and cooked bratwurst."

Sing an annoying song - constantly.,
Imitate everything she says.,
Stare at her all the time.,
Learn a language she doesn't understand.,
Completely ignore her.,
Make up an annoying nickname for her.,
If you want to get your sister really mad, you should take her diary, where she writes all of her innermost thoughts and secrets.,
Poke her.,
Laugh at everything she says.,
Wear her clothes and pretend you're her.",How to Bug Your Sister2," Choose a really annoying song, like ""La Cucaracha"" or ""The Birdie Song"" and sing it or hum it constantly when your sister is around. Soon it'll drive her crazy!


Alternatively, you could play a really annoying instrument, like the kazoo or a tambourine. Play it loudly when your sister is trying to do her homework or watch her favorite TV show.
When she tells you to knock it off, act really offended and tell her she's interfering with your musical genius.

, This is the oldest trick in the book when it comes to annoying your sister, but it still works like a charm. Whenever your sister says anything, repeat it - it'll infuriate her pretty quickly!


To make it even more annoying, put on a high-pitched, girly voice while you do it, and pretend that you can't pronounce your Rs properly, or that you have a lisp.
If she tries to get clever and say something like ""I'm an annoying little brat"" just so you'll repeat it, outsmart her by changing the ""I'm"" to ""you're"", so you say ""you're an annoying little brat"" instead.

, Try to freak your sister out by staring at her constantly, without speaking. Do it at the breakfast table, while she's watching TV, or when you're in the car. Make your eyes really wide and blink as little as possible.


Try sneaking into your sister's room in the morning, before she wakes up. Lean over her and place your face about on inch away from hers, staring at her. When she wakes up and the first thing she sees is your staring eyes she'll be completely freaked out!
You could also go outside and stand outside her bedroom window. Then when she opens her curtains, you'll just appear in front of her! She'll probably scream!

, Try learning a few phrases (or curse words!) from a language that your sister doesn't understand, and say them to her over and over again. This will drive her crazy, especially if she tends to be a bit of a know-it-all!


You could learn phrases from a real language, such as French or German, or from a made-up language, such as pig latin or gibberish.
You could also just learn some big words in English that you know she won't understand. You don't need to use them in context or anything, just say them as if you know what they mean. Some good ones include malevolent, perfidious and animalistic.

, Sometimes the best way to annoy your sister is not to do anything at all - just pretend she doesn't exist!


Don't ever look at her or acknowledge her presence at all. She may not notice or care at first, but after a while it'll start to drive her crazy!
Whenever she says something to you, don't reply, pretend you didn't hear anything. You could even look around you in a bewildered way and say something like ""who said that?"" or ""did you hear that?""
You can take this even further by pretending she doesn't even exist. When you set the table for dinner leave her place blank. Or when anyone mentions her name, look really confused and ask ""who?""

, Calling your sister by an annoying nickname is one surefire way to get her blood boiling.


Come up with a nickname that rhymes with her real name, like if her name is Hannah or Anna, you could call her ""banana"". Or if her name is Lucy, you could call her ""goosey"".
Or else just come up with something really offensive. For example, you could refer to her as ""The Squid"" or ""dog-face"" or ""Miss Piggy"".

,


When you're done, you can leave the diary somewhere obvious, along with a note that says something like ""I know all your secrets"". In fact, you don't even need to read her diary (nor should you), you just need to make her think you did.
However, if you do decide to read it (which you shouldn't), try to memorize some of the best bits. Then you can recite them back to her when she least expects it. For example, when she's doing her homework you could walk into the room and say ""I wish Ryan would notice me, but he acts like I'm invisible."" in a high-pitched, girly voice. Then you should run for your life!

, Simple, but effective - you can drive your sister crazy just by poking her over and over again. Do it in the car, at the dinner table, while she's watching TV, when she's in bed - basically whenever you can get close to her!


You can either poke her in the stomach, where it tickles or poke her face, where it's just really annoying. You could even make a face while you poke her and say something like ""Ewww, what is that?"" This will make her really paranoid - she'll think she has a huge pimple or something!
Just be warned that sisters tend to poke back - so don't give it if you can't take it!

, Another good way to bug your sister is to laugh at absolutely everything she says, even if she's being completely serious.


This will drive her particularly crazy if she's upset about something, such as a fight with her friend or getting a bad grade at school. Laugh and point, like Nelson from the Simpsons - ""haha!""
Or else you can laugh hysterically when she actually tries to make a joke or be funny. But keep laughing for a really long time, until it's obvious that you're just being sarcastic.

, Sneak into her room and snag some of her clothes. The more she likes those particular items, the better.

Dress like her. Use the same combination of skirt and blouse that she wears. If your feet are the same size or smaller, put on the shoes she'd wear with that dress.
Arrange your hair in a similar way if you can. If not, find a wig somewhere.
Come down to breakfast one morning as her. Mimic her speech patterns, hand movements and stuff like that. It won't take long before she howls for your mom or dad to make you stop!

Wash your bed sheets and choose the right pillowcase.,
Eat well and stay hydrated.,
Protect your skin.",How to Cleanse Pores1," The heat of the water relaxes your skin and opens your pores, which helps gets rid of of excess oil, which may cause blackheads and acne.The water doesn't need to be so hot that it is uncomfortable, just warm enough for cleansing.;
, This doesn't mean to just get some soap and rub it all over your face. Choose an oil-free, water-based skin care product for best results.Some kinds of cleansers may be specifically marketed for facial care; it is up to you to judge whether or not these help you with your complexion.


Over-the-counter acne creams may be desirable, as they contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, which help dry skin oils.But keep in mind that medicated cleansers, as well as facial scrubs, products containing astringents, and body wash, may irritate your face rather than cleanse it. Use what feels right for your body.

, Cleansers, if drying on your skin, may themselves be irritating. You may wish to wash it off with colder water, which can make your skin feel tighter. If you wear makeup, always remove it before going to bed.

, Facial lotions will moisturize your skin, keeping it from producing too much oil. There are many kinds of different skin types, so there are many kinds of different lotions. Choose one that fits your skin type and lifestyle; for example, if you are acne-prone, you may want to try an oil-free gel rather than a heavy lotion. Other lotions contain plant-based oils that may be necessary for skin that tends to be dry., Keeping your bed linens clean is key to maintaining clean pores. If dirt, oil, and bacteria build up on your sheets, then they can transfer to your skin and clog your pores. Additionally, silk pillowcases can help prevent wrinkling, which can minimize the look of your pores., Keep your pores clearer with a diet that features fruits, vegetables, dairy, and lean meats. These foods will provide you with nutrients that can help the overall look of your skin. Choose foods that are low-glycemic and minimally processed to promote healthier skin.To stay hydrated, drink 8-10 glasses of water., Clean pores don't just happen in the shower; they must also be maintained. Choose a daily sunscreen that will protect your skin, and make sure you keep your skin clean (for instance, after exercising) without overwashing."

You can use the free USBWriter utility to turn a USB drive into an Arch Linux installation drive if the computer you are installing on doesn't have a disc drive.

, Installing Arch Linux (or any operating system) will erase all of the data on the hard drive partition it is installed on. If you are only using one partition on your computer, Arch Linux will erase all of the data on it.



Click here for detailed instructions on backing up data.

, Reboot the computer.

, On most newer computers, this is F12, though the exact key should be displayed on the screen during boot up. If there is no key to change boot order, press the BIOS Setup key (usually F1, F2, F10, or Del).

, If you are in the BIOS Setup menu, there is typically a Boot menu that allows you to set the order. You will want to set the drive that contains your Arch Linux installation media as the primary drive.

, If you don't see this option, or your computer boots to your existing operating system, then you likely did not select the correct boot drive.


If you are booting in UEFI Mode, the menu option will read Arch Linux archiso x86_64 UEFI.

, Arch Linux will attempt to establish a connection to the internet during the boot process. You can test to ensure it worked by pinging a website. For example, enter the following to ping Google: ping -c 3 www.google.com.


If you aren't able to establish a connection, ensure that your Ethernet cable is securely connected or you are close enough to your wireless router to get a good signal.

, For simplicity's sake, this guide will explain how to install Arch Linux from a blank disk without booting two operating systems. Type sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda and press ↵ Enter. This will erase all of the data on the hard disk, so make sure anything important is backed up first.


If you want to install Arch Linux as a second operating system alongside Windows, you will need to install Windows first. The above command will delete everything on the disk, including any Windows installation.

, Type efivar -l and press ↵ Enter. If the UEFI entries in the results are filled in, then you are using UEFI mode instead of legacy BIOS. This is important when it comes time to make new partitions.

, The process for both will be explained below.

, This tool will allow you to create GPT partitions for UEFI systems. You will need to create an extra EFI partition as well. In this example, we will be creating a Root partition, a Home partition, and an EFI partition. If you need to create MBR partitions, skip to the next step.


Start cgdisk by typing cgdisk /dev/sda and pressing ↵ Enter.
Select New and then press ↵ Enter to select the first sector. Type the size you want to make the Root partition (e.g. 20G for 20 gigabytes). Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the Root partition.
Press ↓ until the remaining free space is selected. Press ↵ Enter to select the first sector. Type in the the size you want to make the Home partition. Make sure to leave about 500 MB for your EFI partition. Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the Home partition.
Press ↓ until the remaining free space is selected. Press ↵ Enter to select the first sector, and then press ↵ Enter again to select the remaining free space (should be around 500 MB. Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the EFI partition.
Select Write to write the new partitions to the disk. Type yes and choose Quit to exit cgdisk.

, These partitions are required if you are using legacy BIOS boot. In this example, we will be creating a Root partition and a Home partition.


Start fdisk by typing fdisk /dev/sda and pressing ↵ Enter.
Type o and press ↵ Enter to create the partition table.
Create the Root partition:

Type n and press ↵ Enter to create a new partition.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition type.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition number.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the first sector.
Type the amount of space you want to create the partition for (e.g. +20G) and press ↵ Enter



Create the Home partition:

Type n and press ↵ Enter to create a new partition.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition type.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition number.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the first sector.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the amount of space you want to create the partition for. This will create the partition with all the remaining free space.


Type w and press ↵ Enter to write the changes to the disk.

, Creating the partitions only allocates space on the disk. You will need to format this space so that Arch Linux can be installed and access the space. The following commands are for the example above, so if you set up your partitions differently, adjust the commands accordingly.


Type mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 and press ↵ Enter to format the root partition.
Type mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 and press ↵ Enter to format the home partition.
Type mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda3 and press ↵ Enter to format the EFI partition (GPT only).

, Once your partitions are created and formatted, you'll need to mount them so that Arch Linux can point to them. Again, these instructions are based on the example above, so adjust your commands accordingly.


Mount the root partition to /mnt by typing mount /dev/sda1 /mnt and pressing ↵ Enter.
Create the directory for your home partition after mounting root by typing mkdir /mnt/home and pressing ↵ Enter.
Mount the home partition in the new directory by typing mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/home.
Create a directory for the EFI partition (if necessary). Type mkdir /mnt/boot and pres ↵ Enter. Mount the EFI partition to the new directory by typing mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot and pressing ↵ Enter.

, The mirrors are servers that allow you to download packages required to install Arch Linux. it is a good idea to change your primary mirror to the closest physical mirror available.

, Visit archlinux.org/mirrorlist/ on another computer and use the tool to find the closest mirror to your physical location. Copy the address down. It may help to write down a few mirrors in case one is offline.

, You can add additional mirrors underneath in the order you want them to try to connect.

, Type pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel and press ↵ Enter. This will load the essential files onto the root directory. The process may take a few minutes.

, This file allows Arch Linux to identify your partition's file systems. Type genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab and press ↵ Enter.

, Type arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash and press ↵ Enter.

, This file will determine what monetary units and time format to use. Type nano /etc/locale.gen to edit the Locale file.


For US users, remove the # in front of the en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 entry. Users from other countries should remove the # for their specific format.
Type locale-gen to create the file using the settings in the locale.gen file.
Type echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf to set your language as the system-wide language. Replace en_US.UTF-8 with whatever you chose above.
Type export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to finish the location setup.

Start with the Thesis.,
Brainstorm.,
Group related ideas together.,
Begin with Roman numeral I.,
Introductory Paragraph: The Introductory Paragraph should start general and end specific.,
Body paragraphs: Body paragraphs contain the substance of your argument.,
Conclusion: A proper conclusion should provide a sense of closure while also leaving the topic open to further exploration.",How to Create an Outline for an Argumentative Paper," Your thesis is the central argument of the paper. Every following sentence must be written with the intention of supporting this idea.


An effective thesis should attempt to elicit a strong response from the reader. A reader should not finish the introductory paragraph and think, “So what?”
Be prepared to change your thesis as often as possible. As you generate new ideas and make new logical connections, the scope of your paper will likely change and as a result so should your thesis.;
, List anything that you believe is related to the argument, including quotes from primary and secondary sources.

, Take a look at the list of ideas you’ve generated and begin to organize them into groups.


A sound argumentative essay will have a hierarchy of ideas that follows a logical progression. When grouping your ideas, keep in mind how each group relates to the others.

, Each section’s heading should start with a capitalized Roman numeral (I., II., III., etc.) and contain the topic of that paragraph.


Label subheadings with capitalized letters (A, B, C, etc.). Secondary subheadings begin with lowercase numerals (i., ii., iii., etc.) and tertiary subheadings begin with lowercase letters (a., b., c., etc.).

,


The very first sentence can be anything from a question or an observation, as long as it gets the reader’s attention. The following sentences must then narrow the topic down to a very specific point: the thesis.
As you narrow the topic down, you must of course mention the primary text which your paper is concerned with. If necessary, you may also mention a secondary source that you feel is important to your central argument.

,


In a standard 5 paragraph essay, you will have 3 body paragraphs to develop your argument. Each body paragraph must explore a distinct idea that supports your thesis and include evidence from the text and or secondary sources.
For a fully developed argumentative essay, you may include counter-arguments to your thesis and subsequent refutations.

,


Do not simply restate the thesis. Your conclusion should return to the thesis with a deeper understanding as a result of the arguments and evidence of the body paragraphs.

Use hand-me-downs.,
Ask family and friends for old clothes.,
Attend a clothing swap.,
Give new life to an old garment by decorating it.,
Repair clothes with minor imperfections.,
Make your own clothing.",How to Dress a Big Family for Less1," One advantage of a big family is that, odds are, some of the younger children can wear clothes that the older children have outgrown.


Make sure that the clothes you hand down from one child to the next are in good condition and do not have any stains or holes.
Start this process while your kids are still young. Teens and older kids are more likely to balk at the notion of wearing someone else’s clothes instead of getting their own, but if they grew up on the practice, they mind find it more bearable.;
, A friend with a son who is older than your eldest might be willing to give you a few clothes her child has outgrown. Similarly, a sister who shares your clothing size might be willing to give you a few garments she has decided to clear out of her closet.

, A clothing swap is an organized event where parents bring their children's gently used clothing and swap it with others for what they need. Search the Internet or newspapers for clothing swaps in your area, or consider organizing one on your own.

, If your kids are resistant to hand-me-downs, make it their own by decorating it to their tastes. Change the buttons out on a blouse, or decorate a pair of jeans with fabric paint or fun iron-on patches.

, A loose button, fallen hem, or ripped stitch can be repaired with novice sewing abilities. You may be able to cover larger tears and stains with decorative iron-on patches or fabric paint, but be reasonable. Make sure your kids are still at an age where decorative patches are considered “cool” instead of embarrassing.

, If you really feel confident in your sewing abilities, try making clothes for yourself and your family. Patterns and fabrics may come cheaper than clothes themselves. If your sewing abilities are not quite strong enough, try investing in a sewing class to strength your skills and open this option up to you.

Measure the temperature at ground level.,
Measure the dew point at ground level.,
Create a chart.,
Find the altitude where temperature and dew point intersect.",How to Analyze a Cloud4," This can be done with a thermometer. You can also look the temperature up on a computer or smartphone. You will need to know the current ground temperature to estimate temperatures high in the sky., This is the temperature where water droplets begin to form (rain or dew) at a given pressure and humidity. Knowing the dew point at ground level will allow you to estimate the dew point at higher levels. It is easiest to look this up on a computer or smartphone, but you can Measure Dew Point point using some simple tools., Atmospheric temperature and dew point temperature both decrease at a steady rate as you go up. This means that you can predict what they each will be at some distance from the ground using the current temperature and dew point at ground level. Make a chart with three columns. The first will be height, the second will be temperature and the third will be dew point.Fill in the height column starting with “Ground Level” and then each subsequent value will be an increase of 100 meters (330 ft) (100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, etc.).
For the temperature column, the first value is your current temperature (in degrees Celsius) and for each 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude that you increase, subtract one degree (20 degrees C, 19 degrees C, etc.).
The current dew point at ground level will be your first value in the dew point column. The subsequent values are found by subtracting 0.2 °C (32.4 °F) for every 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude (15 degrees C, 14.8 degrees C, 14.6 degrees C, etc.)., When the air temperature and dew point coincide, you will form water droplets. When this happens in the atmosphere, those water droplets form clouds. The clouds you are observing will be at the altitude where your graph’s dew point and temperature values are the same."

Lubricate the ring with soap and slide it onto a ring mandrel.,
Gently tap the ring with a wooden mallet or jeweller’s hammer.,
Remove the ring from the mandrel and try it on.",How to Resize a Ring2," You can use bar soap or dishwashing soap. Make sure the ring is evenly coated before sliding it on the mandrel.A ring mandrel is a graduated metal cone, which is used to size rings. You can easily obtain them from general online retailers.

, Your strikes should be gentle yet firm. Strike at a downward angle; you’re essentially trying to move the ring further down the mandrel. Make sure to turn the ring as you strike, to evenly stretch it.If you have access to it, use a vice to secure the mandrel. This will make this step much easier.
If you only have access to a carpenter’s hammer, you should cover the ring with a soft cloth to prevent damage to the band.

, If it’s still too tight, you can repeat the process, placing the ring on the mandrel and hammering until it fits. Keep in mind this method can only stretch a ring about half a size.If the ring is struck, you can strike upwards with the mallet to dislodge it.

Keep track of your paper.",How to Write a School Newsletter," Before you get too far in planning your newsletter, it can be a good idea to consider the goals you have in mind for it. Thinking about the goals that you want your newsletter to achieve can help you build a successful newsletter. Consider some of these aspects of a newsletter and decide what you want your own newsletter to achieve:Should your newsletter focus on events or policies?
Are you going to create and publish the newsletter on your own?
Do you plan on building a team to publish the newsletter?
How big do you want your newsletter to be?
How many people do you want to reach with your newsletter?
What should the newsletter be called?

, You will need to decide how often you want to publish your newsletter before you begin creating it. Having a publication schedule can help you determine how often you'll need to work on the newsletter and when new issues are due. Decide on a publication schedule before planning the rest of your paper to help make it successful.If your school is either very large or very active, you may want to publish more often or publish larger papers, less frequently.
If you are unsure of how often to publish, you may try publishing monthly to begin with.
You probably won't need to publish any editions over the summer months if your school isn't active during them.

, When planning and creating a school newsletter, it can be helpful to keep your audience in mind. The goal of your newsletter will be to inform and engage your audience. Knowing your audience will allow you to write articles and content that is tailored just for them. You'll likely want to include some sections or content for the students in the community.
Your main readers are likely to be the parents and adults in the community.
Your newsletter should also keep staff informed, describing current events at the school.
You might also want to include content that supports your local community.

, Once you have an idea of what your newsletter will include, it's time to think of how you will deliver it to readers. Having a plan in place for distribution will help you reach as many people as possible after your newsletter has been completed and printed. It can also be helpful to think about the size of the school. How many people do you need to reach? Consider some of these distribution methods when deciding what's best for your newsletter: It's important to remember that not everyone might be able to receive digital newsletters. You will likely want to print out physical copies as well.
Physical copies will either need to be delivered or placed in a public space that allows for people to easily pick up a copy.
Digital copies will likely be the most cost effective option and will allow you to reach a large number of readers.

, Today, most school newspapers are created digitally. Because of this, you will need to download and install some publishing software. There are many different options available when looking for desktop publishing software. Check out some of these examples of desktop publishing software to help get you started:Adobe InDesign, Corel Draw, and QuarkXpress are all professional publishing software.
Scribus is open-source desktop publishing software.
You can make a newsletter using Microsoft Word or OpenOffice
Some people find Google Docs to be a good solution, as it allows many people to collaborate on-line.

, Templates will allow you to quickly create the first edition of your newsletter. A good template will also help you create new editions and give your newsletter a sense of cohesiveness. You can either start with a pre-made template or create one of your own.Most publishing software will include a number of templates for you to choose from.
You can try searching on-line for free school newsletter templates.
Templates allow you to easily add your own information or update old information.
A good template will have spaces for both your articles and photos to go with them.
You might want to make templates for specific months. For example, you might have a template for February that has a heart theme because of Valentine's day.
For text areas, it's a good idea to have predefined spaces for your title, headings, and the main body of text.

, Once you've built or found a template, you will want to customize it. Customizing a template will let you add elements that you want to continue across all editions of your school newsletter. Take a look at this list to discover some of the things you might want to add to your template:Place the school name at the top of the front page.
Add in a footer with page number, date, edition, or other information you might want to include.
Putting your school logo somewhere on the front page can be a good idea.
Include clip-art to give your newsletter an appealing and interesting look.
You might want to have dedicated pages for certain content. For example, you could put contact information for school staff on the last page of your newsletter.
You'll likely want to decide the basic layout for articles and pages. A simple two column layout can be a good way to start.

, After you've created and customized a newsletter template, you can begin to create content for it. The content you create should strive to meet the goals of your newsletter and be appealing to your audience. To help get you started, try reading over these examples of what a school newsletter might contain:A calendar of the year and upcoming events.
Current news.
Upcoming activities or programs.
Birthdays.
Community news.
Changes in school policy.

, It can be a good idea to add in fun things to your newsletter, such as puzzles or games. However, the majority of your newsletter should be informative content. If a piece doesn't seem to convey any information to the reader, you may want to consider rewriting it or removing it. Always try to deliver the most information possible to your readers when publishing your school newsletter.An opinion piece on the quality of cafeteria food might be nice. However, it's probably a better idea to include a lunch schedule instead.
Detailing the repair process of a restroom might be too much information. It might be better to focus on things like how long the renovation took or how much it cost.
Updates on school policies should always be included.
You might want to highlight student achievements in your newsletter.
It can be a good idea to have small articles that introduce new staff members.

, You don't have to create an entire school newsletter yourself. Involving others can be a lot of fun for everyone. With more people working on the newsletter, both the content and the quality can be improved. Try asking students, staff or others to help create content or design the layout of your school newsletter.Asking students to write articles can be a good way to let them express a student's viewpoint and get in some writing practice.
Having staff write articles can result in more detailed or informative pieces. For example, asking a math teacher to write about the new high-level math course would be a good idea.
You might have students form a club around creating and publishing the newsletter.
Asking for help with printing, publishing, or distributing might be necessary. You can check with local school staff, send a request for volunteers, or check with local businesses.

, If you are offering printed copies of your newsletter, you will want to make them easy to find. Placing them in an area that doesn't see much traffic will likely result in less people reading the newsletter. Sending them home in certain ways can work better than others. Always make sure that your newsletter is easy to locate or is likely to be delivered successfully.


You'll likely want to create a list of people who want to subscribe to your newsletter.
Try leaving it near the entrances to your school or local businesses.
Bring some copies to your nearby library to put out for people to take.
Leaving some copies on the front desk of the main office can be a good idea.
If you have the budget, your school may mail printed copies to the community.
Give the paper to students to take home. Some have found that giving the newsletter to younger children increases the chances of it getting home., Digital publication can lower costs and increase the size of your reader base. There are many methods that you can use to easily send your newsletter digitally to your readers. Try using some of these methods to send your newsletter out digitally:You can use group emails to send out your newsletter.
You might post new editions on your school's homepage.
Use your school's social media accounts to let people know about new editions of your paper.
You could build a dedicated website or blog to post new editions of your newsletter.

, It can be a good idea to record and track some information about your newspaper. Collecting this data will tell you how many people are reading it, how many copies are actually being used, or even what information people prefer to read about. This information can help you create a better paper and will allow you to meet the needs of your readers.


Keep track of how many paper copies are taken by readers. This can tell you if you need to print more or less copies in the future.
Counting how many copies are taken from different locations will tell you where the best places are to distribute the paper.
For digital versions, you can track how many people download the paper and from where. This can help you learn if people are finding the paper on your school's homepage or from social media.
You might include reader surveys that would allow for constructive feedback.

Return the quail to its cage.",How to Catch Quail2," Bring everything you will need to catch the quail. You will probably need:


A helper.
A small box with breathing holes.
A blanket or towel.
A long stick.

, Quails may be quite fast and camouflaged, but your dog or cat will eventually find them and possibly injure or kill them.


Don’t lock the pets in a room where you plan to lead the quail to, such as a shed or barn.

, There are many mistakes that quail-owners make and don’t realize that it’s not a good idea. Some tips on what you shouldn’t do are:


Don’t wait until the last minute to catch your quail. Most people take so long thinking of what they should do or waiting until someone arrives to help them that by the time they realize what to do or get help the quail is gone! Another mistake is people waiting until it is nighttime to catch the quail, thinking that the quail is sleepy and more tired. By then it would be a lot harder to find the quail as it is dark and the quail probably isn’t in the area anymore.
Don’t leave your quail. Even for just one minute, quail do travel and ‘’’blend’’’ into plants, grass and trees.
Don’t chase your quail. Even though you think you are going to catch up with the quail, quickly grab it and everything will be fine, the quail is a lot faster and smaller than you. Quails can also fly straight up into a more difficult position when frightened.

, In order to catch the quail you will need to know where it is. Search in bushes, along fences, under logs and above in the trees or on the roof. Remember, quails can fly a short distance so you may want to ask a neighbour to check their yard.


Try not to leave the quail out of your sight. You will most likely lose it and have to search all over the yard again, you might even lose it for good this time.
Poke a long stick along bushes, shrubs, grass and other hiding places. It might scare the quail into coming out or at least spook the quail so that you know where it is.

, The best place to corner the quail is indoors such as a shed, barn or your own home. That way the quail will find it hard to get away from you.


Do not corner the quail into any bushes, under large objects or outside your backyard, you will find it very hard to catch the quail.
Approach the quail slowly and quietly. Quails get frightened easily and will fly straight up if you scare them.

, You probably know by now that quails fly when frightened, that’s why placing a blanket over the quail is a good idea. The blanket will stop the quail from flying or escaping, it also makes the quail easy to hold.

, Cup both of your hands on the quail and remember to be gentle and not squeeze the quail tightly. Quails are very small and fragile.

, The box doesn’t have to be big if you are going to put the quail in its cage straight away, it does have to have breathing holes though.

, Do this straight away, keeping the quail in a small box can stress it out and make the quail unhappy. Make sure that the cage has no gaps and is closed securely to prevent the quail from escaping again.

, Bird nets can be purchased from most pet shops and will make the job of catching your quail a lot easier. If you cannot find a bird net anything alike will do as long as it is bigger than the quail.

, There’s more than catching a quail with just one simple bird net. You will probably need a helper and a small box with breathing holes.

, Quail don’t really travel far, especially if they are travelling away from their home, so you will probably find them eventually as long as you have patience and dedication. Good places to look are:


Around the quails housing. Most quail don’t like the ‘free life’ and will eventually try to get back in the cage or at least hang around the cage.
In bushes, shrubs or trees. You should get dirty and search through, under and above the bush. If your quail flies it might land in the bush and possibly get stuck.
Along fences/walls. Most quail will try to hide and get out of the open because they have many bird predators, so if you have no bushes, trees or hiding places for your quail, they might be along your fence/wall.
On the roofs of sheds, houses or garages. Once again, quail fly really high when frightened, so they might be on the roof of something.
In a neighbours garden (with permission). When quail fly, they can travel quite a distance so by now they might be in one of your neighbour’s garden.

, The worst thing you can do is run, shout, get angry and make sudden movements as this will scare the quail and cause it to fly to a more difficult spot.

, Do not lift the net off but keep it firmly down on the ground. Never move the net or slide it on the ground, this might injure your quail as they are small, fragile birds.

, Keep holding the quail firmly whilst lifting the net off the ground, then grab the quail from the inside of the net.


Never lift the net and quickly grab hold of your quail from the inside, they are fast birds that can easily escape if you do this. The best way to grab hold of the quail is from the outside of the net.

, The box doesn't have to be very big if you are going to put the quail straight into its home.

, It should be secure, safe and there should be no gaps or any sort of escape route for the quail.

, It’s best to do this straight after catching the quail otherwise the quail might get stressed out and be very unhappy.

, You can’t just leave the quail out of your sight, not even for one minute as they are fast birds that can get lost easily. You will probably need:


A helper.
A small box with breathing holes.
A long stick or something alike.

, This is where you will chase your quail into. If your quail is indoors, it makes them easier to catch as they cannot hide in shrubs, fly away and you cannot lose them.


The room doesn't have to be a shed, it can be anything (E.G. a garage, barn or even your own home) as long as it doesn't have a step to get indoors as quail will not go indoors if there is a step.

, In order to catch the quail you must first find it. Look in bushes, long patches of grass, along fences and in the trees.

, Spread your arms out and slowly lead the quail to the shed one step at the time.


Try using a long stick to lead the quail. The stick will reach a further distance than your arms and it will make it easier to control your quail.
It won’t help if you are rushing the quail as it will probably fly away instead of going to the shed.

, If you don’t, it makes it easier for your quail to escape as there is a clear exit.

, Cup your hands on the quails body and put the quail inside a box with breathing holes. Hold the quail firmly but don’t ‘’’squeeze’’’ the quail, you may injure it.


If your quail goes under/behind a large objects such as washing machines, old furniture, lawn mowers, etc, try using your stick to get it out.

, You don’t want to keep your quail in a small box as it can stress the quail out. The best thing you can do for the quail now is to return it to its safe and happy home.


Make sure the cage is escape proof before you put your quail back in it. The last thing you want to do is catch your quail and then lose it all over again.

Apply raw honey to the pimple.,
Use ice to reduce the swelling and redness.,
Try cucumber.,
Apply witch hazel or apple cider vinegar.,
Use lemon juice on the pimple.,
Try applying aloe vera.",How to Get Rid of Pimple Redness Overnight1," Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a good natural product for reducing redness on your skin. Look for honey that is all natural and raw.Dip a cotton ball or a Q-tip into the honey and dab it onto the pimple. Leave the honey on for about 15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. Do not scrub or rub at the pimple when you rinse off the honey. You can apply the honey as needed.You can also try making a paste with cinnamon or turmeric powder and the honey. You can then use a Q-tip to apply the paste to the pimple. Cinnamon and turmeric have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Keep in mind turmeric can tinge your skin an orange color so you may want to try the paste on the inside of your wrist or behind your ear before you use it on your face.;
, You can also try using ice on the pimple to make the swelling and redness go down, similar to how you might ice a swollen muscle. You will need ice and a clean cotton towel for this method.Wrap the ice cube in the towel and apply it to your pimple for 20 minutes at a time. Allow for 20 minutes between applications, applying the ice as needed.

, Cucumbers are great natural coolants for the skin and they contain astringent properties that can help to reduce swelling and redness. Make sure you use a cold cucumber for this method. Place it in your refrigerator so it is cold enough.You can place a thin slice of cucumber, peeled or unpeeled, directly on the pimple. Leave the cucumber on for five minutes or until warm, then replace with a new, cold slice. Repeat as needed.

, Both witch hazel and apple cider vinegar have astringent properties, which can reduce the swelling and redness. You can find both of these products at your local health food store or in the natural beauty aisle.Apply witch hazel or apple cider vinegar with a Q-tip to the pimple and let it dry. You can apply the witch hazel or apple cider vinegar as needed throughout the day or overnight.
Stop applications of apple cider vinegar if skin becomes irritated after application.

, Lemon juice is a good natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Try to use fresh lemon juice for this method.Put one to two drops of lemon juice on a Q-tip and dab it on the pimple. Keep it on for five minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat this method three to four times a day with a fresh Q-tip.
Lemon juice is slightly acidic so it may sting a little when you apply it to the pimple. It also has bleaching qualities so make sure you do not go out in the sun right after you have used the lemon juice. The bleaching effect could make the pimple lighter, leading to a spot on your skin that is lighter than your skin tone.

, Aloe vera is an herb that has been traditionally used to promote healing and to soothe inflamed or irritated skin. It also has astringent properties, so it will tighten the skin as it dries. You can get aloe vera gel by breaking off an aloe vera leaf and squeezing out the gel. You can also find packaged aloe vera at your local health food store or online.Dip a clean Q-tip into the aloe vera gel. Then, apply it directly to the pimple and let it dry. Rinse the area off with warm water. Repeat applications of 100% aloe twice daily.
If you are using an aloe vera leaf, you can store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. Use the leaf until all the gel inside is gone.
Do not ingest aloe. Oral intake has been linked with diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney dysfunction.

Maintenance.",How to Look Like Cameron Diaz," If you smoke, stop. Now. IMMEDIATELY. Cameron quit smoking in a bid to help her acne. If she can do it, so can you. Get into the cleanse-tone-moisturize routine. It sounds cheesy, but your mother always did know best... Use products that match your skin type; i.e. dry - cream cleanser/non-drying toner/rich SPF moisturizer. Combination/Oily - foaming cleanser/toner/light oil-free moisturizer with SPF for day and slightly richer at night. Spotty skin is often sensitive, so natural products are best. Pore strips are a God-send if you have a blackhead-ridden nose. Zinc tablets are rumoured to be helpful with acne.;
, Moisturize beforehand with a moisturizer that matches your skin type. Get a foundation that matches your skin tone, preferably two different shades (before and after tanning). Next, use foundation just enough to even out your skin tone. Blend a creamy concealer into any blemishes or under-eye dark circles. Apply loose powder with a large powder brush, or pressed powder with a sponge for the most matte coverage. Sweep a naturally rosy pink blush into the apple of your cheeks. For a day look, wear neutral colours on both eyes and lips. Use a a shimmery gold/brown eyeshadow, lots of jet-black mascara and a barely-there brown pencil eyeliner, with rosy pink natural lip gloss and lip liner (if you wear liner). For a little more glamorous night look; red lips can be used with the neutral eyes described above, or grey/black smokey eyes and the natural lips.

, Wear low rise, floor-skimming jeans all the time. Her denim is usually more washed-out for daytime looks and darker for evening looks. Own many casual tops/tees. Vertical stripes, head-to-toe colour and long dark jeans make you look taller, a prerequisite for looking like 5'9"" Miss Diaz. Cameron is all about t-shirts and tanks. Incorporate some surfer into your style.

, Cameron loves hats, and usually wears them perfectly with casual outfits. She includes fedoras, berets and baseball caps (among others). Her jewelry is usually simple and minimal. She may wear one necklace or earrings with a splash of color, often turquoise or green which suit her colouring. Again, be a little edgy/surfer with your style.

, Do wear shoes with a rise or heel of around 2 inches (5.1 cm). Platform, wedge and square heel styles are the most practical for regular use. Sling backs, pointed and low-cut toe-cleavage shoes are elongating to the foot and leg, so you look taller.

, Cameron has a round face, so hopefully you do too! If not, her cut is quite adaptable, but take a picture to a salon and talk to your hairdresser beforehand. Get side bangs, layers and create a deep side part and sweep your bangs heavy to the other side. Change your hair color from highlighted blonde to brown if you want. For a casual look start with wavy dry hair, then pull your hair loosely back and twist it into a loose/messy bun. Secure into place with Kirby grips and spritz with hairspray to finish. For a more put-together finish, use straight hair, leave your bangs out and direct the rest of your hair into a ponytail. Wrap your hair around the elastic band at the base of the ponytail, tuck in the ends and pin into place. Alternatively, you could put the bangs into a quiff. Also for a curly look, use mousse to give volume and blow-dry upside-down, finishing by using straighteners/tongs to curl the hair from the top of the ear down. Don't forget to use heat protection and a weekly intensive hair mask.

, Be bubbly and sexy. Don't worry that you don't have the biggest boobs or the most on-trend fashion (Cameron is B-cup and dresses to her shape rather than the catwalk). Be confident and nice. Smile all the time. Be really happy. Keep your thoughts reasonable and think positively. Lighten up. Don't take yourself too seriously. Try not to over-analyze things. Stress can cause many mental, physical, and spiritual problems in your life. One of the major causes of stress is worrying about things that are out of your control. Learn to recognize these things and if you can truly do nothing about them, then just let them go. Take time to laugh at yourself and the situations you find yourself in. Laughter is a powerful, positive medicine and the calmer and more peaceful you can take things, the happier your life will be.

, Get some inspiration on how Cameron walks, talks, acts, looks and dresses from the films she has starred in. She first found fame in The Mask; and has since starred in films like The Sweetest Thing, Charlie's Angels, There's Something About Mary and In Her Shoes. She is also the voice of the fabulous Princess Fiona from the Shrek trilogy. Do some movie research!

, Get clean. Bathe/shower once a day. Feeling and looking clean is important. Wash with a scented body gel (soap is drying) and a loofah/bath scrubber and it will smell great. Get out and pat yourself dry with a towel, rub in some rich body lotion and use deodorant/antiperspirant. You need to be soft and cuddly at all times (do not neglect your knees and elbows). If possible, try to layer matching scents on your body; such as citrus shower gel, citrus body lotion, citrus deodorant, and citrus perfume. Musky or floral scents are also delicious.

, Create a work-out plan. Lunges/crunches/squats/weights etc twice a week and cardio three times a week. Cameron is well-known for her lean and toned body shape. Crunches equal flat, hard ab muscles, lunges equal toned legs, and squats a toned backside. Running or jogging works for cardio and utilizes all the muscles of the body and increases your stamina, but get some decent trainers if you run on tarmac. Cameron is famed for her surfing, which she learned for the film 'Charlie's Angels'. She also enjoys hiking and snow-boarding, which are great for all-round toning. Go on her trainer's (Teddy Bass) website for help.

, Get a gorgeous, glowing tan. Use FAKE TAN lotion only, not a sunbed. Definitely wear bronzer and always wear sun-screen every day. Exfoliate and moisturize thoroughly a couple of hours before a spray tan or home tanning.

, Keep neatly groomed and shaped eyebrows. Have a perfect arch. Get them waxed/shaped professionally. The skinnier the better, but not so skinny that you only have 6 hairs left. NATURAL skinny, not hugely chubby/non-existent brows. If you keep them well groomed (tweezing every fortnight) it will make your eyes pop and make you look more youthful (not baby-style, but pretty). Lightly fill in any uneven patches with a matching brow pencil.

, Weekly; use a clarifying shampoo, an intensive hair mask, exfoliating body scrub and a face mask (to match your skin type). Also weekly, have a bath and give yourself a pedicure & manicure. Polish colours that are popular with Miss Diaz include chocolate brown, fire-engine red and au natural clear. Regularly have your hair cut and coloured/re-highlighted (about every 6 weeks).

Choose your boat.,
Get in the water.,
Work with a partner.,
Use a sounder.",How to Catch Prawns2," Make sure your boat has enough space for a cooler to store freshly caught prawns. A row boat without a motor works best, as it won’t create noise and scare the prawns away. If you do use a boat with a motor, turn the motor off as you approach the prawns’ habitat.

, After you steer the boat to your desired location, put on your wading boots and climb overboard. When you wade, you can walk through shallow waters where prawns are plentiful and follow them as they move. Return to the boat to store your prawns in a cooler to keep them fresh.

, Fishing for prawns will be easier if you work as a team with one or two other fishers. One of you can be responsible for the net while the other steers the boat or aims the flashlight.

, A sounder is a sonar device that can help you find fish. To tell prawns apart from fish, look for a mass of objects coming from the bottom of the water. It should look like a cloud.You can buy high-tech sounders at marine and fishing supply stores for under $100.

Wear deodorant every day, and put some in your gym bag. Also wear perfume or body spray. Shower every day and wash your hair every 2 days. You may also be starting menstruation at this time, so be sure that you pack supplies in every bag, no matter what time of the month it is, in case you get a surprise. Also, even if you don't have your period yet, bring some supplies. You can never be too prepared.;
, You may be cranky a little more often. A good night's sleep can help ease that, and little sleep can actually just add on to your bad mood.

, It is important that you watch what you eat. You should eat vegetables, fruits, grains, as well as protein, but don't be afraid to treat yourself to something sweet every once in a while! Don't go on one of those diets where you starve yourself. If you really want a sweet but healthy dessert, then try putting sugar on some strawberries. It's delicious, and your body is getting fruit and sugar that it can use for energy.

, There's no such thing as being ""too cool for school"". It is very important that you pass your classes. If you really hate school, then look at it like this; don't spend 3 years in 7th grade when you could be done with school quicker.

, You may have mood swings, but you can try and somewhat control them. Try not to blow up over little things. A good way to be kind is helping others. The teenage years are also a good time to start volunteering.

, Let your family and friends in. Don't be secretive. When you're open with your parents, you tend to get more freedom. With your friends, not being secretive will show that they can trust you and they will think of you as a better friend.

, Caffeine makes you hyper and jittery, which is a false sensation of energy, but it's bad for your body and will most likely only make you more tired. A little caffeine every now and then is okay, but don't overdo it.

, Say please, thank you, you're welcome, and may I. Listen to directions and if your parents say no, then that's it. Don't pretend to go to a friend's house but really go to the party they said you couldn't go to.

, Keep your bedroom and living space clean and organized. It builds stress when you're digging around trying to find things.

, Drama is common in the teenage years. Sometimes, it may be unavoidable, but try your best not to associate with those who tend to create drama.

, Sit down with a parent and discuss a good curfew, bedtime, and waking time, as well as what a good age for you to begin dating is.

, If you feel like someone or something is sketchy, it's always better to stay away from it. Alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes are the farthest things from cool, and being addicted can get you in major trouble, not just with your parents, but potentially the law. This doesn't apply to just teenagers, it is good for adults to follow this rule too.

, Have a day with your friends to go to the movies, the beach, the mall, the park, or anywhere you would like to go! Just have fun. Your teenage years may be hard, but they don't last forever, and they are some of your best years.

Stretch throughout the day.",How to Prevent Swelling in Hot Weather3," If your legs are swollen, you can lay on your back with your legs propped up above your head. This will help reduce the swelling. If the swelling is consistently bad, try sleeping like this., Don’t cause yourself pain, but massage the area where you notice swelling. Rub the muscles firmly to reduce fluid build-up in your muscles., If you find yourself sitting or standing in one position for a long time, take a moment to stretch.

, Slide the knot down the straw to where the tick is attached to the horse’s skin. Position the knot around the tick’s head and/or neck, i.e., below its body.

, Once you have the string around the tick’s head, slowly tighten the knot around the head.


Make sure the knot is around the tick’s head and not its body.

Poses like tree pose and half lotus are particularly helpful for healing the root chakra.You can continue to visualize the color red during yoga and dance. This may help with the healing process.

, Being outdoors can help heal any chakra, but especially the root chakra. As the root chakra is found at the bottom of your body, being mindful of your steps can help. Focus on the feeling you get when your feet lift and hit the ground.

Professional energy healers can help you identify which chakras need work and form a plan to get your chakras healed.Keep in mind, however, that healing your chakras may not solve issues like depression and anxiety or physical problems like lethargy. There is very limited medical research and no thorough medical evidence to back up the idea of chakras. If you suffer from mental or physical difficulties, see a medical professional for proper evaluation.

Keep the binder in your kitchen, or give it away as a gift.",How to Make a Recipe Binder," You can buy a plain one that is all one color. You can also buy a fancy one with a pattern on the cover.


You can also use a 2-ring binder if you can't find a 3-ring binder.;
, Paper stains easily in the kitchen. A plastic page protector will keep your recipes clean. The smooth surface is also easy to wipe clean. They are transparent plastic sleeves, about same size as a sheet of printer paper. Most will already have holes punched in the sides for the binder rings to go through. You can find them at office supply stores, and well-stocked arts and crafts stores., You might already have some in your home. You can also find plenty of recipes online and in magazines. Lastly, you can also ask your friends and family members if they have any recipes they would like to share with you.

, This will keep everything looking consistent. If you have beautiful handwriting, you can write the recipes out by hand instead. You can also use the original recipes if you don't care about consistency.

Avoid adding page numbers if you plan on adding more recipes to the binder later.
Use page numbers if you already have all the recipes you want and don't plan on adding anymore.
If the recipe is a long one, print it out on a single page. If you have a few recipes that are short and very similar, try putting them on the same page. You can divide them into paragraphs or columns., If you cannot find any page protectors, try to order some online. You can also get the pages laminated at a photocopying shop. Once they are laminated, punch holes in them using a hole puncher., Having sections will make your recipe binder less overwhelming. They will also make your binder more organized and easier to browse. Here are some ideas for the different sections you could have in your binder:


Appetizers
Baked goods
Desserts
Drinks
Entrees
Favorites
Salads
Soups
Treats

, You can design the title page using an image or word processing program. You can also design it right onto a sheet of paper. The title page should include the name of the section in large letters. You can also include a border and a table of contents that lists all the recipes in that section., Again, if you don't have any page protectors, try to get the pages laminated. Be sure to punch holes in the sides., The tabs should match the section title pages. For example, if you have a section title page for desserts, write ""Desserts"" on the tab., Stagger the tabs when you stick them down onto the pages. Each tab should be positioned a little bit lower than the previous tab. That way, you will be able to see all the tabs at once when you open the binder and look down at it., You can put them in any order you want, but make sure that they are under the right sections.

, Recipe binders make great gifts, especially if they are filled with treasured family recipes that have been passed down for generations. They can also make an ideal going-away-to-college gift.

, You can arrange your binder however you think would be the most helpful for you. This section will give you a few ideas on how to do this. You don't have to use all the ideas from this section., If you have a lot of recipes, you could divide them up further between several binders. For example, you can have a binder for baked goods and another one for salads. You could even have a special one just for family recipes., This means that if you have a section for pies, you might arrange your recipes like this: apple pie, blueberry pie, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, rhubarb pie, etc., This can help make your binder look more orderly. It can also help you find recipes quicker. Here are some ideas for you:

Alphabetize the sections. For example: appetizers, beverages, cakes and cookies, desserts, pasta, poultry, salads, etc.
Arrange the sections in the order you might eat a meal. For example: breakfast, lunch, appetizers, salad, main course, dessert, etc.

, This will make finding recipes a lot easier.


Start by writing down the name of your recipe book in the top center of the page. Use a large, fancy font.
Next, write down the names of the sections in a slightly smaller font. You can still use a fancy font. The section names should be on the left side of the page.
Lastly, write down the names of the recipes in a smaller, but plain, font. Make sure that the recipes are under the right section. The recipes should also be on the left.
If your binder has page numbers, write them down on the right side. The font should be the same as the one you used for the recipe names.

, If you think you might want to keep adding to your binder, it might be a good idea to include two or three extra pages at the end of each section. This way, if you come across a recipe you like, all you have to do it print it out or write it down. If you are using stationary paper, you won't have to worry about trying to find the same design again., These sections aren't based off of any regular food group, such as soups, salads, cakes, and so forth. They are unique and include dishes from multiple food groups. Here are some examples:

Include some categories inspired by foods from different countries, such as: Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, etc.Add a section for your favorite recipes.
Put all of the recipes you are interested in trying out in their own section.
Have a special section for holiday recipes. This will make finding all of those recipes for Thanksgiving a lot easier., Sometimes, you run out of a certain ingredient and don't have the time to run to the store. Research some common substitutions, and print them out onto a sheet of paper. Add this to the back of your binder.Some common cooking substitutions include margarine for butter and white vinegar for lemon juice.

You can also include a section for healthy substitutions, such as wheat flour for white flour, or apple sauce instead of oil/butter., This will come in handy if you are living in the UK and are working with a US recipe, and vice versa. It will also come in handy when you need to measure out liters using cups instead., You can also just use an empty page protector. This is great for those recipes you are not sure about and don't want to put the effort into printing them out just yet., You can tape it to the back of your binder. You can also keep it in its own page protector. This will allow you to keep track of what recipes you have tried and didn't like, so you can avoid using them in the future., You can leave your binder as is, or you can add some special touches to it. This section will give you some ideas. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this section, however. Use the ones you like the most., Stationary paper usually has a pretty boarder. This can make your recipes more interesting to look at.

Stationary paper also tends to come in different themes. Choose a theme you like. You can also match the theme to your binder.
If you have a special section for holiday recipes, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, try matching the paper to the holiday. For example, use paper that has pumpkins or autumn leaves for Thanksgiving recipes, and paper that has snowflakes or Christmas trees for Christmas recipes.

, You can add step-by-step pictures to your recipes. You could also add a picture of the final dish instead. This will make the recipes more colorful. The photos will also give you an idea of what the final dish is supposed to look like in the end., You can make a plain binder more interesting by decorating a sheet of paper, and slipping it behind the clear, protective cover. Here are some ideas to get you started:

If you just want a fancy cover, use a sheet of scrapbook paper. You may have to trim it down a little in order to get it to fit.
Give your binder a title. Write the title down on some paper and slip it behind the protective sheet on the cover. You call it anything you want, such as: You Name's Cookbook.
Use an opaque fabric marker to draw designs on a fabric-covered binder. Most fabric markers come in opaque and transparent colors. Don't use a transparent fabric marker. The colors will blend right into the fabric and won't show up well.
If your binder already has a pattern on it, you could use letter stickers to give it a title.

, This can be a nice way to introduce each section. Here are some ideas""

If you have a salad section, add a picture of your favorite salad onto the title page.
If you have a section for desserts or pastries, add a picture of a fancy cake or pie.
If you have all of the recipes you want in that section, consider adding a mini table of contents. Right beneath the title, write down the names of all the recipes that are in that section. This will help remind you of what is in there.

, This will allow you to get a bit more creative, and match the design of the tab to the rest of your binder. Here's how to make one:

Cut some colored paper into a ½ by 1 inch (1.27 by 2.54 centimeter) rectangle.
Label the tab.
Cut some clear packaging tape into a 1½ by 1½ inch (3.81 centimeter) square
Place the ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) of the tape onto the side of the page protector.
Place the tab under the tape. The long side of the rectangle should flush with the edge of the page protector. It should also be centered on the tape.
Fold the tape over and press it down onto the back of the page protector.

, Using just a few items, you can make your own rustic recipe binder. Here's what you will need:2 sheets thin cardboard or illustration board
Printer paper
2 – 3 binder rings
Markers or letter stickers

, Make sure that they are the same size. These will be the front and back cover of your binder., The paper you are using should be a little bit smaller than the covers., You will need two to three holes. The top and bottom hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top and bottom of the covers., Place the back cover down on a table in front of you, then stack the recipe pages on top of it. Place the front cover on top. Align the holes as best you can., Close the binder rings once all the pages, including the covers, are on them. You can buy binder rings from an office supply store or an arts and crafts store., Write a title using marker or letter stickers. You can also draw on a border using markers or glitter paint., Because the binder is made from paper, you will have to take extra care of it. If you are worried about it getting dirty, consider keeping it in a box or in a cupboard."

Track the length of your illness.,
Pay attention to the color of your mucus.,
Observe your throat.,
Evaluate your fever.",How to Tell a Viral from a Bacterial Infection1," In general, viral infections are milder than bacterial infections, but they tend to last longer. You will feel very sick for 1 to 3 days and then you will start to feel better, but some of your symptoms may linger. Symptoms that linger for a week or more may be a virus.It's important to stay vigilant and talk to your doctor about antibiotics if symptoms last for a while.
Viruses can morph into things like sinus infections or increase the risk of middle ear infections, which may result in you developing a bacterial infection as well.;
, When you blow your nose or cough up mucus, pay attention to the color. While it may feel a little gross, color can be an indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection.Thin and clear mucus is more likely to be a viral infection. Dark, greenish mucus is more likely to be a bacterial infection.
However, mucus color is not a 100% accurate indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection. Make sure to weigh in other factors.

, A sore throat is common for both viral and bacterial infections. Checking for a sore throat is the most common test that will be performed in your doctor’s office to determine if you need antibiotics right away. Certain types of sore throats can indicate a bacterial infection.For example, white spots are generally caused by bacteria. A sore throat without other symptoms, such as a runny nose or sneezing, may be a bacterial infection such as strep throat.

, Fevers can be present in both viral and bacterial infections. However, fevers differ slightly with different types of infections. In bacterial infections, fevers tend to be higher. With a bacterial infection, fevers get worse after a few days while they tend to improve a few days in with a viral infection.The normal human body temperature runs between 97.8° F (36.5°C) and 99°F (37.2°C)."

You will get an initial check from your insurance company to handle immediate needs for food and clothing.,
It is critical that you understand your insurance company’s policy for temporary living expenses.,
You are free to use your own realtors or set of contacts to locate suitable housing.,
Recognize at the onset that all expenses will be borne by you without regard to a timely repayment of those expenses unless you mandate that the insurance company purchase the higher priced goods directly or pay you in advance.,
Transfer whatever contents you can to use in your temporary conditions such as kitchen cookware, dishes, utensils and the like.,
Make sure you understand how the fire is reported.",How to Protect Yourself After a House Fire3," Everything must be documented by a receipt starting at the onset. Keep envelopes for receipts in each category of expense – housing, temporary living expenses, contents replacement, and reconstruction. As you submit receipts, keep a typed copy of each submittal and a copy of the receipts for your own files. Keep a notebook of the categories separated by tabs that holds the paperwork for the submittal –receipts and listing. Provide submissions in accordance with your needs for reimbursement – this may vary by month or frequency of outlays. Initially, a monthly expense statement may be submitted. Once temporary living expenses settle down, then the submittals may become more infrequent and be based on dollar volume. You are eligible to receive some portion of your contents allowance. Some companies provide this upfront; others make you wait six months for it.

, Does your company offer a flat allowance/limit for all expenses or an unlimited allowance for two years? Your expenses will be deducted for the normal living expenses that you would incur without a fire, such as typical food expenses for both eating at home and eating out, and utility expenses. The utility companies (electric, oil, gas) can provide you with the last 12 months of invoices for your home that can create an average expense.

, This is the whole waiting game of the insurance industry and its Achilles heel. If the insurance company wants to have the necessary appliances repurchased by you, then submit to them the bill and state that they can directly pay for it or provide you the check in advance. This same argument may be made for all types of things including pre-purchase of utility rates/contracts, hotel expenses and major temporary living expenses, and larger repurchases relative to items needed to replace or reconstruct your home/contents. Unless you have an extra $50,000 to $100,000 in liquid assets that does not require your usage for a year or two, this will be necessary.

, For any repurchases such as electrical appliances (hairdryers, coffee pots, etc.) remember to buy the quality that you will need when you are placed back into the house. There is not an allowance for any temporary appliances.

, Get a copy of your local fire report. Ask your agent how it is “marked” on the file. This may affect your ability to be covered in the future.

Get a sense of the context of the production.,
Look at the play’s program.,

Create a strong hook or line to open the review.,
Answer who, what, where, and when in paragraph 1.,
Discuss the plot in paragraph 2.,
Talk about the acting and directing in paragraph 3.,
Analyze the design elements of the play in paragraph 4.,
React to the play as a whole in paragraph 5.",How to Write a Play Review," A play review is a subjective and educated response to a piece of theater. The reviewer should have a strong background in theatre so their opinion is informed and credible. Though this is not a requirement for writing a good play review.The review should also give potential audience members a sense of the play. It should let readers know if spending their hard-earned money on a ticket to the production will be money well spent.
Noting that you thought the play was “good” or “bad” will not create a strong play review. Instead, you should be specific in your critique and have a thoughtful analysis of the production. Your opinion on the play should be supported by a discussion of the production elements and how they worked together as a whole.
The review should also describe the situation or plot of the play without giving too information to the reader. Avoid spoiling any plot twists or turns for potential audience members in your review.

, The standard play review contains five paragraphs. There are other approaches you can use, such as comparing two plays in one review or writing longer reviews for one play. But traditionally, a play review will analyze several elements of the production in five paragraphs, including:Paragraph 1: Your introductory paragraph should describe what you saw on stage. You should also give context for the play, such as the playwright or composer of the play and where the play is being staged.
Paragraph 2: Briefly summarize the plot of the play.
Paragraph 3: Discuss the acting and directing. React to the performers playing the characters in the play.
Paragraph 4: Describe the design elements of the production, such as the lighting, sound, costumes, make up, and set and props.
Paragraph 5: React to the play as a whole. Would you recommend the play to potential audience members? You can also include a recommendation, like a star rating or a thumbs up/thumbs down.

, Do a google search of local plays in your city that have reviews online. Pick up a newspaper and check the Arts & Culture section for play reviews. You can also access example reviews online.Read the review(s) and ask yourself:How does the reviewer structure her review? Does the review follow the traditional structure, with an introduction in paragraph 1, a plot summary in paragraph 2, a discussion of acting and directing in paragraph 3, a discussion of the production elements in paragraph 4, and an overall critique in paragraph 5?
Compare two reviews of the same play. How do the reviews compare and contrast? Are they structured differently or have different critiques of the play?
Is the reviewer overly critical of the play? Does their analysis seem well supported by scenes in the play, or a discussion of design elements of the play?
How does the reviewer wrap up the review? Is there a recommendation at the end of the article, such as a star rating or a thumbs up/thumbs down?

, If you are reviewing a popular play, like “Hamlet” or “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you should be able to find a hard copy of the play. Newer or more obscure plays may be harder to find in hard copy. Reading the play will help you get familiar with the subject matter and how it appears on the page before you see the production live.


Note the stage directions, the setting notes, and the line breaks or pauses in the dialogue.
Pick out any problematic points in the play that you might want to watch for during the production. For example, if you’re going to see Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”, you may make a note of ways the director might stage the pivotal Ophelia drowning scene. Or if you are going to a musical like “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you might note how the director will transition from the song numbers to the dialogue in the production.
Your instructor may also ask you to pay particular attention to certain elements, like the lighting or the costumes, so make sure you are prepared to recognize them.

, You don’t want to do too much research around the production as it may influence your viewing experience. But you should have a sense of the context of the production; which theater company is putting it on, who is directing the play, and what liberties, if any, have they taken with the original content.For example, you may be seeing a version of “Hamlet” that is set in contemporary times and integrates technology in the production. Or you may be seeing a production of “The Little Shop of Horrors” that is set in a record store, rather than a theater. This setting change will change the context of the play, and you should then note how the setting choice is used in the production in your review.

, Try to get to the theater or production setting 15 minutes before show time. Flip through the play’s program. Look for a director’s note and the cast biographies. You should also check if there are any understudy replacements for the production, especially if the show is promoting itself based on the popularity of a certain performer.Note if there are any write ups in the program about a directorial choice, like setting “Hamlet” in contemporary times. There may also be notes on the lighting or the sound design.

Don't: judge the premise of the play based on your personal tastes. Your readers can decide for themselves whether it appeals to them.Do: consider the goals behind production decisions and be prepared to evaluate whether the play achieves them.


, Its important to write down any striking details during the production. But try not to bury your head in your notebook during the entire production. You may miss certain details or a key moment. Use the intermission, which usually happens between acts in a play, to take more detailed notes. Consider:The set design. Look at design elements like lighting, sound, costumes, makeup, and props.
The acting and directing of the production. If a certain casting choice seems important, write it down. If a line of dialogue strikes you, make a note of it. Look at the way the actors say their dialogue and move around the stage. Are they serious, comedic, formal? Do they use modern slang or speech, even though the play was originally set in an older time period?
Any “special effects” used, such as special lighting, sound or technology. Note if the production also uses audience participation to keep the audience engaged.
Right after the performance, you should jot down any concluding notes, including your initial impressions of the production and how successful or unsuccessful you think the production was.

, The longer you wait, the less you’ll remember your experience of the play. Remember your role as a critic is to describe, analyze, and judge. In your review, you will need to:Describe what you saw in detail and make the reader see what you see. Be specific and thorough in your descriptions.
Analyze what you think the director or designer was trying to achieve. Why do you think they designed the movements, lights, sounds effects, and costumes a certain way? What do you think they were trying to make the audience feel or think?
Judge how effective the play was as a whole. Don’t be afraid to give an honest opinion of the production but be sure you can back up your critique in the body of your review (paragraphs 2-4).

Don't: make your persona opinion the main feature.Do: state your opinion honestly, grounded in specific points.


, You may start with a summary of the play if it is a re-staging of a production your audience is familiar with.For example, in this review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, the reviewer begins with the line: “This Fringe classic pops up most years, with songs such as ‘Somewhere That’s Green’ and ‘Don’t Feed The Plants’ bringing the house down.”This opening line works because it allows the reader to dive right in. In one line, the reviewer has introduced the play, noted the play is a “classic” and told the reader it is a popular musical.
You can also start with a hook that challenges the audience’s expectations of a familiar production. For example, in this review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, the reviewer begins with the line: “Not many musicals will issue you with a sing-a-long book with the lyrics to chorus numbers so you can join in, but this interactive production of The Little Shop of Horrors has a few surprises in store.”This hook works because it tells you that the play is a unique take on a classic production and is interactive.

Don't: write an exciting hook that has nothing to do with the rest of your review.Do: take risks with bold statements or an unusual opening.


, The introductory paragraph should cover basic information about the play, including:


The full title of the play.
Where did you see the show? Name the theater or setting where you saw the play.
When did you see the show? Maybe it was opening night, or the last week of the show’s run. Be specific about the exact date you saw the show.
Who wrote the show? Who directed the show? Name the playwright, the director, and the name of the production company.
If the show is a re staging of an existing play, such as “The Little Shop of Horrors” or “Hamlet”, you should note this in your introduction. If the show is a new or original production, you should also note this.

, Briefly summarize the plot of the play, including the setting, the main characters, and the story arc of the characters. Try to keep the summary to one or two lines. You should give the reader just enough information to get a general sense of the play’s plot.For example, you may summarize the plot of “The Little Shop of Horrors” with: “The Little Shop of Horrors is such an entertaining musical because of its hilarious plot involving a plant which grows to an incredible size and the romantic love story of Seymour and Audrey.”, React to the performers playing the characters in the play. Use their real names and their character names. Write about the acting based on questions such as:Were the performers believable? Did their relationships or chemistry with the other characters seem natural and appropriate? Did the performers stay in character throughout the play?
Did the performers have a vocal quality (volume and articulation) that fit the context of the play? Did their body movements and gestures stay true to the character they were playing?
Were the performers engaging and interesting to watch? If so, why did you find them engaging?
For example, in your review of “The Little Shop of Horrors” you may note: “The main credits of this production go to the lead roles Cath Snowball (as Audrey) and Chris Rushmere York as Seymour who created a really tangible but very shy and coy chemistry.”Don't: discuss an actor's personal appearance or insult to the point of cruelty.Do: describe misguided or failed performances honestly.


, The design elements are a big part of a production and should be discussed in detail in your review. Focus your analysis on:The set and the props: Did they establish the correct mood for the play? Did they add to the development of the characters, the plot, and the setting? Were they convincing and well-made?
Did the blocking on stage make sense? Blocking means how the actors are positioned on stage within the set. Were there any awkward movements by the actors on stage? Did the set help or hinder the performances?
The lighting: Did the lights convey a mood that fit with the tone of the play? Did they draw attention to characters or props that seemed important in the play?
The costumes and the make up: Did the costumes and the make up of the performers suit the time period of the show? Was there a unique approach to the costumes or the make up that affected the context of the play?
The sound: How did the music, if any, contribute to the show’s mood? Were there sound effects used in the show, and if so, how did they add to the production? If you are reviewing a musical, you should note if there was a live orchestra or if the music was pre recorded, and how that affected the tone of the play overall.
Try to be as detailed as possible in your discussion of the design elements. For example, in a review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you may note: “A quirky directorial decision was to have the props and cast in grey scale. These performers were caked in grey and black make up to contrast the monstrous green plant as it ate people alive, growing bigger and bigger as the play went on.”, Here is where your final critique should be in the review. Avoid clichéd phrases like “the play was bad” or “the production wasn’t very entertaining.” Instead state your opinion of the performance as a whole, and show why your response to the play is valid and significant. The rest of your review should support your overall judgment of the play.Note if the audience seemed attentive and interested throughout the performance. Also point to any possible adjustments or changes that could have been made to the production to make it stronger or more engaging.
For example, you may note: “Though the production was clearly taking some creative risks by having all the performers in grey scale, not bringing in bright green plants for the show-stopping “Something Green” number felt like a missed opportunity to capitalize on this contrast.”
Leave your reader with a clear sense of your opinion on the play and with more questions than answers about the play. For example, you may wrap up your review of “The Little Shop of Horrors” with: “This new production takes some creative risks and emphasizes the singing skills of the performers, who manage to pull off this tale of love and a monster plant with passion and conviction.”

Assess your label.,
Check for multiple tags or labels.,
Inspect the label and seam closely.,
Push the tip of the seam ripper under one stitch.,
Rip out several more stitches in a row.,
Wrap your finger around the tag to expose the stitches underneath.Your label will be loosened at this point, and you can get your seam ripper through the threads underneath it quickly and easily.,
Use tweezers to pull out any loose or remaining thread.,
Keep the label for referencing garment care information.",How to Remove Clothing Labels1," Labels are made of diverse materials and sewn into clothing in a variety of ways. You must remove them with care, or you risk accidentally tearing your clothing with the seam ripper.


Look for the best approach and point of entry to begin removal.
Make a mental note about the type of material the label is made of – is it made of soft fabric or something a little more rigid and paper-like?;
, They could be sewn into your garment side by side, or one on top of the other. If they are stacked, are they sewn in separately, or are the same stitches holding them both on?


Either way, you should start with the top tag when you begin the removal process, but now you know whether or not you’ll need to be doing additional stich removal on the second tag.

, Is the label sewn into the same seam that holds the garment together? Look closely at the threads – if you pull out the tag stitching, will it cause the seam to loosen and unravel?


If so, avoid using a seam ripper, since doing so will damage your clothing.
Instead, cut the label off close to the seam, leaving behind the stitching of the label. Don’t cut into the seam.

, Make sure the seam ripper is resting on top of the label rather than underneath it when you begin.Gently pull up and your seam ripper will cut through the thread easily.


Pulling the top stitches out first lessens the chance of an accidental tear in your clothing.
You can start anywhere, but it’s generally best to begin pulling stitches at the top right corner of the label.

, Move right to left as you work and pull the stitches out consecutively. Continue this process until all of the stitching is removed.


Be sure to be very gentle as you cut through the stitches so that you won’t damage your clothing with the sharp tip of your seam ripper.
For a slightly faster removal, stop at about the halfway mark and pull the label up so you can see underneath.

, Rip through those stitches and continue alternating until all of the stitching is removed.


Make sure to cut through each stitch. Don’t cut through a few of them until the label is loosened and then attempt to pull the rest of the stitches out.

, There will probably be a few stray threads embedded in your garment after you remove the label. Carefully tweeze them out, making sure the threads are totally loose before attempting to yank them out.

, One downside to removing a label is that most of them include care instructions for that particular item. Hang on to it if you think you’ll need it in the future.


Otherwise, you can either make a mental note or write the information down and keep it in a safe place.

Hire a lawyer if you are facing a lawsuit based on an outstanding debt.,
Find the documents from the debt.,
Read the documents to see if they refer to a time limitation for the debt.,
Search through state government websites to find what the statute of limitations is for your state and that specific type of loan.,
Establish the classification of the debt, whether written contract, oral contract, open contract or promissory note.,
Make a record of whether you switched states of residence between starting the debt and defaulting on it.,
Keep in mind that the age of the debt may start when you defaulted.,
Never ignore legal documents regarding a debt.,
Review whether the debt is held by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).",How to Evaluate the Statute of Limitations on Debt," If you have low income, you may be able to apply to have a lawyer appointed with your state's ""Modest Means"" program or through a non-profit organization. An attorney is the only person who is allowed to give you legal advice about debt.;
, You should keep track of the original agreement, updates, correspondence from the lender, correspondence from collection agencies and legal documents.


However, even if you have an oral agreement from a debt, you may still be required to pay the debt far after the date of its origin.
You can protect yourself from unfair debt collection practices by keeping a journal of all the attempts made by collection agencies to collect debts. There are laws in place, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), to protect debtors from illegal debt collection practices, such as violence and certain types of harassment.

, Review the documents and give a copy to your lawyer for review.

, Your lawyer can also help you to do this research, if they do not already know the laws.

, Each type of debt has a different set of limitations. For example, in many states an oral debt has a shorter statute of limitations than a written or promissory loan. In other states, the debt time limit is the same for all classifications.

, Your lawyer may be able to make an argument for a shorter statute of limitations, according to living in a different state. However, the opposing side may try to apply the longest statute of limitations.

, The statute of limitations will extend further than the origin of the loan, to the start of the time when you stopped making payments according to the loan agreement.

, Even if a debt has exceeded its statute of limitations, failure to appear in court and appeal the lawsuit may result in a judgment against you. You can use the statute of limitations to get a case dismissed after it's filed.

, The IRS has the ability to collect an outstanding debt on taxes up to 10 years from the date of the original tax assessment. Keep all tax records for 10 years, in case of auditing or lawsuits on the federal level.

Define your passions.,
Develop your career plan.,
Organize your thoughts.,
Practice the conversation.",How to Tell Your Parents You Don't Want to Follow in Their Footsteps1," If you make money your top priority, you are likely to end up in a career that you hate. Instead, you should focus on doing things that interest you personally. If you can start these things as a career right away, that’s great. If not, make time for hobbies or volunteering to find things that fulfill you.Some common themes that people seek in their careers are the ability to be creative, the power to set their own schedule, financial stability, etc.;
, Once you find things that you enjoy doing, you can start thinking about how they can be utilized in a career. You can start by typing in an online search, or going to local businesses that you think could use your skills. It is important to seek careers that utilize your unique talents, as this will set you apart from others and fuel your drive and passion.For example, if you love to write, but are not interested in writing novels, you could explore companies that need writers. You can write content for web pages, advertisements, and a whole range of applications if you make it a priority to find those jobs.
Part of this plan should be planning for setbacks. If you anticipate your parents will be upset by your choice to follow a different path, their disapproval may cause certain complications. For instance, they may decide not to fund your college tuition if you choose to become a writer instead of taking over the family business as they had hoped. Figure out how you would handle these setbacks by looking into scholarships and student loans, etc.
You can learn a lot about any field by reading literature in your chosen field and by studying the most successful individuals in that field. You can start by reading biographies, or taking an internship under a respected professional in the field., You know why you want to choose this career, but your parents may not. Use any extra materials you can find to make your point. You can get handouts detailing your career. Make sure that you include salary ranges, employability, and benefits that come with your chosen career. Use this information to figure out the main points of your conversation and to make an outline. You can take the outline with you to the conversation, or just practice it beforehand., This conversation can often be hard to have. Beyond getting your thoughts organized, it can be a good idea to practice the conversation with a friend or another relative. You could also write down any important points that you want to make, especially if they are hard to bring up."

Select your handguns.,

Fire both pistols at the same time or alternately.,
As you alternate, try to keep the unused pistol in the low ready position between shots.",How to Dual Wield Pistols (Handguns)," This technique can be used with revolvers or pistols. The pistols should ideally be the same, or at least similar in size, weight and firing ability.;
,, Make sure you are equally good at shooting accurately with both your left and right hand.

,, No matter what you've seen in John Woo movies, the human eye can't accurately aim two pistols at once, so use point shooting. This will lower your accuracy, but the alternative is painfully slow shooting.

, If you fire both pistols in different directions, check in advance that there's nothing that would be dangerous or irresponsible to shoot in the direction you aren't looking. And naturally, shooting in a direction without looking will be very bad for that hand's accuracy.

Pay off your credit card on time every month.,
Wait for a little bit before enrolling in two credit cards.,
Use your loyalty as a bargaining chip.,
Dispute any charges that aren't accurate.",How to Get Good Credit at a Young Age," A credit score is a measure of how responsible you are with credit. Do you pay your bills quickly and in full, or do you just pay the monthly minimum, and late at that? There are a lot of factors that make up your credit score, and knowing them will help you plan for good credit:



Payment history — 35%. How often do you pay your bills on time? Late payments hurt your score.

Debt usage — 30%. How much debt do you have in relation to your overall limit? Low debt and high limits is what you're after.

Credit age — 15%. How long have you been establishing your credit? The longer the better.

Account mix — 10%. How many accounts or lines of credit do you have open? The more the better.

Inquiries — 10%. How often do you apply for new credit? Too many inquiries can hurt your score.;
, Ask your parents to help you set up your own bank account if you're younger than 18. In today's digital world, it's very hard to maintain good credit and pay off credit cards without the help of a bank account.


Open both a savings account and a checking account. Put money that you want to save for a rainy day or for investment into the savings account. Put money that you'll use to pay off your credit card or other debt into the checking account.

, If you're younger than 18, have a talk with your parents about co-signing. (You can't apply for a credit card yourself if you're under 18.) Understand a few things about your credit card before you use it.


You need to have a steady source of income to qualify for a credit card. You parents will be able to apply and then add you as an authorized user, but if you're applying on your own, a monthly allowance from your parents doesn't count!
If your parents act as co-signers on your account, they'll be responsible for monthly payments. You'll be responsible, too, but any bad decisions will affect them. Understand that before you go on a vicious spending spree and max out your credit card.
Use your credit card for things you can afford, not for the things you can't. If you want to establish good credit, use your credit card only when you have the cash to pay off your debt. Otherwise, your credit ship will slowly start sinking.

, This may require your parents becoming co-signers (and you would have to be 18), but if you have proven yourself to be responsible, your parents should be happy to oblige. Depending on where you live, you may have to hold car insurance and then provide various proofs of identification and income.


Don't just buy a car because you feel you need to establish good credit. If you're going to buy a car and want to finance it with a loan, this is a decent option. Having another line of credit open will help your score if you repay the loan.
But know, too, that paying a loan on something like a car will end up being more expensive in the long run than paying for the car with cash. You'll be paying interest payments.

, Ask your parents to help you build good credit early. This can be done by having them transfer some household bills into your name. The more bills you pay on time and in full, the better your credit score will be in the long run.


You don't even need to pay for the bills yourself. Have your parents transfer the money into your account and let you pay off the bills.

, Your limit is the maximum amount of money that you can charge to your credit card. As a young person, your limit will probably hover anywhere from $300 to $2,000.


Don't get sucked into spending lots of money just because you have a high limit. Your limit is something you should be afraid of, not mesmerized by. You should never charge your card for the limit unless it's an emergency.

, If you don't use your credit card during a month, you won't have to make payments on it. But if you do use your credit card, you'll have three options of how to pay back the money. You can pay the balance in full, you can pay an amount smaller than the balance, or you can pay the monthly minimum. The monthly minimum is the amount that you're forced to pay or you'll be dinged with a late payment. Only paying the monthly minimum will make your credit score worse.

, Interest is a small fee that the lender charges you for the privilege of borrowing money. High interest rates are bad. If your credit card comes with a 10% interest rate and you charge your card for $500, you could be hit with $50 in interest charges and still have to pay back $500. You got $500, but you had to pay $550. That's not a great deal.


Usually, if you don't pay your full balance, your interest rate payments will start kicking in on the amount that you haven't paid. So, if you balance is $500 and you pay off $250, check your interest rate. If your yearly interest rate is 12%, you're going to pay 1% each month: $500 - $250 = $250 x .01 = $2.5 for that month.
Look for a low-APR card. APR stands for annual percentage rate. It's the interest rate associated with the card (what was discussed above). If your APR is 10% and you charge $1,000 on your card, you'll have to pay $1,000 x .10 = $100 in interest on your card. That's $1,100 for the privilege of spending $1,000.

, Credit utilization is a fancy term that's actually pretty easy to understand. Also called debt to limit ratio, it's a relation of how much debt you owe to how much total debt you can carry. For credit cards, you want a low credit utilization.


If you have $300 of debt on your credit card and your total limit is $600, you get your credit utilization by dividing your debt with your limit. 300 ÷ 600 = .5 = 50%. 50% is a pretty high credit utilization.
If you have $100 of debt on your credit card and your total limit is $1,000, your credit utilization would be 100 ÷ 1,000 = .10 = 10%. 10% is a great credit utilization percentage.
A really good credit utilization is about 10%, but the average credit utilization is anywhere from 25% - 35%. If you're in that range, you're doing good.

, Don't be scared of your credit score. You can check it online for free once a year from any one of the three major credit bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. Know that you'll have three credit scores out there, with each one being possibly different.

, If you use your credit card to purchase things you can't afford, you'll have trouble paying off your credit card balance. If you have trouble paying off your credit card balance, your credit score will go down. If you pay off your balance in full every month, you'll have a great credit score.

, Memorize the due date for your card, and always pay at least part of your bill before that date. Payment due dates are usually a few days after the beginning of the month, but check your credit card statement to be sure. A late payment will hurt your credit score.

, One way to increase your credit score is to have two cards and only use one regularly. There are advantages and disadvantages to this strategy.


Advantage: Your total credit limit goes up. If you have one card with a limit of $600, your total credit limit is $600. But if you have two credit cards, each with a limit of $600, your total credit limit is $1,200. As we learned earlier, a higher limit will lower your credit utilization, giving you a better credit score.
Disadvantage: If you haven't established good credit yet, your credit score will take a hit if you apply for a second card too soon.Wait a year or two before applying for a second card. When you do apply, only use that credit card for small purchases.

, If you happened to forget about a payment and have that looming on your credit score, try to use your loyalty to the credit card company in order to have that late payment forgiven.You'll usually need to submit a request in writing, but it can't hurt to try.

, Sometimes, there'll be a mix up with the credit card company and you'll be charged or penalized for something you didn't buy or wasn't your fault. In these instances, you'll need to be very careful about disputing charges you're not to blame for.


Call up the small credit and collection agencies on your credit report and calmly ask them to prove you and your address were in fact associated with defaulted payments. Smaller companies are going to have a tough time providing such details, making it easier for it to be removed from your report.
Do the same for companies that have merged or closed down — if the information about you cannot be verified, you can request for it to be removed and make your credit score better almost instantly.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Paint glue on the eggshells.,
Sprinkle alum on the glue before it dries.,
Make a saturated alum solution.,
Place the egg in the saturated alum solution.,
Let the container sit for at least 24 hours.",How to Grow Alum Crystals3," To make fake geodes you will need eggshells, a glass container, alum, hot water, craft glue, a small paintbrush, and food coloring. All of these items are readily available at the grocery store. You can find alum in the spice aisle as it is used for pickling vegetables.The eggshells need to be cut in half, washed out, and dried before use.
The food coloring is optional, but it allows you to color the crystals of the geode.
The glass container needs to be large enough for the eggshell to be completely immersed in water.

, Pour some craft glue onto a piece of newspaper and use a paintbrush to coat the inside of the eggshell. You only need a thin layer of glue; just enough for the alum to stick to the surface.Don’t let the glue dry between this step and the next.

, While the glue is still wet, sprinkle some alum powder onto the glue. The powdered alum will serve as a starting point for a crystal to grow. If you want smaller crystals, completely coat the inside of the egg with alum because the crystals will not be able to grow very large when they are close together.If you want larger crystals, lightly sprinkle the alum making sure there is some space between the powder granules.
Leave the eggshell to dry overnight.

, Use hot water to make a solution that is completely saturated with alum (no more alum will dissolve). Use enough water to fill your container so that the eggshell will be completely immersed. Add a tablespoon of alum and stir to dissolve. Keep adding alum until no more dissolves in the water. At this point, the solution is saturated.Add food coloring to change the color of the geode.
Cool the solution to room temperature.

, Once the solution is cooled, transfer it to the container you will use for the growth phase. Gently place the egg into the container and make sure it is completely covered by the solution.Cover the top of the container with plastic wrap or foil to keep dust out.

, As time passes, the alum crystals will grow larger from the starting points on the eggshell. It can take a few days for the crystals to grow to a respectable size. Check on the eggshell geode each day and remove it from the solution when you are satisfied with the growth of the crystals.Store the experiment in a place where it will not be bumped. If it gets bumped or moved around, the crystals will not form properly.
Once you remove the eggshell from the solution, you will have made an alum crystal geode!

Find a quiet, featureless space.,
Find a soft surface.,
Remove distractions.,
Sit in a comfortable position.",How to Meditate on Breath1," Find a space without loud noises or noticeable odors that might distract you. You should also avoid spaces with excessive decoration or colors that might draw your attention.Indoor spaces are less likely to have distracting sounds but you can meditate outside if you prefer the fresh air and you have some distance from cars or other people.;
, Most people sit down when they meditate so find a spot where you can sit comfortably for more than 10 minutes. Plush carpeting or soft grass are ideal. You could also lay down a yoga mat or even just a towel.

, Turn off or silence your phone and anything else that might make a noise. If there are other people around, tell them you plan to meditate and ask to be left alone for the next few minutes. If you have pets that may come looking for attention, put them in another room where they can’t distract you.


Tell other people in the house “Please do not disturb me for the next 30 minutes unless it’s an emergency. I will be meditating and need to maintain absolute focus.”

, There are many different positions you can use for meditation. The key is to choose a position that is comfortable and won’t require you to consciously prop yourself up.Some meditators purchase a zafu, a small floor pillow, or a zabuton, a small padded mat, to help prop them up.
The most popular posture is the lotus position. Sit on the floor with your back straight. Place your left foot under your right thigh and right foot layered over the left ankle. If you are meditating for a long period of time, you may want to switch which foot goes under the thigh after a while.
Some meditators sit in a chair. Make sure you keep your back straight and your feet flat on the ground.

Accept the idea of change.,
Think about how the difference will affect you.,
Think about the good things that can occur through change.,
Learn to see things from a different perspective.,
Know that embracing change nurtures your personal growth.",How to Openly Embrace Change in Our Daily Lives," Change is a natural process which can be noticed as a cycle of life. For instance, a child changes into an adolescent during puberty. His or her physiology is bound to change, as well as his or her mentality. It is important to realize that development is an ongoing process that continues all throughout life. As you enter adulthood, navigate middle age and face the onset of old age, having a greater understanding of how people continue to grow and change as they get older can help you appreciate and manage all the stages of your life. Hence, change is an important process that helps you grow into mature persons. If you embrace change and accept change without trying to prevent it, you can be ready to react to whatever the world throws at you. Be proactive!;
, Seasons change, people change, a lot of changes can occur in our daily lives at work, at home, at school, etc., so obviously the only thing that remains constant is change. So you can either sit and nag about it while waiting for the storm to pass, or you can embrace it and learn to dance in the rain. Seasons change from winter to spring so that nature could blossom all over again. When the caterpillar is caught by change, it leaves its cocoon which represents one stage of life in order to become a butterfly so it can spread its wings and fly away. No matter how bad the change might appear to be, always stay positive about it.

, Think about the bright side of the circumstances. For instance, if you’re about to move to a new school, you’ll make plenty of new friends that could sometimes be better than the ones from your old school.

, If you want to grow wisely, then learn to see things from a different perspective, because when things are bound to happen in a certain way, all you can do is treat the situation from that perspective. For instance, if you had a fight with your loved one and broke up, it might be a good sign after all. In fact, you would have learned so many things that you could apply in your next relationship in order to be more successful!

, While it may seem daunting at first, you will be able to see the positive aspects of being somewhere new or doing new things. In order to aim for the best, you should let go of the chains that keep you hanging on to a routine, or the fear of trying something new. After all, how would you develop and grow wiser if you keep living in the old familiar, constantly doing the same things? Always remember that change is good once in a while.

Pace yourself early in the workout.,
Run the last mile faster than the first miles.,
Keep up with someone in front of you.",How to Push Yourself Through the Last Mile of a Run1," A good strategy to help you make it through that last mile of your run is to pace yourself through your entire run. Many people start off running fast because they are energized and excited, but by the last mile, they feel fatigued and their energy levels have depleted. To make sure you can push yourself through that last mile, try to keep an even pace.To pace yourself, start off slower than what you feel like you can run. You want to make sure that you use roughly the same pace through the entire run to save energy for the last mile.
If you have problems pacing yourself, use a running app on your phone that can help calculate how fast you run each mile. You can also use a watch or stopwatch and give yourself a set time limit for when you want to finish each mile.
For example, if you are running a 5K, you want each of the three miles to be around the same duration. You may be able to run a nine minute mile for the first mile, but that leads to you walking part of the last mile. Instead, try to run each mile between 11 and 12 minutes.;
, If you are struggling to get through that last mile, try rearranging your pace so that you run your last mile faster. This means you have to consciously run slower at the beginning to conserve your energy. Once you hit the last mile, increase your speed and run faster. This helps you push through that last mile and get it over faster than the early miles.For example, if you are running a 10K, you may run the first five miles at a significantly slower pace. Then, once you hit that five mile mark, you increase your pace to finish strong. If your average mile is a nine minute mile, you may run the first five miles at 11 to 12 minutes, then increase to a nine to 10 minute mile in the last mile.
Consider cutting the run in half. Run the first half at a slower pace and then run the last half at a faster pace. You may run the first three miles at a 13 minute mile but then increase your speed to a 10 minute mile for the last three, which can help you push through to the end.

, If you are running a race and you are unsure you are going to finish that last mile, choose someone in front of you running at a reasonable pace and stay with them. Use them as a running buddy and motivation tool.Setting your sights on someone ahead of you can help keep you moving, give you something visual to move towards, and keep you motivated. This can help you push through that last mile.

Decide what you want to share about your self-inflicted scar.If you have a self-inflicted scar or scars, people (including teens) might ask you about it out of curiosity, or because they know someone who has a self-inflicted scar themselves.,
Talk to your friends about your scars.,
Don’t feel obligated to talk about your scars.If a stranger or acquaintance approaches you and expresses interest in how you received your scar, you might not want to share the story with them.,
Network with others who struggle with their scars.Sharing stories and feelings about having a scar can help your normalize your own experience.,
Consult a therapist.You might be uncomfortable with your scar because it causes you embarrassment or shame.",How to Feel Comfortable With a Scar3," Talking candidly about your scar can help you become more comfortable with it, but listen closely to the person’s tone and line of questioning to decide what you want to share with the person who is asking.


Perhaps the curious individual is engaging in self-harm themselves and asking you about it because they have nobody else to talk to about it.
Stay attuned to the tone of the conversation and delve deeper with the person if possible. You could, for example, say to them, “This scar is a reminder of a rough patch I went through. Do you know anyone who has engaged in self-harm?”
Use these conversations as opportunities to educate and inform others about the difficulties of self-harm and related scars.
Talking through your experience with others can often help you feel more comfortable with your scar and might inspire someone else to make a positive change.
Do not share information about your scar if you are not comfortable doing so.

, Good friends will support you and be understanding of the difficulty you have in opening up about your scar. You should also direct your friends about what to say if someone asks them about your scar.


People often feel uncomfortable asking about something obvious but private like a scar. Curious people who don’t know you well may, therefore, ask your friends what happened instead of asking you.
Provide your friends with directions about how you’d like them to answer these questions.
For instance, if you want to maintain control over the distribution of information regarding your scar, you should tell your friends to direct all questions to you. Your friends might answer a question about your scar by saying, “I don’t think my friend would appreciate me talking about it. You will have to ask him/her.” This is a good option when the scar is personal.
Role play with your friends to ensure they understand your wishes about what is acceptable to share about your scar. Pretend to be a stranger asking for information about your scar and ask probing questions.
Talking to your friends about your scar can show your friends that you trust them with sensitive information and help deepen your friendship.

, Politely but firmly deny their request for further information by saying, “I don’t want to talk about it,” or “Thank you for your concern, but that is a private matter.” Do not share information with people you don’t feel comfortable sharing with.

, The Scar Information Service offers a long list of scar-related groups on its website at http://www.smith-nephew.com/awm/scar-info/useful-contacts/scar-related-organisations/. Consult this list and search for a support group near you.


If you don't find a group near you, consider starting one, or joining a general group for individuals with body image issues.
You might also have success looking for groups related to your specific type of scar. For instance, you might be able to talk about breast cancer scars in a breast cancer support group.

, In order to work through those issues and confront your feelings about the scar, you may need to speak with a therapist. Therapists are specially trained to help you confront the complicated feelings you have about your scar.

Create a happiness jar.,

Download their favorite tunes.,
Post Post-It notes.",How to Make Up for Forgetting Someone's Birthday3," When you feel badly enough about forgetting a person’s birthday that you want to make it up to them somehow, it signals that you have a special relationship of some kind. It indicates you truly care. Making that person a happiness jar can show this. All it takes is a Mason jar with a lid, paper and a pen. Of course you can get more creative, but what matters most is what you write. On each piece of paper that you put in the jar, write down a memory you have of the person – something you experienced together, something you remember the other person saying or doing one day, the way he or she looked on a special occasion, how you feel about the person now and at different times since you’ve known one another.


Include one larger piece of paper or a small card saying you’re sorry for missing his or her birthday.
If there’s room left, throw in their favorite candies, tokens to the arcade if you do that together, small items the person might collect and so forth.
Decorate the jar if you’d like. Tie a ribbon around it, paint on it, hodge podge a photo of the two of you on one side., Sometimes the person doesn’t live nearby, and while you can call, email, send a card or a traditional present, maybe you’re also looking for something with a bit more punch behind your apology. Here’s one idea. Videotape yourself as you make the person his or her favorite kind of birthday cake. You could make it humorous or you could pretend as if you’re the star of a cooking show, which the other person might also find quite funny. You could even light the candles, sing him or her “Happy Birthday” and then express your apologies.


Burn your video to a disc, write out the cake recipe and wrap it like a birthday present before you send it in the mail.
If you think the cake will survey the journey, send it, too, or perhaps just a slice.

, If you’ve never looked online before, USB flash drives now come in all shapes, sizes, colors and materials. There are even action hero USB flash drives. You can also have them customized from a variety of online sites, which is exactly what you want to do. Since they’re small and you won’t have much space to convey your message, keep it simple, or consider using a symbol or photo. Then fill it with the other person’s favorite music (music that you own, of course).Add photos of you together. Create a special playlist.
Before you give it to the other person, go online and print a piece of blank sheet music. Write your apology and birthday wishes on it when you present the USB drive.

, If you have access to the person’s home, buy a package of multi-colored Post-It notes and write a variety of messages on them, tailored to the person and your relationship – memories, quotes, feelings, jokes. Tape small photos or other mementos, such as a ticket from a concert you went to together, to some of them. While he or she is not home, stick them in both obvious and more hidden places throughout the house so they’re found not only when the person comes home and sees them everywhere, but also over time.


Then tape several together to create a card expressing your apology that you can either leave after you’ve gone Post-It note crazy or that you can be waiting to hand deliver."

Make sure your potted cannas get plenty of sunlight.,
Bring your pot inside before the first frost.",How to Grow Cannas," Cannas are a warm weather plant that don’t do well in cold weather. Wait until spring to plant your cannas--when the soil becomes soft and warm from sunlight, its time to get planting.If you live in a colder area where the warm season is rather short, you could consider starting your cannas in an indoor pot. See Part Three for how to care for indoor cannas.;
, As tropical plants, cannas require a lot of sun. A lot of sunlight will allow your cannas to bloom to their full extent--and that’s something you definitely want. Cannas are known for the bright, beautiful flowers and intricate and colorful leaf patterns. Give your plant the sun it needs and you will be sure to have an exquisite garden.

, While cannas will survive in almost any soil, it does need to be able to drain. The way to tell if you have found a good spot is to check on the spot after a rain shower (or hose shower). If the soil still has puddles five or six hours after a shower, you will have to find another spot. While cannas do like moist soil, they don’t like soggy roots.


If you don’t have another spot to plant you cannas, you can help your spot to dry by adding organic material to the spot. You can raise the level two or three inches using compost, peat moss, or ground bark--all of which you can buy at your local garden or yard supply store.

, If you are going to plant one of the tall varieties of cannas, you will need to choose a spot where these tall beauties will be relatively protected from strong wind. In a strong wind, cannas stalks can snap or bend in a damaging way., You can do this with a tiller or garden fork. Mix in a layer of compost that is 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 cm) deep. The compost will give the soil an extra boost of nutrients that your cannas will appreciate., Place a single tuber (or rhizome) in the hole with the eye (or growing points) facing up. Plant additional tubers approximately 1 foot (.30 m) apart for dwarf to medium varieties and at least 2 feet (.61 m) apart for tall varieties., Press the soil down and water thoroughly. Watering the area will help to settle the soil around the tuber.

, The mulch will help retain moisture and will also keep the weed population at bay., Your sprouts should begin to show their heads a couple of weeks after planting, though if you live in a colder climate it might take a week or two longer. Cannas need heat to help them begin growing. For optimum blooming, apply a fertilizer rich in nitrogen to cannas about once a month.

, Cannas need moist soil, so its important to water your cannas regularly. If you live in an area where rainfall is one inch or less (2.54 cm) each week, you will need to water your cannas once a week. If you find yourself in a dry spell, water whenever you notice the soil getting dry., If you notice that your taller cannas are a little droopy, tie them to stakes to help them grow and support their own weight. Learn how to stake your plants here.

, As your plant’s flowers bloom and fade away, remove the dead foliage. You can tell what is dead by looking for a faded brownish yellow color. Pick these away, taking care that you don’t disrupt the still living parts of the plant. Do not cut leaves until they yellow because they will continue to provide nutrients to the plant even when it is not blooming., If you live in an area that gets frost, you will need to dig up your rhizomes after the frost kills the foliage of your cannas. Cut the plants back so that they are six inches tall and carefully dig the rhizomes up from the ground.


Some cannas specialists believe that you should let the rhizomes dry for several days before moving onto the next step., Both peat moss and perlite can be purchased at your local garden supply store. Once you have filled the box, place each bunch of rhizomes in the box, making sure that each plants rhizomes don’t touch one another.


You can also put them in a brown paper bag lined with peat moss or perlite if you don’t have a plastic box to spare.

, You should pick a spot that can have a maintained temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F (7.2 to 12.7 degrees C). Check on them every once in a while. If you notice that the moss is getting dry, lightly spray it with water so that it gets slightly damp. Your cannas will go into hibernation during this time, and will be able to be replanted in the spring, just like the first time you planted them., Dwarf cannas grow to about three feet tall. They come in a variety of colors, such as the bright red Ambassador or the City of Portland, which is known for its salmon color. Regular cannas are much larger in size, so dwarf cannas tend to grow better when potted., Potted cannas will grow in almost any potting medium that can be purchased at a garden supply store--they’re really not very picky. However, it must be soil that drains well, as cannas don’t do well with soggy roots and could develop mold.

, You will also have to choose your container based on the size of the variety of canna you are choosing to plant. If you are not sure how large your specific canna can grow, run an online search or ask someone to help you at your garden supply store.Remember, you can plant your cannas with other plants in your container, but just remember that all of the plants in one container must have the same water and sunlight needs or else they will not do very well.

, Plant your rhizomes (or tubers) in these holes, making sure that each dwarf or medium rhizome is at least 1 foot (.30 m) away from the next rhizome, unless you are planting them in a container, in which case you can often fit two or three tubers in a container. If you have a larger variety of canna rhizome, make sure that there is at least 2 feet (.61 m) distance between rhizomes. Make sure that the growing points (or eyes of the tuber) or pointing up., You should water your cannas right after you plant them so that the soil will settle around them and they can start to grow. When they have begun to sprout, water your plant as much as needed, keeping an eye on the soil to make sure that it is always relatively moist (though not soaking wet).

, It is recommended that you bring your cannas outside so that they can get full sunlight during the warm months. If you do choose to keep them inside, make sure they are near a window that provides them with bright sunlight for most, if not all, of the day.

, If you did bring your cannas outside for the summer months, make sure that you bring them back inside before the first frost has the chance to harm them. Store them indoors where the temperature stays at around 45 and 60 degrees F (7.2 to 15.5 degrees C).You can also dig up the rhizomes and store them in a plastic box with peat moss or perlite.

Plant trees.,
Plant wildflowers.,
Welcome animals into your yard.,
Talk to your neighbors about going organic.,
Commit to protecting local wild places.,
Clean up litter in your community.",How to Celebrate Earth Day2," As the date of Earth Day roughly coincides with U.S. Arbor Day, planting trees is a popular Earth Day activity. Trees helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean pollution, secure soil in place to prevent erosion, and provide homes for many birds, insects and other animals. There's almost no more important, long-lasting act you can do to celebrate Earth Day.


Pick a tree that you know can survive in your climate. It's best to find a species native to where you live. If you're unsure about what that might be, ask an employee at your local garden shop, or inside the garden department of a big-box store.
To ensure that the tree grows tall and strong, make sure you plant it correctly. Choose the correct planting spot to meet its needs, dig a properly-sized hole, and water the tree well to give it a good start.

, Choose flowers that are native to your area and plant them in your garden or on nature strips where plants are usually grown. Restoring the local plant life will help attract native bird life, pollinators and local mammals. Here are a few examples of common flowers that will draw wildlife:


If you want to attract Monarch butterflies, plant milkweed, pansies or goldenrod.If you want to attract bees, plant bee balm, lavender or sage.
If you want to attract hummingbirds, plant foxglove, petunias or lilies., You can do a lot for the creatures of the earth starting in your own yard or neighborhood. In their quest for the perfect lawn, many people drive out the insects, rodents, birds and reptiles that need a place to call home just as much as we do. Starting on Earth Day, why not welcome these nonhuman neighbors into your yard? Here's how to do it.


Instead of mowing the entire yard, leave a few sections unmowed. Bees, butterflies, and many other insects will find this inviting. If you're worried about them coming inside, have the unmowed area in the back of the yard instead of right next to the house.
Install a bird feeder, bat feeder, squirrel feeder, hummingbird feeder, or any other type of feeder to attract more wild animals.
Provide a source of water, like a bird bath or a small pond.
Don't try to get rid of snakes, lizards, frogs, moles, squirrels, and the other creatures who want to hang out in your yard. Many of these animals are beneficial; they aerate your yard, eat mosquitoes and improve biodiversity in the area. Live and let live. Tell your neighbors to do the same!

, Pesticides and herbicides can harm wild animals, native plants, trees, pets, and even humans. Make Earth Day the day you stop using chemicals in your yard and try organic methods of weed and pest removal instead. Consider talking to your neighbors about making the whole neighborhood organic.


Getting rid of pests the old-fashioned way can actually be more effective than using pesticides. Try planting native plants to control the insect population. Use water to spray common insects like aphids off of your vegetable plants.
When it comes to weeds, pulling them out by hand works better than any other method.

, Whether you live near an ocean, river, forest, mountain, swamp or lake, wild areas like these need protection. They are home to many plants and animals who rely on them for food and shelter. On Earth Day, commit to protecting the wild places in your community by doing the following:


Join a group working to protect these areas from pollution and developments.
Encourage people to respect wild spaces by not damaging animal habitats, littering, and dumping in the water.

, Many groups use the weekend of Earth Day to clear roadways, highways and neighborhood streets of litter that has accumulated since the last clean-up day.Many companies donate gloves and bags for clean-up groups and villages organize bag pick ups. Once the group has collected the trash and placed the recycled bags along the road, get the village public works department to pick the bags up. It's a wonderful community project that you can do as an individual or with a group.

Stay calm.,
Learn to forgive.,
Think about how others feel.,
Trust that you are a good person.,

Don't give too much.,
Don't be boring.",How to Be a Nice Guy," Helpfulness is one of the hallmarks of a nice guy. Look for ways that you can be more helpful to everyone around you, and remember that even small gestures are appreciated.Pay attention to how your friends and loved ones are feeling. If they seem overwhelmed by something, always offer to help them in whatever way you can. For example, if your mom is stressed out about a party she is hosting, offer to help clean the house or pick up the groceries she needs.
Help people you don't know as well. You can do this by volunteering for charitable organizations, or even just by helping a stranger pick up a stack of papers that he dropped in the hallway.
Don't expect to get anything in return. Kindness is often repaid, but your goal should not be to be rewarded for your helpfulness.;
, Nice guys take the time to really listen when someone is talking to them. The next time you're having a conversation with someone, be sure to listen attentively and respond in a meaningful way.Avoid distractions that might make the other person think you're not listening. Always put your phone away when you're having a conversation and maintain eye contact to show that you are fully engaged.
Don't interrupt people, even if you think you know what they're about to say. Always let them finish talking before you share your thoughts.

, Nice guys always express gratitude when other people do nice things for them. No matter how big or small the gesture, always say thank you when someone else does something nice for you.Consider doing something nice in return. For example, if a friend surprised you with concert tickets, consider treating her to lunch the next time you see her.
Be grateful to people you don't know too. If a stranger holds the elevator for you, for example, be sure to thank her.

, Happiness is contagious and it makes people want to spend time with you. The happier you are, the nicer you will be perceived by others, so make an effort to smile and laugh a little more each day.Always smile when you see somebody, whether you know them or not. Your smile might just make someone else's day a lot brighter.
Smiling and laughing will also make you feel happier, which will make it much easier to be nice to other people.

, People do not like liars, so it's very important to be open and honest with everyone. This includes never pretending to be someone you're not, even if you think it will make people like you more.While it's important to tell the truth, be sure to consider how the truth might hurt someone else's feelings, and always weigh the pros and cons before you say something potentially hurtful. For example, it may be a good idea to tell a friend that his girlfriend is cheating on him, but it's probably not a good idea to tell him that you think his shoes are ugly (unless he asks).
If you have already lied to someone, consider coming clean and telling the truth. It will take a lot of weight off of your shoulders, and the other person will probably appreciate your honesty.

, Nice guys should treat everyone respectfully. Start paying particular attention to the way you treat women, whether they're strangers, friends, or loved ones, to make sure that you're not being unintentionally offensive.Avoid using diminutives like ""babe"" or ""hun"" with friends and acquaintances. Many women find these terms belittling (although they may be acceptable if you're in a relationship with the woman).
Avoid talking about women's bodies. This can make them feel uncomfortable and objectified, even if you're being complimentary.
If you're in a relationship, never pressure a woman to do something she's not ready for.

, Nice guys are not hotheads, so if you have a problem with anger, you need to start working on it. Getting rid of anger will not only help others perceive you as a nice guy, but it will also help you feel much happier.Yoga and meditation can help you calm your mind and release stress, so consider incorporating these into your routine if you need more calmness in your life.

, In order to feel like a nice guy, it's important that you not hold on to grudges. No matter how badly another person has hurt you, make the decision to forgive instead of seeking vengeance.Forgiving does not necessarily mean that you need to accept the harmful action as acceptable; it simply means that you need to make the decision to not let the action affect you any longer.Forgiving is easier if you can start to think about the person who harmed you as a good person who did a bad thing, instead of villainizing the individual., Nice guys are not self-centered, which means that they are always aware of how their words and actions will affect others. If you want to be nicer, be sure to always take other people's feelings into consideration.The most successful nice guys consider how others think, how they feel, and how they are likely to act. This helps them engage with others in a way that is both kind and effective.
When you think about how others feel, being polite and respectful should come naturally. If you think that something you say or do might be offensive to another person, don't do it., No one is perfect all the time, and it can be easy to think that you are a bad person just because you lashed out at someone or did something else that you're not proud of. Unfortunately, thinking that you are a bad person makes you more likely to act like a bad person in the future, so it's extremely important that you don't judge yourself too harshly.The next time you do something that you're ashamed of, remind yourself that you are a good person who did something bad and that you will try not to do that bad thing again. Do not fall into the trap of believing that one bad action is a reflection of who you are as a person.
Keep in mind that feeling guilty about doing a bad thing is an indication that you really are a good person. If you were a bad person, you wouldn't feel guilty at all.

, People sometimes make the false assumption that nice guys are timid and insecure, so you need to prove them wrong! This means overcoming shyness, if this is a problem for you, and standing up for yourself if people are taking advantage of you.Just because you're a nice guy does not mean that you have to let people walk all over you. You can set boundaries to let people know how you expect to be treated without being a jerk. If someone treats you badly, don't be afraid to let them know that it is unacceptable.
Being outgoing, social, and self-confident can help you be a nice guy without all of the negative associations.

, Helping others is great, but if you help others so much that you begin to neglect yourself, you've gone too far. Try to find a balance between taking care of others and taking care of yourself.It's okay to say no to others if you feel that you are over-committed. Being a nice guy does not mean helping everyone with everything all the time, but rather helping people whenever you are reasonably able to.
Being too generous can also make people see you as a poor leader. If you want to be a strong leader, you may need to be careful about how much you are willing to give to others., For some reason, people often assume that nice guys are dull, inexperienced, and uninteresting. This is a completely false stereotype, so show everyone around you that you are both nice and interesting.Develop unique hobbies or travel to interesting places. This will give you plenty of fascinating things to talk about, so people will never think you're boring.
Do something unpredictable every so often, whether it's going on a last-minute road trip or trying a new activity that's out of your normal comfort zone.
There are lots of nice things that you can do that other people will also find very interesting. For example, traveling to help people who survived natural disasters, volunteering to help build houses for the poor, or organizing a fund raiser for a local charity are all great ways to do nice things for people without being boring or predictable.

Learn the names of the phases.,
Learn what the phases mean.,
Learn why the moon waxes and wanes.,

Remember D, O, C. Since the moon always follows the same illumination pattern, you can use the shape of the letters D, O, and C to determine if the moon is waxing or waning.,
Learn when the moon rises and sets.,
Learn which part of the moon is illuminated during waxing and waning.,
Remember C, O, D. The moon goes through all the same phases in the Southern Hemisphere, but the shapes of the letters that indicate waxing and waning are reversed from the Northern Hemisphere.,
Learn when the moon rises and sets.",How to Tell Whether the Moon Is Waxing or Waning," The moon revolves around the Earth, and as it does, we see different angles of the moon’s illuminated surface. The moon doesn’t create its own light, but rather shines when it reflects the sun’s light. As the moon transitions from new to full and back to new again, it goes through several phases, marked by its recognizable crescent and gibbous (""bulging"") shapes, which are created by the moon’s own shadow.The moon phases are:


New moon
Waxing crescent
First quarter
Waxing gibbous
Full moon
Waning Gibbous
Third quarter
Waning crescent
New moon;
, The moon travels the same path around the Earth every month, so it goes through the same monthly phases. The phases exist because from our perspective on Earth, we observe the illuminated portion of the moon differently as it makes its way around us. Remember that half the moon is always illuminated by the sun: it’s our vantage point on Earth that changes and determines what phase we see.During the new moon, the moon is between the Earth and the sun, and is therefore not illuminated at all from our perspective. At this time, the moon’s illuminated side completely faces the sun, and we see the side that’s in full shadow.
During the first quarter, we see half of the moon’s illuminated side and half of the moon’s shadowed side. The same is true in the third quarter, except the sides we see are reversed.When the moon appears full, we see its full illuminated half, while the side that’s in complete shadow faces out into space.
After the full moon, the moon continues its journey back to its original position between the Earth and the sun, which is another new moon.
It takes the moon a little over 27.32 days to complete one full revolution around the Earth. However, a full lunar month (from new moon to new moon) is 29.5 days, because that’s how long it takes the moon to return to its position between the sun and Earth., On the moon’s journey from new moon to full moon, we see a growing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called the waxing phase (waxing means growing or increasing). As the moon then goes from full to new again, we see a diminishing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called waning, which means decreasing in strength or intensity.


The moon’s phases always look the same, so although the moon itself may appear in different locations and orientations in the sky, you’ll always be able to identify what phase it’s in if you know what to look for.

, Different parts of the moon are illuminated during waxing and waning. In the Northern Hemisphere, the part of the moon that is illuminated will appear to grow from right to left until it’s full, and it will then diminish from right to left.


A waxing moon will be illuminated on the right side, and a waning moon will be illuminated on the left side.Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waxing moon (increasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the ""C"" curve then it is waning (decreasing).

, During the first quarter, the moon will look like a D. When it’s full, it will look like an O. And when it’s in the third quarter, it will look like a C.


A crescent moon in the shape of a backwards C is waxing
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a D is waxing.
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waning.
A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waning.

, The moon doesn’t always rise and set at the same time, but changes depending on what phase it’s in. This means you can use the time of moonrise and moonset to determine if the moon is waxing or waning.


You can’t see a new moon because it isn’t illuminated by the sun, and because it rises and sets at the same time as the sun.
As the waxing moon moves into its first quarter, it will rise in the morning, reach its height around dusk, and set around midnight.
Full moons come up when the sun goes down and set when the sun comes up.
As the waning moon moves into its third quarter, it will rise at midnight and set in the morning., In opposition to the moon in the Northern Hemisphere, the moon in the Southern Hemisphere will illuminate from left to right, become full, and then diminish from left to right.


A moon that’s illuminated on the left side is waxing, while a moon that’s illuminated on the right side is waning.Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waning moon (decreasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the ""C"" curve then it is waxing (increasing).

,


A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waxing
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waxing.
A moon in the shape of an O is full.
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a D is waning.
A crescent moon in the shape of a backwards C is waning.

, Although the moon may illuminate in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere versus the Northern, it will still rise and set at the same times during the same phases.


The first-quarter moon will rise in the morning and set around midnight.
The full moon rises and sets when the sun sets and rises.
The third-quarter moon will rise at midnight and set in the morning."

Remove large pieces of lipstick.,

Repeat if you are seeing good results.,
Hand wash the cleaning product and stain remnants.,
Rinse and dry the area.",How to Remove Lipstick From Carpet1," Use a spoon or dull knife to carefully scrape and remove any large pieces of lipstick from the carpet. Try to avoid pushing the pieces further into the carpet.;
, Lipstick stains attach to the carpet fibers with grease, so you will need a cleaning product that dissolves grease or oils.Most all-purpose stain removers will work, as will dry cleaning fluid. However, these may discolor your carpet. Apply the cleaning product to an inconspicuous corner of the carpet first and let sit five minutes before blotting dry with a clean cloth. If the discoloration is severe, you may wish to find another product.


Dry cleaning fluid is especially likely to discolor your carpet.If you do not have any stain removers or dry cleaning fluid, see the section on alternate cleaning solutions for other products or homemade mixtures you may have access to.

, Apply the cleaning product to a clean sponge or cloth. Press repeatedly over the stain, switching to a clean side if the cloth becomes heavily stained. Avoid rubbing, which may work the lipstick further into the carpet fibers or spread it to a wider area. Depending on the cleaning product, lipstick, and freshness of the stain, this step may remove the lipstick on its own.


Alternatively, you may spray the cleaning product onto your carpet and let sit five minutes before blotting. This may be more effective at removing the stain, but has a greater risk of discoloring your carpet.
Even if the stain is removed, skip to the end of this section for instructions on cleaning up traces of the solvent.

, If most of the stain has been removed, launder or rinse out the sponge or cloth, then apply more of the same cleaning product and blot. Two or three attempts may be enough to remove the stain, although you should stop and choose another product in the alternate cleaning solutions method if you see no major improvements.

, Whatever product you used, wash your carpet afterward to remove traces of cleaning product that could discolor your carpet or damage its fibers. Hand wash the area with a white cloth and a small amount of laundry or dish detergent mixed with warm water. Depending on how much stain is left, you may opt to use only a few grains of detergent in a glass of water; use 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) for a stronger mix or even form a granular paste that you can rub thoroughly against the carpet.Check the detergent ingredients first. Avoid products that contain lanolin or bleach, as these may damage your carpet.If you're uncertain, test the product in an inconspicuous area of the carpet, such as a corner usually underneath furniture.
If you do not own detergent, skip to the next step.

, Rinse the carpet with clear, cool water, then blot it dry with a clean cloth. This should remove the detergent along with the traces of cleaning product and stain it picked up.


If the last residual traces are persistent, you may need to blot several times. Alternatively, leave a few wet paper towels in the area, weight them down with a heavy object, and wait for them to dry."

, Take your studs and arrange them how you like over the leather bracelet. When you've gotten them just where you want them to be, gently poke the leather with the prongs from the stud. Doing this will not pierce the leather, but leave a small indent.

, Use the x-acto knife to cut small slits where the prongs indented the leather. These cuts need only be wide enough for the prongs to be inserted through; cutting them too wide will show up on the finished project.

, Slide each of the studs through the slits you have cut. The prongs will stick out the back end. Twist them around just how you like them before securing them in place.

, Flip the leather strip over and use your hammer to bend down the prongs. If there are two prongs on the back of each stud, hammer them down in opposite directions.

, To create the clasp, add the snap-on buttons to either end of the bracelet. These may have prongs that can be slid through the leather and hammered down like the studs, or they may need to be glued in place.

Compare the price.,
Look at the seller's feedback score.,
Read the description carefully.,
Look at the shipping fees.,
Message the seller if you have any questions.,
Don't click the ""Buy it Now"" or ""Place Bid"" button til you're sure.",How to Buy Things on eBay2," When buying an item on eBay, make sure that you have thoroughly researched the item before placing a bid. Look up the market value and search for similar items on auction and watch what prices they're selling for. This way, you will get a good idea of the going rate for a particular item, so you will recognize a genuinely good bargain when you see one. Take the time to do your research and make informed decisions before buying.Just imagine how angry you'd be if you rushed into purchasing a watch for $50 (thinking this was an excellent deal) only to see the same watch sell for $30 a week later.
Whatever you do, don't rush into a purchase just because you think it might be your only opportunity to buy - with the exception of very rare collectibles, most sale items will pop up again and again on eBay.

, Once of the most important things you need to consider before making a transaction on eBay is the feedback rating of the seller. The efficiency, openness and trustworthiness of the seller can make a huge impact on whether your buying experience on eBay is positive or negative. Each seller has a feedback score, which they receive based on the reviews of eBay customers who have previously bought items from them. This information is available on the description page of the item to be sold, in the top right hand corner.Whether the seller's feedback rating is good or poor should inform your decision to buy the item. If the rating is poor, you buy the item at your own risk. Though uncommon, it's possible that the seller may ship you a broken or faulty item, or fail to send the item at all.
You can also read reviews of each seller on their feedback page, written by previous buyers. This will also help to give you an idea of what you can expect when buying an item from them.

, To save time and hassle, it is important that you read the description of each item very, very carefully, to make sure it is exactly what you're looking for. Some pictures or titles may be deceiving (whether intentionally or otherwise) and you might be fooled into buying the wrong thing. Make sure to read the entire description thoroughly, looking out for any mentions of flaws or problems with the item.Remember that if you are disappointed with the condition of your item when it arrives, even though the flaws were clearly noted in the item's description, you will have no one to blame but yourself. In this situation it might be very difficult to arrange a return and the seller will not be happy.
Examples of things to watch out for include whether the item is new or used, whether it comes in its original packaging, and whether it includes any necessary extras (batteries, chargers etc.) Be wary of very vague or confusing descriptions, as there is an increased risk that the item will not be what you expect.

, Shipping fees are another expense you will need to factor in to the cost of buying things on eBay. It is very important to check the cost of shipping before you buy, as many buyers get caught out by very low selling prices which are balanced out by exorbitantly high shipping rates. For this reason, you always need to factor shipping costs in to the total price of your item. The shipping information should be stated clearly beneath the selling price of the item.If you are not satisfied with the shipping charge on the item, then you should not bid on it. It is very unfair on the seller to commit to buying the item, then refuse to pay high shipping charges. If you really wish to find a compromise, message the seller before agreeing to buy the item, to see if a solution can be found.
You also need to check what location the seller is shipping from and where they are willing to ship to. This is particularly important if you are buying from an international location, as some sellers will refuse to ship outside their own country. This information is available underneath the shipping costs.

, Good communication between the buyer and seller can transform any buying experience from poor to excellent. Most high-rated sellers will be very responsive towards any questions or queries you might have about the item itself, the shipping method and fees and the payment method.In order to message the seller, scroll down the item page until you reach the ""Question and Answers"" box beneath the item's description. There will be a link titled ""Ask a question"" which you can click on to message the seller.You should make sure that you have all of the correct information about the seller's preferred payment method and return policy before making a purchase. If this information is not supplied on the item page, ask the seller directly.

, What many new buyers don't realize is that by clicking on either the ""Buy it Now"" or ""Place Bid"" button, they are committing to purchasing the item and there is no going back. Once you hit either of these buttons, the seller is automatically charged a fee by eBay for their use of the site, so they will not be happy if you try to back out of the sale.In some cases, the situation can be resolved if you have a legitimate reason for backing out of the sale and you message the seller immediately requesting a cancellation. You may need to cover the cost of the fee they've already paid, but at least you won't be forced to buy an item you don't want.
If you do not have a legitimate reason for backing out of the sale and simply refuse to pay for the item, the seller is entitled to open a non-paying bidder dispute against you. This may result in an unpaid item strike being placed on your account, which will deter future sellers and buyers from wanting to do business with you. If you get three of these strikes, eBay will suspend your account."

Consider the potential legal consequences.,
Stop if you encounter a police officer.,
Get a new legal guardian.,
Emancipate yourself.",How to Run From an Abusive Home As a Teenager3," In most states, running away from home is not considered a crime. If you run away repeatedly, you may become under the supervision of juvenile court or family court. The legal system can provide services to your family or can punish (e.g. fines, drug testing, curfews, suspended driving privileges) you and your family.You also may have to go live with a family member or in a foster home.


It is illegal to run away in Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming if you are under the age of 18. If you do run away in one of these states, then you may be detained by the police, taken to a homeless shelter, or the police officer may try to take you back home.You may also be subject to penalties, such as suspension of your license, a curfew, or drug testing., If a police officer stops you, do not resist. If you resist, you could be charged with a crime or become injured. Tell the police that you have run away from home because of abuse. The police officer can report the abuse to child protective services, and they will conduct an investigation into your abuse allegations.The police may also take you to a shelter, crisis center, or Juvenile Hall to keep you safe. Be sure to tell the police that you are afraid to go home.
While some states do have criminal charges for children who run away from home, there are also services available to children who run away from home and for their families as well.Talking to a police office may help you to access these services, which is preferable to a life on the streets., Legal custody can be transferred from your parents to another adult over the age of 18. If you have a relative or an adult friend who is willing to become your legal guardian, this may be an option for you. Your parents do not have to agree with your decision. A judge can decide if this is the best option for you.The National Runaway Safeline can refer you to legal services to help you complete your paperwork and get information. These process can be very overwhelming and difficult to complete on your own.
You must file your guardianship paperwork at the courthouse and make an appointment to meet with he judge. Once you meet with the judge, the judge will decide if guardianship is best for you. Your parents will be notified that you have filed the papers.A legal guardian will assume all the rights and responsibilities that your parents had.
The process for filing papers varies by state.

, Emancipation is a good option if you already have a job, a place to live, and are able to support yourself. Once you become legally emancipated, you are given all of the rights and responsibilities of someone who is 18 years of age or older.You will have to file papers and go before a judge to plead your case. You must show the judge that you can take care of yourself and have good reason to seek emancipation.
Emancipation is permanent and there is no going back. Be sure this is what you want to do.
In most states, the minimum age for legal emancipation is 16, but in California children as young as 14 may be emancipated."

Watch the distant horizon or close your eyes.,
Get some fresh air.,
Stay distracted.,
Lie down.",How to Prevent Seasickness2," Motion sickness is most likely caused by the conflict of signals between your eyes and the balancing sensors in your inner ear.Watching the horizon in front of the boat gives you a steadier view. If that is not an option, close your eyes.


If the movement at the bow is too much for you, move back to the center of the boat.

, Stay above deck whenever possible, away from stuffy enclosed spaces and unpleasant smells. It's best to choose the lee of the boat (the side away from wind) in case you need to vomit.

, Start an activity before you start feeling sick, and continue it as long as you can. Help steer the boat if possible, as this helps you anticipate motion and requires you to focus on the horizon. If you are a passenger on a larger craft, distract yourself by counting birds and ships.Do not read or look at a screen. Focusing your eyes on a nearby point is terrible for seasickness.
Avoid others who are experiencing motion sickness, as the sight or smell of others being sick may bring on or worsen your own sea sickness., If nothing else works, lie down with your body parallel to the side of the boat, with your head pointed towards the bow. This reduces the sensation of motion and increases blood flow to the head, which can counteract the light-headed, dizzy feel some people experience.Keep your eyes closed unless there's a convenient view of the horizon.


A hammock helps reduce the sensation of side-to-side movement.
If you are in a bunk, wedge thick life jackets or other objects under the mattress to create a V-shape between the mattress and the wall. Lie in the narrow V so you are pinned against the wall, restricting your motion."

Attach paper and beads.,
Label your container with the lip balm.",How to Make a Lip Balm Container3," Make your bottle cap container look more decorative or a fun shape by using clay. Mold the clay to the cap and base in whatever shape you like.


Use colorful modeling clay like Sculpey clay or a similar brand to make your shapes. You can use tools like a plastic knife or toothpick to create designs or texture.
Mold your clay around your container so you know it will fit on after baking. Then pop the clay off and bake it according to the instructions for your specific variety of modeling clay.When the clay is hardened from the oven, let it cool. Then pop it back onto your container. Secure the clay pieces with glue if they don't stay on the container on their own.

, Glue on colorful paper, beads, glitter, or any other material you like to decorate your repurposed container or bottle cap container. Use Mod Podge or a similar craft material to add shine over your decorations.You can also use paint or pens to color directly on your container to make it a different color.
Try decorating your container with the same color as your lip balm, or an image of the lip balm’s flavor, scent, or other ingredients.

, Remember at a glance what kind of lip balm is in your container by creating a label for it. Write directly on the container with a pen or marker, or attach a piece of paper with the label.


Try printing out text from the computer for a typed label. Just make sure to measure your container first to create text that is the right size to attach to it.
Coat your label with Mod Podge or another shellac to make it shiny and look more seamless on a shiny container.

Learn the ABC's.,
Start a preliminary assessment once the patient is stabilized and breathing on his own.

,
Ensure that the femur is actually fractured from your assessment.,
Immobilize the patient and the fracture.,
Apply traction and maintain traction through the entire process.",How to Make a Preliminary Splint for a Fractured Femur," It takes something significant to break a femur bone in an otherwise healthy individual. That something would be of such force that the trauma alone is likely to have caused serious injury to the patient in other areas. It would not be uncommon for the patient to be unconscious, either from lateral injuries or from passing out in sheer pain.


Airway. The patient must have an open airway or all else is a moot point. If you have to breathe for the patient, it won't do any good if the air is not getting to the lungs. Use the head tilt, chin thrust method to make sure the airway is open to the lungs.
Breathing. Ensure that the victim is breathing, if not on her own, then you must breathe for her. She needs oxygen to survive. Even if she has a pulse, she will not for long if she is not breathing.
Circulation. Check for a pulse for about 10 seconds. Feel the carotid artery with two fingers while you are listening to breathing sounds from his mouth and watching his chest for rising and falling movements. If no pulse is found, start cardio pulmonary resuscitation immediately.;
,, You will feel crepitus, which is a definitive sign that there is a fracture; besides the fact that your patient will be in some of the worst pain imaginable.

, Though in pain, the patient must be kept still to prevent the pieces of bone from rubbing against each other or severing that artery.

, This is going to require an additional rescuer.


One person must grab the patient's heel, straighten out the leg and pull. It does not sound pleasant; however, the victim will feel instant relief when the bones are no longer rubbing, scraping or knocking against each other.
Find sticks, lumber, pipe; any kind of rigid material will do. It has to be long enough to reach from the groin area to well below the knee. Take belts, rope or anything you can find to tie the stick to the leg.
While maintaining traction, place the stick just under the groin or crotch and under the back of the knee. Take the belts and secure the leg to the stick above and below the site of the break. You might need more ties above and below to ensure that the leg is immobilized completely. Check pulse at the knee frequently to ensure proper circulation. Make sure the victim can feel sensation in the feet as well.

Manage your allergies.Allergies can cause severe eye puffiness.,
Treat your skin more gently.,
Visit a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Bags Under Eyes Without Plastic Surgery3," Avoid allergens whenever possible and if you suffer from seasonal allergies, take an over-the-counter antihistamine every morning. After about two weeks, you’ll notice that your eye bags and under eye puffiness have diminished.Try using a neti pot to flush out excess moisture from your sinuses caused by allergies, colds, or infections.
Speak with your doctor about prescription allergy medication if over-the-counter medications doesn’t help.
A doctor can also help you develop prevention strategies and will thoroughly investigate the source of your allergies., Avoiding rubbing your eyes during the day, which can irritate them.

Make a list of things that scare you.,
Start with smaller fears.,
Break bigger fears into smaller steps.,
Create a list of daily actions.,
Get help doing a task from someone you trust.,
Take the challenge with a friend or family member.,
Keep a journal to track your actions.",How to Do One Thing That Scares You Every Day1," Create an anxiety diary. Anxiety diaries can be an effective tool for overcoming fears. Grab a notepad and paper, and set aside some time for self-contemplation free from distractions. Relax, let your thoughts wander freely, think of things that scare you, and write them in your pad. You might think of a few things immediately, but if you give yourself enough time, you might come up with things you hadn't expected.For example, you might immediately write down public speaking and introducing yourself to new people. After some deep introspection, you might realize that both are connected to being afraid of looking foolish or of being rejected.
Try to keep your diary with you as much as you can to write down your fear or anxiety as it occurs. As you write down the fear, also record when it happened, and how it made you feel.
Take a few minutes in the evenings to review and reflect on what you have written. Then, identify some small achievable goals to help you face and overcome these fears in the future.
Create a list of healthy coping skills that help you when you are faced with fear, such as listening to music, talking with someone you trust, and meditating.;
, Try not to avoid your fears. If you avoid things, you’ll likely be missing out on important things in life that you want or need to do. For example, you may have to give a certain amount of presentations at work before you're considered for a promotion, but you may have a terrifying fear of speaking in public. You’ll likely come up with several simpler fears that you can attack with easy actions, like being afraid to try new foods. If you start with smaller, more actionable fears, you'll be more likely to commit to doing something that scares you every day.


For instance, if you’re afraid to try eating fish, it’s relatively simple to go to a restaurant and order a grilled salmon salad.
If you are afraid of public speaking. Take a public speaking class. If you're not ready for that step, start small and join a special interest group, such as a small book club with people you don't know. These groups usually are held in small, intimate settings.
If you're afraid of lakes or oceans because you cannot see what is underneath you. Start small and just try going out onto a boat until you are comfortable. When you're able to go further, get onto a raft. Take your time. Don't rush. If it takes a few times to go from one to another, then that is okay. Listen to your own intuitive instincts, but also try to utilize some healthy coping skills to help you work through your fears. Eventually, maybe you can dip a toe in, or maybe a foot.

, Your other fears might be larger and more complex. Break those complex fears up into smaller actionable steps so they’re not so overwhelming.For example, suppose you’re afraid to ride a bike. It might seem like an overwhelming fear at first, but you can solve it using clear steps: ask someone you trust to help you learn, use training wheels, and start riding on grass before pavement.

, Making a plan ahead of time will help you purposefully put yourself in situations out of your comfort zone. Set clear expectations and hold yourself accountable for completing particular daily actions. Organize your plan using specific dates and times and give yourself a clear path to achieving your goals.For example, start planning your week out Sunday night. Write specific actions such as, “Monday: I will call John and try to resolve our disagreement. Tuesday: I will introduce myself to someone new and have a conversation with them. Wednesday: I will go out for lunch and try sushi for the first time. Thursday: I will start my new group workout class. Friday: I will participate in my weekly team meeting and bring up my new product design idea.”

, Reach out to a trusted friend or family member who’s good at a task that you’re afraid to try. For example, if you’re afraid to ride a bike or drive a car, think of someone you know and trust who’s a great bike rider or driver.


Tell them, “Hey, you’re a great driver. I have a license, but haven’t driven in a while and I’ve been afraid to get back on the road on my own. Do you think you have time two or three times a week to show me some pointers?”

, In addition to helping you learn a task that scares you, a buddy can help you stick to your challenge. Make a pact with someone close to you and agree that you'll both do something scary every day. Spend time together once a week making your lists, then have a chat at the end of each day to talk about what you did.


If you or your buddy feel like backing out of a day's action, you could call each other to provide motivation.
If you can't find someone to take the challenge with you, ask a friend or family member for support and to hold you accountable. You'll be more likely to complete your daily challenges if you have someone to pump you up and tell you to stick to your goals.

, Set aside about 20 minutes a day to write about what you did that day that scared you. Write down how you felt before you did the action, what you did, and how you felt afterward.You can look back on your experiences and use them as examples to help you do things that scare you in the future. For example, you might have written, “Today I finally worked up the courage to talk to Sam. I was really nervous at first and could feel my heart racing! It turned out to be easy, though. I don't know why I was scared in the first place!”

Prep your hair.,
Start with a small section.Grab a piece of your hair from one side your part, near the part itself.,
Split this section into thirds.,
Begin braiding.,
Start bringing in new hair.,
Continue braiding around your head.,
Finish your braid.",How to French Braid2," Just like you did for the normal French braid, brush through tangles to smooth out your hair. French lace braids can work down either one or both sides of your head, so need to part your hair. Use a center or side part, depending on what look you prefer.








, The size of this section does matter in French lace, as it determines the thickness of the braid. For a larger braid, grab a hefty section of hair, and for a dainty braid, grab a smaller piece. In general, it should be about one inch thick.








, As with the normal French braid, you need to divide your starting section of hair into three even pieces. Angle these pieces downward to frame your face, rather than pulling them toward the back of your head.







, Start the French lace in a traditional braid. Cross the ""right"" strand over to center, then cross the ""left"" strand over to center.








, In the French braid, you added hair from both sides of your head. In the French lace braid, you should only add hair from one side of the braid.








It doesn't matter which side you add new hair from. The important thing is that all new hair comes from the same side of the braid.

, As you move further along with your braid, it will start to form a crown or halo shape around your head. You can choose to braid over the top of your ear, or under it.









If you are making a single braid, wrap it all the way around your head. You will likely run out of hair near the ear on the other side of your head.
If you're making two braids, stop braiding when you reach the nape of your neck. Tie off the first braid with an elastic, then repeat the entire process on the other side of your head to create your second braid.

, Eventually, you will run out of loose hair to work into the braid. At this point, keep working in a traditional braid until you reach the ends of your strands. Tie off your hair with an elastic tie to secure your French lace braid.

Use essential oils to make your own room spray.,
Sprinkle essential oil on cushions and pillows.,
Make an essential oil cleaning spray.,

Look for other ways to use essential oils to freshen your home.",How to Use Essential Oils4," Put a few teaspoons of water in the bowl on top of the diffuser. Light the candle under the diffuser and then sprinkle a few drops of your chosen essential oil into the water. The scent of the oil will waft gently around the room.


You can also use a reed diffuser to disperse the scent of the essential oil., Light a candle and wait a minute or two to allow a small amount of wax to melt. Blow out the candle and add a couple of drops of essential oil to the melted wax, before carefully relighting the candle. Take care not to drop any oil on the wick as essential oils are highly flammable.

, If you don’t have a diffuser or candles handy, you can just fill a small bowl or saucer with boiling water and then add a few drops of essential oil. The steam will waft the aroma of the oil around the room. Just make sure that you place the dish somewhere out of reach of pets and children.

, Fill a small spray bottle with 2 ounces of distilled water and 2 ounces of vodka or witch hazel. Then add 30-40 drops of your favorite essential oil (or a blend of two or more oils) and shake well. Spray this essential oil room spray into the air and onto furniture and linens, but take care to avoid polished surfaces., Sprinkle two drops of essential oil onto the cushions in your living space and your pillows. You will enjoy the aroma of the essential oils every time you sit or lay your head down. If you are worried about damaging the fabric, put the essential oil drops on cotton balls and place them inside the covers of your cushions and pillowcases.

, Since essential oils have antibacterial properties, they can be used to create natural multi-purpose cleaning sprays. You can use these sprays to clean non-porous surfaces such as tile, glass, and plastic. In a spray bottle, combine the following ingredients and shake well.1/2 cup of white vinegar or witch hazel
1/2 cup of water
15-20 drops of an essential oil of your choice (tea tree, lavender, lemon, and peppermint are good choices)
a few drops of dish soap (optional)

, Cut up an old cotton t-shirt into 5” squares. Every time you dry a load of laundry, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a t-shirt square and toss it into the dryer with your wet clothes. Then run the dryer as usual.

Add any finishing touches.",How to Sculpt a Face," You have several options when choosing a modelling clay to sculpt your face. Each clay is different, so choose the clay that best suits your purposes.Ceramic clays are water-based and easy to work with right out of the bag. It needs to stay moist while being worked, as it can dry out and crack. Ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture.Plasteline clay is an oil-based clay that doesn't dry out, and can't be fire hardened. It is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail.Polymer clays require an armature, or a wire skeleton, for support. They are weaker than other clays, but are good for painting. Polymer clays can be fire hardened, though they are not as hard as ceramic clays.;
, Aside from the clay, you'll need a few other things before you can start sculpting. A good, clean working area is necessary, as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture. You can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores.


You don't have to buy specialized tools for sculpting. It may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose. The main functions of your tools are to cut, scrape, and shape the clay.You can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay, and add detail., If you know the person whose face you are sculpting, take pictures of them from all angles. Try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera. Take some from the side as well to get a good profile.If you're basing your sculpture on a famous person, find photos on the internet and print them out. Make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person's proportions.It may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features., Think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture. Think about who they are, what they do, and why you want to sculpt them. Use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture. Do a rough drawing of different expressions to get some ideas for how you want your sculpture to look.The drawing doesn't have to be perfect. It's just a tool to help you plot out your sculpture.

, Roll out an oval and smooth the clay. The smoother you can make your clay in the beginning, the easier it will be to form your face.Depending on the size of your sculpture, it may be difficult to roll out a ball. If you're making a small sculpture, it shouldn't be a problem. However, if you're making a larger sculpture, you may need to sculpt out a neck as well.Keep in mind the proportions of your subject as you form the oval. You'll be adding clay to make the other facial features, but the oval should resemble the basic shape of your subject's head., An alternate method to making the basic shape of a face is to create a silhouette based on your subject's profile.Print out a profile photo of your subject. Make sure the photo is the size you want your sculpture to be.Roll out some clay about as wide as you'd like the nose on your sculpture to be. Lay it flat on a clean surface. Make sure you have enough clay make a full profile.Take the profile cut out and lay it on your slab of clay. Trace the profile onto the clay and cut away any excess clay.This should leave you with a slab of clay that is a silhouette of your subject. Start adding some clay to thicken the neck so you can stand your sculpture up as you add width to form the face., Using a needle or a rubber-tipped tool, draw a fine vertical line down the middle of the face. This is your line of symmetry. Draw a horizontal line halfway down your line of symmetry to mark where the eyes will be.Halfway between the eye-line and the bottom of the face, make a second horizontal line. This is where you will place the nose.Make one last line halfway between the nose-line and the bottom of the face to mark where the mouth will go., Using a small spoon or rounded tool, start forming the eye sockets just under the eye-line. Take care not to gouge the clay.Work carefully and take your time. Try to keep your tool flat on the clay and use small circular movements. Smooth the clay out as you work. The sockets should be deep enough so that the eyes do not protrude from the sculpture.Add brow bones by rolling two small cylinders of clay and attaching them just above the eye sockets. Make sure the clay is workable so you can blend it onto the face. Using a small spatula, slowly work the brow bone into the forehead creating a small ridge. Work until you can't see any creases between the forehead and the brow bone.Form eyelids in much the same way as you made brow bones. Take two small cylinders of clay and place them just under the brow bone and into the eye sockets. Smooth out any seam lines to blend the eyelids into the rest of the face. Repeat the process to form the bottom eyelids.Roll small balls of clay to place into the eye sockets to act as the eyes. Round off the ball and form each eye in its socket. Try to keep the eyes symmetrical as you form them., Form a pyramid from a separate piece of clay and attach it between the eyes. Blend the clay into the face, paying special attention to the bridge of the nose. The bridge should blend evenly with the brow-bones.As you make the nose check the profile of your sculpture. Some noses stick out further than others, and some turn up slightly. Refer to your photo reference to make sure you get the nose just right.The shape of a nose lends character to a face. Play around with different types of noses to see what effects you can create., To make a mouth on your sculpture, scoop out a little clay below the nose. Only take enough clay to form the inside of the mouth. You'll be adding lips to your face with separate pieces of clay.Using the same technique as you did to form the brow bone and the nose, add some clay to form the lips. Roll out a small cylinder and blend it into the face to form the upper lip.
Forming a mouth takes a lot of practice. Keep referring to your photo reference and don't be afraid to start over if you need to.To form the bottom lip, leave some excess clay from the upper lip and bend it down, forming a horseshoe shape. Roll another cylinder of clay and attach it beneath the upper lip. Leave a little space between the two lips to make it appear as though the mouth is slightly open. Blend the clay until all the seams are gone., Once you've added eyes, a nose, and a mouth, you might need to go back and build out the rest of the face. Add clay to make a chin, cheeks, hair, or even bulk up the forehead if you need to.When adding clay to your face, make sure you keep blending to make a seamless sculpture. It helps to work the clay a little to warm it up. This way it's easier to mold when you add it.Add ears by making small flat circles and attaching them to the side of the face. Keep the earlobe above the jawline, and connect the top part of the ear on the same path as the eye-line. Sculpt the details of the ear with a small spatula or needle., Before you finish your sculpture, compare it to your photo reference. If you find anything you aren't happy with, go back and re-work it. Stay patient and think of your mistakes as opportunities to improve your skill.Once you're happy with everything, do a final blending pass over your sculpted face. Smooth out any seams, remove any excess clay, and clean up the sculpture., Depending on the clay you used, you can either bake it off to finish your sculpture, or form a mold.Feel free to paint your sculpture, or add decorations to bring your art to life."

Don’t punish your dog after it has misbehaved.,
Teach your dog good indoors manners.",How to Bring up a Gentle and Pleasant Dog," Although any breed of dog can have a kind disposition and be inclined towards gentleness, different breeds have different behavioral dispositions due to breeding and genetic traits.Research breeds online or by talking with informed individuals at pet stores or veterinary clinics in your area. Dog breeds that have gentle dispositions include: Great Danes, Beagles, Newfoundlands, and Pugs.


Consider what you want in a dog: would you prefer a lazy, mellow pet, or a dog that is athletic and high-energy?
If you’re set on getting a purebred animal, look into the breed’s history. If you’re looking for a gentle pet, avoid dogs that have been bred for violent activities such as guarding or animal hunting.;
, To ensure that you find a gentle and pleasant dog, opt for a dog whose breed is considered friendly and easy-going. Breeds known to be high-strung, or which require excessive training or high maintenance, may not develop into the gentle dog you’re looking for. A few outgoing, fun-loving breeds are: Irish Setters, Beagles, Boxers, and Welsh Corgis/Breeds that are commonly considered affectionate include: golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, Irish wolfhounds, Collies, English bulldogs, and Great Danes., Aside from breed characteristics, you want to do everything possible to ensure that your specific dog is an affectionate, gentle, and pleasant pet.If possible, spend some time with a potential pet before you bring it home. This is especially important if you’re adopting a grown animal from a pet shelter, since adult dogs will be less likely to change their behavior in a new home.


If you’re bringing home a puppy, you should still try to spend time with it before the adoption to make sure that it’s gentle.
If you have your choice of a number of puppies (an entire litter, for example), spend time with the puppies and choose one that seems outgoing and personable., Rather than punishing your dog for mistakes they have made, which will teach your dog to fear you, positively reinforce their good behaviors. When your dog obeys a command or completes a task correctly, praise your dog and give them a treat or piece of food.Taking your dog to an obedience training course is a great way to have your dog trained quickly and effectively. Make sure that the training instructors themselves use positive reinforcement, and other gentle training methods.

, To ensure that your dog will along well with other dogs and other humans (the dogs’ owners) and will have a pleasant disposition, avoid secluding your dog.Let it interact with other animals and humans frequently, and always in a safe space where your dog won’t feel threatened or uncomfortable. These interactions will help your dog develop social relationships and healthy interactions with humans and other dogs.


One way to socialize a new dog—especially a puppy—is to have a “puppy party.” Invite various friends, especially people who are calm and enjoy being around dogs.You can also invite other dog-owners to bring their dogs over to meet yours, or agree to meet at a dog park to let the dogs run together., Dogs can be remarkably unpleasant when they walk improperly on a leash and refuse to walk with their owner, or drag their owner along behind them. Make the walk walk by your side, and don’t let it pull on the leash.


If your dog gets excited or aggressive when another dog is near, continue your walk. If you give in and let your dog approach the strange dog, your dog with this this behavior is acceptable.

, Although roughhousing and play-biting can seem cute and affectionate when your dog is a puppy, as the dog matures, this behavior becomes unpleasant and can even be painful. Prevent your dog from biting by pulling back or yelling “Ouch!” when it play-bites. Move away from your puppy for a couple of minutes. When you return, resume gently playing.This behavior mimics the way that puppies learn to tussle and play with one another in their litters.
Preventing your dog from biting will let it know how to behave gently.

, If you play a game—fetch, for example—and repeatedly tease your dog, you run the risk of teaching it that playtime is unpleasant and should be avoided. This can diminish the bond between dog and owner, and will result in a less gentle adult dog.


Avoid playing other rough games with your dog. Even a game like tug-of-war can teach your dog that it’s OK to take things away from humans, and that ripping objects out of your grasp is appropriate.

, After-the-fact punishment has been shown to work ineffectively.For example, it’s not helpful to yell at your dog after it has broken a household object or gone to the bathroom inside, unless you catch it in the act of misbehaving. Instead, use training and positive reinforcement to teach your dog proper indoor behavior. Then, when the dog does something good, praise it with a treat and by showing it attention.


Punishing your dog after misbehavior can be counterproductive, as many dogs will take the attention being lavished on them as a positive sign.Dogs often feel as though any attention is good attention, and may be more inclined to misbehave if they think it will get your attention.

, A well-trained, well-behaved dog will be a pleasant and gentle companion and friend. Teach the dog to behave well inside the house from an early age, and you’ll have fewer instances of disobedience and unpleasant behavior. If your dog clearly knows your behavioral expectations, it will behave well and be a pleasant pet.


Don’t let your dog jump up on friends or visitors.
When you are feeding the dog, give it food after you’ve already eaten. If the dog is begging and whining while you are preparing its meal, say something like “leave me alone” in a firm voice. When the dog leaves you alone and the meal is prepared, then you can feed it.

Clean the squash.,
Submerge the squash in water.,
Simmer the squash for two to three minutes.,
Cut off the ends of the top and bottom of the squash.,
Peel the squash.,
Cut the squash in half.,
Remove the seeds.,
Cut the halves of the squash lengthwise.,
Make sure your squash is stable.,
Pick the right sized knife.,
Bake a squash first if it's very tough.",How to Cut Winter Squash," Before you prepare any food to eat, you should always wash it. Place your squash under running tap water. Turn the squash as necessary to get the full surface cleaned off, rubbing off dirt and grime as necessary. You will be submerging the squash in water after this, so there's no need to dry it., You will need a pot or a pan large enough to submerge the full squash. Place the squash in the pan and fill it with water. This is to see how much water you will need.Allow the water to boil. You should actually remove the squash here, as you don't want to boil it.
Once the water is boiling, you can place the squash back in the pot or pan.

, Reduce the heat on the stove to a simmer as soon as you place the squash in the pan. Allow the squash to simmer for about two to three minutes before removing it from the pot or pan.Make sure to be careful when removing the squash. Use tongs or spoons to lift it from the pan. Do not use your bare hands.
Sometimes, some of the water evaporates during the boiling process. If the squash is not fully submerged in the water, simmer one side for two to three minutes, flip the squash, and simmer for an additional two to three minutes.

, You do not need the bottom or the stem-end of the squash. These parts are not used for cooking. Use a very sharp knife here, as this will cut the squash most easily. Cut an even slice 1/4 of an inch from the top and the bottom of the squash.Your squash will probably still be hot after your remove it from the water. Either use gloves to handle the squash or let it cool for a few minutes before cutting it.

, Take a vegetable peeler and run it along the sides of the squash. The hot water will make the squash's skin come off easily. Running the peeler from the top of the squash to the bottom, peel the squash until you remove all the skin.Check your recipe before peeling the squash, however. Some recipes require you keep the skin on.
You should still let the squash simmer in boiling water, even if you're not peeling it. Squashes are much easier to cut after being softened by warm water.

, Take a sharpened chef's knife and a cutting board. Stand the squash up on the cutting board, with one of the two chopped ends seated on the board. Usually, the non-stem end is a bit wider, and easier to set down on the cutting board. Slice down the middle of the squash, cutting it into two halves of roughly the same size and shape.Make sure to go slowly and have a firm grip on the squash. You do not want to accidentally harm yourself.

, Once the squash is cut in half, you will notice two small semi-circles on either half. These semi-circles will be filled with seeds. Take a spoon and scoop out the seeds. You do not need them when you cook the squash.Many people roast squash seeds, much like they roast pumpkins seeds, so set the seeds aside if you plan on roasting them.

, Lay down each side of the squash on the cutting board. Start with one section. Cut the section in half lengthwise, and then slice the two new halves into long, thin slices. Repeat with the other side. You should be left with a pile of long slices of squash, about half an inch wide. Many recipes require or recommend cubed squash slices. If your recipe calls for this, cut each slice of squash into small cubes., Always work on a stable surface. If your squash slips out of your hand while you're cutting it, you could easily cut your hand with a knife. Place your cutting board on a level surface. It can also help to place a damp towel below the cutting board, as this will help hold it in place., Make sure the blade of the knife is roughly as long as your squash. Trying to cut a squash with a short, stubby knife will be ineffective and increases the likelihood of kitchen accidents.You should also avoid serrated knives, like bread knives, when cutting squash. You want to be able to make quick, clean slices.

, Some squash are easier to cut than others. If you're working with a squash that's very thick and difficult to cut, don't strain yourself trying. This increases the likelihood of the knife slipping from your hands. Instead of pushing yourself too hard, pop the squash in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit and leave it alone for 10 minutes. When you remove the squash from the oven, it should be much easier to cut.Make sure to let the squash cool for a few minutes before handling it when you remove it from the oven.

Put your arm around her while you're sitting next to her.,
Sit next to her.,
Make the move.,
Consider yawning for effect.",How to Hug Your Girlfriend2," This is a classic early-relationship move. If she's open to a hug, she's probably open to this.


You can try this any time that you're sitting next to her for longer than a few minutes. Consider putting your arm around her during a movie, a concert, a school play, in the backseat of a car, or on a ferris wheel.
Make sure that the seat you're sitting in has a back-side to rest your arm on. Couches are great for this.
Consider picking a time when there aren't many other people around. She may feel self-conscious if a lot of her friends, or yours, see you make your move. If the lights are low--say, you're watching a movie, or it's dark outside--she may feel more comfortable.

, Sit close enough that you can reach around to her far shoulder--anywhere from a few inches to a foot apart.


Wait until you've been sitting next to each other for at least 5-10 minutes. She should be comfortable, and you should be comfortable.
Wait for the right moment: maybe there's a romantic scene taking place in the movie, or maybe it's a slow, cinematic scene when there's no dialogue and the music swells. Avoid making your move during an especially tense moment, such as a chase scene or a scene with complex dialogue. When you put your arm around her, the movie is the last thing that she'll be thinking about, and she might be irritated if you make her miss something important.

, Lift your arm slowly but purposely and reach behind her. Lay your arm against the back of the couch or seat, and gently rest your arm along the ridge of her shoulders.


Play it cool. Be casual and nonchalant. If she doesn't shake your arm away, there's a good chance that she's into it. Leave your arm where it is and keep watching the show.
Keep acting the same way that you were doing before, but feel about ten times cooler.
If she shrugs your arm away or moves your arm off of her shoulder, don't push it. She isn't in the mood, or she isn't interested. Keep your cool and keep watching the show.

, This is a classic ""excuse"" to lift your arms up and make the move.


Take a big, theatrical yawn, reach your arms high into the air, and lay one arm down on her shoulders. Rest your arm there unless she shrugs you away.
The yawn is a cheesy move, to be sure, but it might make her laugh and break the tension of the moment.

Create beer can creature wall art.,
Give your betrothed a bouquet of beer can flowers.,
Design beer can model transportation.,
Go for the gusto and create a full size beer can sculpture.",How to Make Beer Can Artwork," Whether you need to fill wall space in the den or want to simply display your affinity for beer, create creatures using an empty beer can.

Plot what creature you plan to make. During the planning phase you will also need to consider how many beer cans and extra accessories (i.e. crafting features, google eyes etc.) it might take to create your design.
Consider how you will morph the beer can to accommodate each area of the creature. What kind of tools will you need to create your creature? Perhaps you’ll need strong scissors, a brick to pound out the can and possibly a pair of work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges.
Assemble and bond your creature together using either liquid nails or a staple gun. Lay out your pieces first before gluing them together. You may see other ways to design your creature as you lay it out versus what you’ve sketched on paper.;
, Why be ordinary and give your honey a bouquet of fresh flowers when you can create one, two or even an entire array of flowers from beer cans? They won’t wilt or die like fresh, plus they can symbolize a drink you both enjoy.

Cut off the top of the can. You won’t need the top so remove it first. Make a clean cut using either a pair of sharp scissors or a well sharpened knife. Be very careful not to cut your fingers.
Create the flower petals by cutting elongated oval shapes down the sides of the can. You may need multiple cans to create the petals.
Cut off the bottom of the can to be used as the middle of the flower. Pound out the can’s middle so it is smooth and round, removing any ridges or edges.
Create leaves by cutting out small elongated ovals from the sides of other beer cans. Use a stick or even a green ballpoint pen to etch veins into the leaves.
Find a stick in the yard or use a smooth crafting stick from the hobby store to act at the flower’s stem. Place a dab of glue on the back of your flower middle (the bottom of the can) and hold one end of the stick to the glue until it is fully bonded.
Add flower petals around the edges of your flower. Consider alternating sizes and label designs. You could have one side facing up donning the beer can label and the next could be the silver backside.
Glue leaves down the sides of the stick. Affix the leaves to the backside of the stick area and hold until bonded.

, Create model airplanes, trains and automobiles using beer can art. Because cans are so pliable you can mold and shape the beer cans to accommodate a variety of designs such as wheels, engines and airplane wings.

Create a blueprint for what you want to design. Approach your model car or plane the same way you would if you were to build it from any other material. Break down each section/piece and list what you will need (i.e. four wheels, the car body, the front dash etc.). Sketch out a rough design on paper for a better idea of what your design will become.
Gather supplies, which may include additional pieces such as a model propeller or wire that you could use to hang an airplane or helicopter.
Break down your beer cans and prepare for assembly. For example, you can make wheels from the bottoms of the can, the body from an entire can and/or wings or fins from cutting out the sides of a can. This is where you’ll need to truly use your imagination to build your vehicle.
Assemble the vehicle. In some cases you can slide cans together and press them together, however in most situations you’ll need some heavy duty Super Glue or liquid nails for adhesion.

, The sky is the limit when it comes to crafting with beer cans. Is there something missing in the front yard that perhaps a life size beer can sculpture could fix? Depending on the amount of beer you drink, you could design something that was take the neighbor’s breath away.

Consider the statement you want to make and where you’d like to maintain the sculpture. Would a sculpture of an eagle or a large cactus compliment your way of living or something more modern and Remember, cans will eventually rust so you’ll probably want to either maintain your sculpture indoors or underneath a covered patio.
Sketch out what you’d like to build. Perhaps it's a replica of the Eiffel Tower or a woodland creature; use a sketchpad to map out how your figure will look.
Gather supplies. If you are planning to create something big, you may need to tap into local college kids’ beer can supply as you will need hundreds upon hundreds of cans. Otherwise create your sculpture with the supply you currently maintain and then add any other pieces that will be vital to your sculpture.
Map out your location. Make sure your sculpture’s home is free and clear (as well as available to receive your sculpture). Consider cleaning off table tops or the floor to ensure you don't have dirt or grime forever trapped underneath your sculpture.
Create your masterpiece. Put creativity to the test by building the image you have in your mind and on paper. Make it permanent by using glue to adhere pieces together and build it from the ground up.

It will get stuck and just cause damage. Try a trumpet or clarinet-style pull through instead. Use a mouthpiece brush to clean out your mouthpiece just now as well - no point in blowing all your mouthpiece gunk down into your nice clean horn!

, Now for the nasty bit. When bath-time is almost up, put your pull-through through your lead-pipe (from mouthpiece end to tuning slide) and then use either the end of your pull-through or a similar smaller brush to clean out all the valve-slides.

, You should be able to hear any water sloshing around inside but if you are having trouble getting it out try depressing all the valves and tipping the horn round 360 degrees towards the bell - any water should come out of the bell!

, After making sure you have gotten rid of any water sitting in the valves, lay your horn on some towels or another clean sheet to dry. Remove any surface water with a clean cloth or towel and then leave the horn, preferably in a room with some circulating air for a few hours to dry out.

Not only will you look happier performing if you love a song, you're less likely to slip up. If you really love a piece of music, you've probably listened to it over and over again. You're more likely to recall how to move your lips properly.Having a vested interest in what you're learning makes memorization easier. For example, even people who are bad with names can easily remember the names of people they find attractive. If you choose a song that interests you personally, you're more likely to retain information like lyrics and timing.;
, The first step to learning to lip sync is to memorize the lyrics you want to lip sync to. You can usually find lyrics online if you can't make out the precise words.


Try singing along to the song a few times with the music playing before attempting to lip synch.
Write out the lyrics over and over again. Actively pay attention to the words you're writing as you go. Memorization of material improves through writing. Write the lyrics 5 to 10 times, paying close attention to each word you're writing down on the page.Remember, oftentimes when lip syncing you may find it looks more authentic to sing the words quietly as you go along. Having the words committed to memory can really help you lip syncing go over well.

, Practice singing along to the song in front of a mirror. Watch how your lips move. See if they're in sync with the song. You may find that you need to slightly exaggerate the movements of your lips and mouth to make it look like you're singing.


It can help to sing softly while the song is playing. Do not sing loud enough that your voice overpowers the recording. However, quietly singing the words can help your lip syncing look more accurate.
In addition to remember the lyrics, timing is key. Try to keep track of musical interludes and how long they last. Try to count in your head to measure about when you'll need to start singing again.
It might help to record yourself singing and then play it back. You can re-watch your performances and see where there's room for improvement.

, In addition to the singing itself, costumes and dance moves can add a lot to your musical routine. Not only do audiences enjoy people who are uninhibited on stage, a great costume and dance can prove a distraction if you do slip up lip syncing wise. Have fun and be creative. However, keep in mind your comfort is also key. If a certain dance move or costume makes you feel insecure, your audience will pick up on that. Only select outfits and dance moves that feel organic to your personality., Lip syncing successfully is not all about successfully mimicking lyrics. Personality plays a big role in performance. Allow your unique personality to show through on stage.


If you tend to be a comedic type, go for funny. Wear a goofy outfit. Use intentionally awkward dance moves. Pick a song that's lighthearted and fun.
If you're a more reserved type, try choosing a more serious song. Try to convey your emotional connection by maintaining a reserved attitude during your performance.

, If you're lip syncing in front of a crowd, pick a specific person and act as though you are lip syncing just to her. This can help make your performance more intense., If you want to master a new skill, you need a guide. Oftentimes, the best way to learn a skill is by simply watching. Look up videos of lip syncing online or attend a lip syncing battle in your area.


Pay attention all aspects of performance. Writers who want to be better writers read and pay attention to things like sentence structure, story, and dialogue. If you want to learn to lip sync, watch for performance persona, timing, and accuracy.If at all possible, ask questions. Questions about the nuances of performance can be a great way to learn more. If you're able to attend a lip sync contest, consider stopping a performer afterwards and asking him or her any questions you may have., There are no quick ways to master a new skill. You simply have to make time every day to practice and, with time, you will improve.Keep a consistent schedule. Practicing lip syncing should become as natural to you as brushing your teeth at night. Set aside a half or so to go over your chosen song a few times.

, There are different kinds of learners. Some people learn best by watching, reading, and studying. Others learn best by seeing and doing. In order to master lip syncing, understand and practice your personal learning style. There are many tests online you can use to gauge how you learn best., You progress is unlikely to be steady the entire time. When mastering a new skill, people usually make a lot of initial progress and then plateau. This often leads to frustration and people end up quitting. Have patience and be consistent. If you continue to practice each day, you will eventually surpass your plateau.

Pay attention to the positions of pieces that do not move.",How to Play Stratego," Each Stratego set comes with a 10X10 board to play on. The board is large enough to accommodate both players' armies plus non-moving pieces. The board has two 2X2 lake areas on it that pieces cannot move through and that act as the barrier space when you first set up the game. Do not place any pieces on or near these spots when you set up the game. Keep the two center rows of the board empty until the game has started., Each Stratego game comes with two sets of army pieces (one red and one blue). Each army has 33 army pieces and every piece is ranked from 1-10 (1 is the lowest rank and 10 is the highest rank). Each set also includes 6 Bombs and 1 Flag, but these pieces are not ranked and they do not move. Only the army pieces may move and attack. Each army set includes: 10: 1 Marshall

9: 1 General

8: 2 Colonels

7: 3 Majors

6: 4 Captains

5: 4 Lieutenants

4: 4 Sergeants

3: 5 Miners

2: 8 Scouts

1: 1 Spy

, Since there are two sets, you and your opponent will each have to choose a color before you can set up the game. Try choosing at random by holding two different color pieces in each hand (so your opponent cannot see them) and ask your opponent to choose one. Whatever color your opponent chooses will be his or her color for the game., Before you set you your army pieces, you will need to set up the fortress screen to prevent your opponent from seeing how you are positioning your pieces. Do not remove the fortress screen from the board until you and your opponent have finished setting up the board., As you set up your pieces, make sure that they are facing you and not your opponent. Your opponent should not be able to see the types of your pieces and you should not be able to see the types of your opponent’s pieces. After you have set up your pieces, you are ready to play., During each of your turns, you may either move or attack an opponent’s piece. You may not do both. If you find yourself in a position where you cannot move or attack, then you have lost the game and must announce your defeat to your opponent., Take turns moving your pieces in vertical or horizontal directions. Pieces may not move in a diagonal direction. Pieces may only move one space, except for the Scouts which can move an unlimited distance. Just keep in mind that because only scouts can move more than one space per turn, moving a scout more than one space will reveal its identity to your opponent and may cause your opponent to attack that piece.Pieces cannot jump over the lake or over other pieces. They also may not occupy the same space as another piece.Pieces cannot move back and forth between the same two spaces over three consecutive turns.

, Attack your opponent’s pieces to reduce his or her numbers and capture your opponent’s Flag. You may only attack pieces that are directly next to your pieces. They may not be a space away or diagonal to one of your pieces. They must be right next to each other in a vertical or horizontal direction.When you attack your opponent (or your opponent attacks you) you must both announce the rank of your piece that attacked (or was attacked). Whatever piece has the highest ranking wins the fight. Remove the losing piece from the board. If both pieces have the same rank, then remove both pieces from the board.
Place captured pieces in the tray as you play. Doing so will help to keep them organized for future games.
Place the winning piece on the space that was occupied by the losing piece., Some pieces have special attack privileges that make them capable of attacking more powerful pieces. Make sure that you observe these special attack privileges as you play the game.The Spy can capture the Marshal if the Spy attacks first. If the Spy is attacked by the Marshal, then the Spy is captured instead.
Scouts can move and attack on the same turn. No other pieces can do both in the same turn
Miners can disarm Bomb pieces. All other pieces must be removed from the board if they attack a Bomb piece.

, Whoever captures his or her opponent’s Flag first wins the game. But you may also win the game if your opponent reaches a point where he or she cannot make any more moves. For example, if all of the player’s moveable pieces have been captured or blocked, then that player would lose the game., A common strategy in Stratego is to surround one’s Flag with Bomb pieces to prevent players from accessing it. However, this strategy may fail if your opponent uses a miner to defuse these Bombs and then captures your Flag. If you do surround your Flag with Bombs, make sure that you have some high ranking, moveable pieces nearby to take out any approaching pieces., Since surrounding the Flag piece with Bombs is a popular strategy, you will benefit from keeping some of your Miner pieces in play. Having Miners on hand will help you to defuse Bomb pieces later in the game and hopefully capture your opponent’s flag., Scouts are helpful in identifying your opponent’s frontline pieces, so it is a good idea to keep some Scouts in your front row. Since Scouts are low-ranking pieces, you can afford to lose a few in the first few turns if it helps you to identify some of your opponent’s higher ranking pieces., Although you do not want to have all of your high-ranking pieces up front, it is wise to have a few in your first two rows so that you can use them if necessary. Otherwise, your opponent’s high-ranking pieces may take out an entire row of your low-ranking pieces before you can stop him or her., Stratego requires you to use your memory skills and pay attention to what pieces are where as your opponent attacks. It is also helpful to note the pieces that never move during the game. These pieces are likely to be Bombs, so you may want to send your Scouts to check them out or send Miners to defuse them."

Graduate high school.,
Graduate from the police academy.,
Complete a four-year degree in a related subject.,
Continue your police education as you work as an officer.,
Pass the detective exam.",How to Become a Homicide Detective1," Most precincts require you to be a uniformed officer before becoming a detective. A high school diploma or GED is required to begin working as a uniformed officer.Some precincts will even expect additional education or specialized police training on top of your high school education. Check with the precinct that you want to work for to see their education requirements.;
, In some jurisdictions, you'll complete a police course at a local community college or state-sponsored police class before applying for a job as an officer. In other precincts, you'll apply to become an officer first and then get sponsored by the district to complete academy training. Call the precinct or do a search online to see what the procedure is in your area and apply to the academy.


The average police academy course is 18 weeks long.At the police academy, you'll learn things like arresting and booking procedures, firearm use, stress management, communication tactics, information on laws, and police strategies., While being a uniformed officer may only require a high school diploma or equivalent degree, to become a homicide detective it's likely you'll have to complete a four-year bachelor's degree.Choose a major in a related field of study such as criminal justice, criminal administration, law enforcement, criminology, police science, forensics, or crime scene investigation.Other useful courses include law classes, computer classes, and police studies classes.Some of the best universities for criminal justice include the University of Pennsylvania, the Northeastern University School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, the University of California at Irvine, and the CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Federal agencies like the FBI and DEA require a four-year degree., Education is a career-long endeavor for most law enforcement officers and is a requirement in many police districts.Classes in new technical systems will provide you with additional knowledge that you may need to solve a homicide. Also, understanding of new and cutting edge forensic technology will aid you in your job.


You can take additional classes in communication, cultural diversity, technical studies, legal studies, and skill development., The most critical part of being promoted as a field officer to detective is passing the detective exam. While the test will differ depending on the precinct, tests like The National Detective/Investigator Test is used by many different police precincts across the country.Typically a detective exam will include questions in areas such as criminal investigations, interviewing techniques, and relevant case law.
Your district sometimes provides a study guide or preparation courses.

Find a theme to your song.,

Come up with a melody.,
Write lyrics.,
Perfect and rewrite if necessary.,
Make sure you have a safe quiet place to be in and relax before you start.Stretch or do some yoga, then drink some water and relax.",How to Get Good Song Ideas," First off, you need to figure out what you want your song to represent. Will it be a song about love and romance? heartache and pain? or maybe dragons and elves? During this process, it’s best to identify how you are feeling and what your mood is. What’s currently inspiring you? Maybe you’re feeling completely mundane, and you feel as though there’s no inspiration in your life. In this instance, it may be a good idea to draw from other sources. Here are some you might want to try:


Conversations: Maybe you’ve had a really good conversation with someone recently. Try to think of some of the key points of that talk, and translate it into lyrics.
Movies: Think back to one of your favorite movies. What emotions did that film spark? You can either write a song about the movie, or simply gather certain ideas from it.
Novels and/or poems: What’s the latest book you’ve read? If you haven’t read anything lately, try picking up a book and gathering ideas from that. Poems are another good alternative to draw from.;
, This is an important step and sometimes a hard decision to make. Do you naturally come up with words or melodies faster? This should help in determining which one you choose. If you find that you’re inclined to hum out a melody much quicker than you do writing lyrics, then it’s probably best to pick up your guitar or sit down at your piano first. If you’re one who can really jot down lyrical ideas fast once the can of worms has been cracked, then find somewhere quiet to sit down and start writing. The following two steps are interchangeable depending on which one you have decided to tackle first.

, Coming up with great melody is a tricky concept. Generally, the simpler the melody is, the more effective it will be. Here in lies the tricky part however, coming up with that perfectly simplistic melody, without seeming amateur or “cheap”. Don’t be frightened by this though, remember, stay genuine and good things will happen. Be patient and really take the time to come up with your best work.


Start by playing simple chords on your instrument. Keep in mind what kind of theme you have decided for your song. If it’s dark or sad, you might want to stick to minor chords. If it’s happy and up-tempo you might be better of with major chords. For electronic music, it is best to make sure you have a basic synth, then play around with it until you find something good.
Start humming or whistling different melodies over the chords.
Invest in a Dictaphone or micro-recorder, you never know when that perfect melody may come along and it’s best to document it while it’s fresh in your mind.
If you play guitar and like to play open chords, invest in a capo. This will assist you in trying new keys to play in.
Challenge yourself by learning new scales and chords. This will add depth and ultimately make your music richer.

, In most cases, lyrics are going to create the initial impression that your audience responds to, so it’s best to make every word count. Timing and delivery of your words are key. Try to think of different rhyming schemes and ways of conveying your message.


If you get stuck, try using tools such as rhyming dictionaries or a thesaurus.
Make sure you are using words in the right context. Use a dictionary if you are unsure.

, It’s important to make sure your song is the best it absolutely can be. There’s not much point in spending a lot of time on a tune that you’re not completely satisfied with. There is a fine line however, in knowing when your song is complete. Some artists may go too far in rewriting their songs, that they end up losing the initial essence that made the song good in the first place. Try not to get stuck in that sort of trap. Remember, you will always be your own worst critic, so don’t go too far down the rabbit hole, or you may never come back.


Continually challenge yourself, asking, “is this absolutely the best I can come up with for this section?”

, Make sure you have a notebook or computer to write your lyrics. After you do that, the words should come to you


Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try thinking outside the box, but not too far as to where no one else will be able to identify with your music (unless that is what you want of course)
Play the song for a friend or family member who isn’t afraid to give you honest feedback.

If you don’t want to soak paper towels, you can soak pinecones ahead of time, place in a large sealable plastic bag and bring camping.







, Combine 4 cups bacon grease with 2 cups of cool water, 4.2 ounces of lye and food coloring. Heat in a large pot and pour into a mold. Allow several hours for it to cool.

,, Pour cooled grease into a small glass cup or bowl with a wick in it..


Tie a cotton string to the middle of a stick or toothpick (depending upon the width of the cup or bowl). You want most of the string to hang into the bacon grease with a small amount sticking up on top.






Lay the toothpick or stick across the top of the jar or cup.






Light the top of the string and allow it to burn. After 15 to 30 minutes the bacon grease becomes a solid.

Get involved.,

Understand the risks young people face.,
Teach the “Five C’s.” If a violent situation should arise in school, the “Five C’s” are a set of methods used to keep students safe and stop the violence.",How to Take Action to Prevent School Violence3," One of the best ways you can work to prevent violence in schools is getting involved. This may mean joining the PTA at your child’s school, coaching a sports team, or organizing a community event. The better you are able to get to know your child (as well as the other children around them), and build a sense of community, the less likely violence is to occur., You can help prevent violence in schools by encouraging young people to speak up when they see or hear something that’s not OK. Some students may not want to get involved, but explain that by conveying information through safe channels, they may be able to prevent a serious threat of violence., Children and young adults today face a number of stressors that many adults are not fully aware of. The pressures of social media, substance abuse, dating and sex, and bullying can weigh heavily on young people. The pressure to succeed in school can also overwhelm young people. Becoming aware of the sources of stress in the lives of your children or students can make you a better advocate and source of support when they need you., Memorizing this acronym and teaching it to students can both work to prevent violence, and create a plan of action should violence unfortunately occur. The “Five C’s” are:


Calmness: No matter what, attempt to remain calm and clear-headed.
Cover: Seek something to hide behind or under to decrease your chances of being injured
Common sense and instincts: Move away from the shooter, windows, and doors. Use your common sense and instincts to stay safe.
Creativity: Try thinking of something that hasn’t been done before, such putting soap on the floor to trip the assailant.
Cellphone or landline phone: Get to a phone and call Emergency Services.

Look for symptoms of a heart attack.,
Identify symptoms of a blocked artery in the kidney.,
See your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.,
Remain still and do no activity if medical care is not available right away.",How to Identify Symptoms of Clogged Arteries1," Specific symptoms can signal the beginning of a heart attack, during which oxygen-rich blood does not feed the heart muscle. If the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood, part of it can die. The amount of damage to the heart muscle can be reduced when you are treated with medications at a hospital within one hour of experiencing the symptoms. The symptoms include:Chest pain or pressure
Chest heaviness or tightness
Sweating or ""cold"" sweats
Feeling of fullness or indigestion
Nausea and/or vomiting
Lightheadedness
Dizziness
Extreme weakness
Anxiety
Rapid pulse or irregular heart rhythm
Shortness of breath
Pain radiating down the arm
Pain described mostly commonly as squeezing or tightness of the chest, but not sharp pain
Note that in women, elderly, and those with diabetes, heart attacks often don't have many of the common symptoms and can even present as other symptoms altogether. Fatigue is common.;
, These can be different than the symptoms of a blocked artery elsewhere. Suspect a blocked artery in the kidney if you experience: high blood pressure that is difficult to control, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, itching skin, or difficulty with concentration.If the artery is completely blocked, you may experience fever, nausea, vomiting, and steady aching pain in the lower back or abdomen.
If the blockage is from small blockages that lodge in the renal artery, you may also have similar blockages in other areas of your body, such as in your fingers, legs, brain or intestines.

, While you may not be totally sure that you have a blocked artery, it's better to be safe than sorry. Contact your doctor and describe your symptoms her. Your doctor will either tell you to come into her office or to go to your closest emergency room.

, Rest quietly until medical care arrives. By remaining very still you will reduce the oxygen needs and workload of the heart muscle.


If you think you are having a heart attack, chew 325 mg of full-strength aspirin once you have contacted emergency services. If you only have baby aspirin, take four 81 mg pills. Chewing before swallowing will help the aspirin work faster.

Assess the problem.,
State the property that will be proved using induction.,
Understand the concept behind mathematical induction.,
Prove the base case for the property holds true.,
State the inductive hypothesis.,
Prove the inductive hypothesis holds true for the next value in the chain.,
Conclude the property is validly proved by mathematical induction.",How to Do Induction Proofs1," Let's say you are asked to calculate the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers, written as , by induction.(The last term here derives from the fact that if you double any number and then subtract 1 from that value, the resulting number will always be odd.) At first, you might notice that the sum of consecutive odd numbers seems to follow a pattern (e.g., 1 + 3 = 4; 1 + 3 + 5 = 9; 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16; 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25).The sum seems to be the number of odd numbers you are adding squared, right? Now that we have an idea of the pattern at play here, we can begin our proof.;
, In our example, we have noticed a pattern relating to the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers. To complete the task we are assigned (i.e., calculating the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers), we could actually take the time to write out all the odd numbers, starting with 1 all the way to ""n,"" and add them up. But there is an easier way. Based on what we observed about the first few summations we did, we could offer this property, which we will try to prove via induction:


1 + 3 + . . . + (2n - 1) = n^2
We will refer to this property as P(n), because ""n"" is the variable we used above.
The left-hand sign of the equation represents the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers, beginning with 1.

, It is helpful to think of induction in terms of dominoes, which recalls the ""chain of implications"" discussed in the introduction above. Think of every value of ""n"" in the property above, P(n), as an individual domino, arranged in a line. If we can show that P(1)—the first value in the chain—is true, that means we can knock over the first domino. Further, if we assume that any one domino can be knocked over (i.e., P(n) holds true for some arbitrary value of ""n"") and, with that assumption, that the following domino can also be knocked over (i.e., P(n + 1) is also true), that means we can knock over all the dominoes with our stated property. This means the property is true in all cases and we have achieved our goal through induction.

, The ""base case"" for a particular property is some small value used to show that the first statement of the property holds true. In this case, we will use ""1,"" as this is the first odd number and easy to work with. If the property holds true for the base case, we will have shown we can knock over the first domino and we can move on to the next step.


P(1): 1 = 1^2
P(1): 1 = 1 (It held, we're good. First domino down.)

, The next step of induction involves making an assumption. In our example, we will assume that for some arbitrary value of ""n""—let's say ""k""—that the statement is true. That is, we have faith that our property will hold regardless of the value used for ""n."" If this wasn't true, our property (i.e., our solution to the original problem of calculating the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers) wouldn't have much use. While we haven't proved anything yet, this assumption is important, and takes the following form:


P(k): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) = k^2
Remember that we are assuming this is true going forward in the proof (i.e., that we can knock over any individual domino in the chain).

, In other words, we assume that P(k) holds true and, using that assumption, try to prove that P(k + 1) also holds true. If we can do that, we have proven that our theory is valid using induction because if knocking down one domino (assuming P(k) is true) knocks down the next domino (using that assumption, proving P(k + 1) is also true), all the dominoes will fall and our property will be proved valid. So let's try that:


P(k): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) = k^2 is true.
P(k + 1): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
The italicized portion above on the left-hand side of the equation represents the addition of the next odd-numbered term in the sequence, k + 1. If we can make that left-hand side equal the right-hand side, we will have succeeded.
From our assumption, we know that the un-italicized portion above equals k^2, so let's make that replacement.
P(k + 1): k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
P(k + 1): k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
P(k + 1): (k + 1)^2 = (k + 1)^2

, By use of a little algebra, we have proved that our property holds true not only for some arbitrary value of ""n,"" but also for the value following that value. We have shown that P(1) is true, assumed that P(k) is true, and proved that, based on that assumption, P(k + 1) is also true. To use our continuing domino analogy, we successfully knocked down the first domino, showing our property has some value. Then, assuming that any arbitrary domino in the chain could be knocked over, we proved that doing so will necessarily knock down the next domino, ad infinitum down the rest of the chain. Thus, we have shown that our property holds in general and have successfully concluded our proof by mathematical induction.

Think about breakfast.",How to Choose Snacks for a Sleepover," The location of your sleepover can affect a great deal of what you can and can't choose for snacks. You'll need to consider the temperature of the area, as well as the surroundings - a cold night might not be the best night for frozen yogurt!

If you'll be on carpeting or rugs, you might want to avoid snacks that would be messy if spilled, such as nachos or ice cream. Similarly, you'll want to avoid foods or drinks that will stain if spilled.
If you're outside in warm weather, you'll want to avoid things that will attract bees and wasps (such as sodas), and food that will melt too quickly to be enjoyed. You may also need to cover foods so that bugs don't infiltrate them.;
, Some snacks require being kept in certain temperatures, while others need to be stored in a certain way, and still others can just be hard to serve (such as small unwrapped candies). If you need to go to great lengths to keep the snacks edible, then it may be more effort than it's worth to have the snack available in the first place.

Using coolers or small bowls given to individual guests can be of great use when having treats that can be tough to store or serve.

, Some people can't eat certain foods for whatever reason - some common causes are allergies, food intolerances, being vegetarian or vegan, or sensitivity to certain foods (such as spicy foods). Ask your guests if there's anything they can't eat, and write it down to make sure you remember., If your party follows a certain theme, having your snacks stick to that theme will keep the guests more entranced in the theme. This doesn't mean that the snacks you wanted can't be at your party - just find ways to make them match the theme. Try looking up ideas for themed party snacks.

For example, if you're having a Harry Potter sleepover, you could have Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, chocolate frogs, butterbeer, pumpkin juice, and other foods that remind the partygoers of Harry Potter.

, It's known that nobody expects to get much sleep, if any, at a sleepover, but you shouldn't overload yourself or your guests on caffeine at the sleepover. Doing so can result in the guests getting too hyper (which can result in broken household objects) and then having a ""crash"" later, where you get tired suddenly, and possibly grumpy. If you're too hyper, as well, you may end up waking up your parents in the middle of the night!

Caffeine is in things like coffee, soda, and chocolate, as well as energy drinks. While you may not want to avoid all of these, don't have a lot of them, either.

, Lots of classic sleepover snacks can have a neat twist put on them to make them more exciting, or new recipes can pop up that you'd never even thought of. Try looking in cookbooks or searching online for sleepover recipes. Pinterest, for example, has masses of creative snack recipes for sleepovers, even themed ones., If you can't find anything suitable, don't have a theme to follow, and are completely stumped, try checking with the partygoers on what they'd want or what some good foods to bring would be. You can even try having everyone bring a snack of their choice, or some other similar idea.

For example, you can ask, ""I wanted to get some snacks for the sleepover, but I don't know what I should get. Is there something in particular that you want or that you think everyone else would enjoy?""
If you have friends with dietary restrictions, be sure to ask them for ideas if their dietary restriction may rule out a lot of foods for them (e.g. they're vegan).

, If you're buying snacks for your party and your friends can't eat something, you'll need to make sure that the foods you're buying don't have the ingredients that your friends can't eat. Look at the nutrition information on the packaging and read the ingredients before buying it.

If you really want to have food that contains something that one of your friends can't eat, you may want to label it by putting a Post-It note on a bowl or bag of the food saying ""Contains peanuts"" or ""Has lactose"".
Make sure that there's a good variety for your friends with dietary restrictions to pick from - don't just get one snack that they can eat and nothing else.
If you're making food at home, you'll need to be very careful to make sure the ingredients you're using are safe and that nothing cross-contaminates.

, Many sleepover attendees will enjoy a salty snack during a sleepover, and it's a good change of pace from the normal batch of sweets that some may not want to overindulge on. Some examples of salty snacks you could have are:

Chips (such as potato chips or tortilla chips)

Popcorn (try putting some twists on it)
Hard pretzels
Crackers (try pairing them with peanut butter or cheese)

, Sugary food is often a staple of sleepovers, and are sure to be a hit if your attendees enjoy sugar. Try out classic sleepover staples like:

Ice cream or frozen yogurt
Gummy treats (such as gummy worms or gummy bears)
Rice Krispie treats
Baked goods (such as brownies or cupcakes)

, If the attendees aren't huge fans of junk foods and sugar, don't panic - there are still some options out there. These include:

Vegetable trays

Fruit salad or fruit kabobs

Yogurt parfaits
Traditional ""healthy"" snacks, such as celery and peanut butter

, A favorite sleepover experience is to work with the attendees to make treats, and then enjoy the treats together. Some quick treats (and some sleepover classics!) could be:

Eggless cookie dough
Quick dips, such as bean dip, nacho dip, or avocado dip

Drinks such as hot chocolate (maybe with Oreos) or root beer floats
S'mores

, If your guests won't be eating dinner at the party, but you know the snacks won't be filling enough, small meal foods can be great ""snacks"" and satisfy your friends while still leaving room for the actual snacks. Some small meal-type foods are great choices for sleepovers!

Pizza is a classic choice for sleepovers; try mini pizzas or pizza bites.
Hamburger sliders are small, delicious treats for when you don't want to make whole burgers.
Large soft pretzels are good choices for nibbling on.
Mini tacos can be a delight for those who want a quick meal.

, Nobody wants to be thirsty during a sleepover! Pair your snacks with a drink that matches well, such as:

Soda
Lemonade
Hot chocolate
Fruit juice
Keep water available for those who want it.

, While snacks typically aren't associated with breakfast, a good option for breakfast is to set up a ""breakfast bar"" so that people can take foods that they'd like. Try miniature pancakes or waffles, bagels, mini strips of bacon (try turkey bacon for those who can't eat pork), various fruits, or just miniature boxes of cereal and milk. Giving everyone the opportunity to pick the foods they want can allow for a more ""snack""-type breakfast."

Put on proper safety gear.,
Wipe off any and all paint that that you still can from the fabric.,
Pad the back of the fabric with a thick bit of paper towels or a cotton rag.,
Place paint thinner or turpentine directly on the affected area.,
Scrub the area with detergent.,
Let the garment soak overnight and run it through the laundry the next day.",How to Remove Paint from Fabrics2," Before you begin, remember that paint thinner is quite toxic.When attempting to clean your stains, wear proper safety clothing, including gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator. If you're cleaning the stain while inside in your home, open a window to properly ventilate the fumes. This solvent is also very flammable, so be sure not to bring it near any sort of open flame.


Even though turpentine is less toxic than most paint thinners, there's no harm in being safe and wearing the proper gear when cleaning fabric with it.

, Paint thinner or turpentine works best for oil-based paints, especially if the paint has dried significantly. Oil-based paints are much harder to remove than water-based paints, but can still be attacked with a little bit of know-how.









Keep in mind that oil-based paints take a significantly longer amount of time to dry than washable or latex paints.After an oil-based paint has dried completely, it's a much larger pain to get rid of. If you notice an oil-based paint stain on your clothing, you should rub it out immediately. Your chance of saving the fabric will increase exponentially if you can treat these stains early.
If the stain has set, you can even use a knife or other sharp object to scrape the dried paint from the fabric. Be careful not to stab into the garment and damage it.

, This will help catch any paint that seeps through the back of the fabric. If the paint bleeds through to the other side of your garment, you may end up staining the other side of your fabric. You also don't want to damage the surface that you're working on. This especially important with oil-based paints, as they won't wash out nearly as easily as a latex or water-based paint.









You will have to change out this backing pad a few times throughout the cleaning process. If the paint has bled through completely and stained the pad, then you won't be able to avoid staining other parts of your clothing. Make sure to be conscious of how much paint the pad has been absorbed. If you think the pad will start leaking soon, you should swap it out.

, Make sure that if you're using paint thinner, it's a thinner that matches directly to the paint that was used.Anything too volatile and flammable will most likely damage your fabric. You don't want to discolor your clothing in the process, then you have to be careful with the thinner that you choose. If don't know what sort of paint is responsible for the stain, then your best bet is to use turpentine., After you've treated the stained area properly with your paint thinner or turpentine, you'll want to apply detergent to it. Make sure that if your fabric can't be bleached, you don't use a detergent with bleach. You can apply the detergent liberally to the affected area, blotting it with a small sponge or cloth. Be careful not to rub too harshly, as you could push the paint deeper into the fabric.









If you are still wearing your rubber gloves, you can use your fingers to apply the detergent. If not, don't let your bare skin touch the paint thinner. Many thinners can be quite toxic to your skin, and you want to avoid any potential risk.

, Fill a bucket with hot water and let your stained article sit overnight. Check the tag on your garment to check the maximum temperature that it can handle. When you wake up the next morning, you can run it through a normal laundry cycle. Be sure not to wash it with any other articles of clothing, as you run the risk of staining the rest of your load.


If you see a significant change in the coloration after the first attempt, then it's worth repeating the process again.If not, however, the stain may be permanent. This means you may have to throw the garment out. The more times that you apply the thinner or turpentine to the fabric, the larger the risk of further damage to the material.

Show your support.",How to Baker Act Someone," The Baker Act, also known as the Florida Mental Health Act (Florida Statute Chapter 394, Part I) is a law that was passed to ensure and regulate emergency mental health treatment services for those suffering from a mental illness. This law is meant to protect all people with serious mental illnesses in the State of Florida.The Baker Act provides procedures to guide both voluntary admissions and involuntary examinations of people suffering from a mental illness.
The Act also provides procedures for the involuntary inpatient placement (civil commitment) for someone suffering a mental health crisis.
The Act also provides for involuntary outpatient placement for individuals ordered by a Florida court to receive mental health treatment services as an outpatient.The Act sets forth a patient’s bill of rights, mandates attorney representation for those undergoing involuntary placement proceedings, and prohibits discriminatory admission and retention of individuals without just cause.;
, If you are concerned about a loved one’s mental health status but unsure whether they will be protected within Florida’s mental health system, you should review the patient’s bill of rights as set forth in the Baker Act located at http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0394/0394.html. These rights include:


The right to respect and protection of constitutional rights, including the right to petition the court (habeas corpus) to challenge the legality of being held at a mental health facility.
The right to receive quality treatment regardless of the patient’s ability to pay.
The right to be informed about the risks and benefits of treatment, and the reasons for treatment and hospitalization.
The right to communicate privately with people outside of the facility and immediate access to a patient’s family.
The right to vote in elections, if eligible to vote.
The right to access a phone to report violations of the patient’s bill of rights or abuse and the right to have violations reported on behalf of the patient.
The right to participate in treatment and discharge planning., The Baker Act provides procedures for individuals who are18 years old and older to apply voluntarily for admission to a psychiatric facility or for individuals 17 or under whose parents or guardians apply for admission on the minor’s behalf.


For a person 18 or older, they can be voluntarily admitted if a medical provider finds evidence of mental illness, they are competent to provide express and informed consent and they are suitable for treatment.
A minor 17 or younger can only be admitted after a hearing is held to verify the that the consent was voluntary.
A person who requests voluntary discharge or revokes consent must be discharged unless involuntary status is sought and approved. (§394.4625, Fla. Stat.), For an involuntary examination, a person may be taken to a psychiatric facility if they meet the following criteria:


There is reason to believe that the person has a mental illness; and
The mental illness has caused the person to refuse a voluntary examination after the purpose of the examination was explained; or
The mental illness has caused the person be unable to determine whether an examination is necessary; and
Without receiving proper care and treatment, the person may suffer from neglect, represents a real and present threat to his/her well-being; and it is not clear that this harm can be avoided with the intervention of family and/or friends; or
Without treatment there is a substantial likelihood that the person will hurt himself or others in the near future.(§394.463, Fla. Stat.), The following people can initiate an involuntary examination:


A court can enter an ex parte order (order for the benefit of one party) stating that the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination. The court may hear sworn testimony on the subject and must set forth the findings on which the court based its conclusion.
A police officer can take a person into custody and deliver them to a psychiatric facility for examination if the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination.
A physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatric nurse, mental health counselor, marriage and family therapist, or clinical social worker can execute a certificate, which states that the mental healthcare provider examined the person in question within the preceding 48 hours and that the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination. The healthcare provider must also set forth the reasons supporting his/her conclusions.(§394.463, Fla. Stat.), Monitor the behavior and mental state of the person about whom you are concerned. In order for the Baker Act to be relevant, the person must be suffering from a mental illness, which is defined under Florida law as:


An “impairment of the mental or emotional processes that exercise conscious control of one’s actions or of the ability to perceive or understand reality.”
The impairment “substantially interferes with the person’s ability to meet the ordinary demands of living.”
Mental illness “does not include developmental disability, intoxication, or conditions manifested only by antisocial behavior or substance abuse impairment.”(§394.455(18), Fla. Stat.), If the person with a mental illness is a loved one and appears to be in a lucid state, consider asking them to seek help at a psychiatric facility. When discussing this topic, consider the following:


Stress how worried you are about your loved one.
Explain that with a voluntary admission, they can revoke they their consent and must be discharged unless the doctors find they are suffering from a mental illness, can’t make their own decisions about treatment and/or appear to be a substantial harm to themselves or others.
Approach the topic in a non-threatening manner and back off if the individual becomes violent or shows signs of distress accompanied by adamant refusal.

, If your loved one is already under the care of a mental health professional and you are concerned about a change in behavior or the manifestation of a mental illness, contact your loved one’s doctor and discuss the new behavior.The doctor may try to reach out to their patient to assess the situation.
If after examining the patient, the mental health professional feels that the individual meets the criteria for an involuntary examination, then they may initiate the process under the Baker Act.
The mental health professional or case worker will then need to execute a certificate stating that the examination has taken place within the past 48 hours.
Any certificate issued will be sent to local law enforcement. From there, a law enforcement officer will take the named patient to the nearest receiving facility.

, If your family member with a mental illness refuses to speak with a mental healthcare professional, and you believe that they meet the criteria for involuntary examination, you can file an ExParte Petition for Involuntary Examination with the court. You can download the petition form here: www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/MentalHealth/laws/3002.doc. As part of the petition, you must include the following information:


Your name, home address, occupation and work address.
The name, address, and identifying information for the person for whom you are requesting an involuntary examination.
A description of your relationship with the person for whom you are requesting an involuntary examination, such as: whether you are family members; whether you are on good terms; how long you have known each other; whether you have ever called the police on the person and why; and whether you have ever gone to court related to the person and why.
A description of the concerning behavior and whether the behavior was caused by intoxication and not mental illness.
A description of why you believe the person has a mental illness, whether you believe they are at risk for substantial harm to themselves or others, and whether you tried to secure voluntary mental health services for the person., If your loved one is in need of urgent care and you are concerned that they are in immediate danger, you can call your local law enforcement and inform them of the situation. An officer can take a person who displays outward signs of the necessary criteria to a receiving facility for an examination.


This is usually done in cases where no time can be wasted. For instance, if someone has attempted suicide or is threatening suicide, self-harm, or harm to another individual, you should call the police instead of resorting to another method.

, Under the Baker Act, the person taken for an involuntary examination will be seen at the nearest mental health receiving facility. Under the Baker Act, the facility will gain custody of the individual but that custody will only last for 72 hours.Upon admission, the patient will receive a mental health examination and any emergency treatment necessary to stabilize his/her immediate condition.
Within 72 hours, the patient must be released or the facility must file a petition for involuntary placement.
A psychiatrist or clinical psychologist must approve the patient’s release.

, If the situation proves serious enough after the initial exam, the mental health facility might petition to place the patient under IIP.


IIP is the same thing as civil commitment. The individual will be admitted for further mental health treatment beyond stabilization of the mental health crisis and without the patient’s consent.
The patient must meet criteria similar to the criteria for involuntary examination.
The IPP must be supported by a psychiatrist and must also be backed by a second psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist.
After reviewing the petition and hearing medical testimony, a court can order IIP.
A court can order an IIP for up to six months, and the stay can be extended after additional court hearings.
The patient will receive treatment at a state mental health treatment facility or at a short-term residential treatment facility., IOP is less common than IIP. This is a form of commitment, pursuant to a court order, whereby a patient seeks mental health treatment on an out patient basis., Recovery from mental illness is very difficult and your loved one will need compassion and support during the entire process.


Continue to show support during any court-ordered treatment and after that treatment has concluded.
If you suspect that the problem is returning, address those concerns appropriately by discussing them with the individual in question or by consulting a mental health professional.

Add salt and pepper.",How to Make Mayonnaise With Olive Oil," Fresh eggs are the best, so if you have access to organic or free range eggs, use those.;
, You will need about 6.7 oz. (200 ml) for the 3 eggs.


Use an oil that you have used for dressings or marinades before, and you know you like. Each olive oil has a different flavor and that flavor can come out in the mayonnaise. Many chefs recommend extra virgin olive oil for the best taste.

, You want to use fresh lemon juice for a mayonnaise, nothing artificial or squeezed from a bottle.

, Sea salt is best if you have it, and freshly ground pepper will also provide your mayonnaise with a pleasing taste.

, While whisking it by hand takes more time and a little muscle, it can often provide better results. Electric mixers can put extra heat into the mayonnaise, which can cause the oil and the eggs to separate.

, This will keep the bowl from moving while you whisk. If you are going to use an electric mixer or blender, place it on a flat surface.

, Gently crack the egg open and allow the the runny egg white to run out of the shell while you transfer the yellow yolk to your hand or the other side of the shell when you open it. If you place the yolk in your hand, the egg white will run through your fingers.

, Once all of the yolks are combined, add 1 tsp (4.5 ml) of water to the eggs and continue to beat. The water will help the emulsion process as the oil is added.

, It is important to go slowly, or the oil will separate and not combine with the yolks.


Incorporate each drop of olive oil completely before you add another drop. If you are using a blender or a mixer, keep it running through the whole process.

, You do not want to see the oil moving to the side of the bowl or forming large drops on the surface of the eggs.

, You do not have to do one drop at a time at this point, but you do need to proceed very slowly.

, The full half lemon will give the mayonnaise a sharp taste, so use less juice if you want a smoother mayonnaise.

, Taste the mayonnaise and season it to taste.

Look as ""normal"" as possible.",How to Make People Leave You Alone3," If you're locked into a podcast or some tunes, you've got a ready-made excuse for not having heard something someone said, and most people will take the hint, and won't even try. Even if you're not a big music fan, just wear headphones and listen to nothing. It works great as a prop.

, You can learn to look unapproachable by giving people the impression that you're closed off to communication.In general, the physical signs of ""closed"" body language that help to communicate a desire to be left alone include:


Crossed arms
Crossed legs
Slouching
Looking downward
Avoiding eye contact

, If you look like you're completely immersed in an activity, people will leave you alone for the most part. Bring a book, a stack of papers, or pull out your phone, and put on a calculated scowl, to look like you're concentrating really hard.


You can take this too far and elicit unwanted attention. Don't scowl so hard and make such hefty work sighs that the person next to you says, ""What you got going on?""

, If, despite your unapproachable nature, someone tries to approach you, you can cut most conversations off by being generally distant and un-socialable. Avoid making eye contact, keep your resting face blank, and use single-word responses, no matter how difficult the question.


If someone says, ""How you doing?"" just say, ""Fine."" If someone says, ""What you up to?"" just say, ""Nothing."" If someone says, ""Can I get you a drink?"" just say, ""No."" This will get boring quickly, and you'll be alone again.

, Of course, you should dress however you want to dress, because the way you look and your appearance aren't code for being approachable or not approachable. You can, however, avoid unwanted attention by blending in with the crowd. If you're out in public wearing a beaver hat and a purple zoot suit, it's likely someone will want to talk to you. Just wear what everyone else is wearing, and you'll be practically invisible.

Think over why you want your ex at the wedding.,
Ponder any consequences to inviting your ex.,
Discuss the notion with your fiancé.,
Ask your parents and/or family for their input.,
Consider whether inviting your ex will cause problems for any other wedding guests.,
Get your ex’s opinion.,
Involve your fiancé in seating arrangements.",How to Invite Your Ex to Your Wedding," There are not many compelling reasons to include an ex at a wedding but the exceptions might be sufficient in your own case to override any concerns. For starters, if you're on speaking terms with an ex-spouse, ex-fiancé or an ex from a long relationship, at the very least inform them of the engagement. If you're not on speaking terms, write a note to let them know. If children are involved, your ex needs to know about your marriage and agreed arrangements as to the children's involvement should be arranged. Whatever you do, don't leave it up to the children to answer your ex-spouse's questions about your wedding. Reasons that you might wish to go beyond merely informing your ex and actually inviting them to the wedding include:


You're still really good friends with your ex and there is no animosity between you. There are lots of reasons for why people part amicably and still remain firm friends; that's totally your call and your business. However, if you intend to remain in touch with your ex post-wedding, then the sooner this is clarified for your fiancé, the better.
You want your ex-spouse to be present because you had children together and it will help everyone to meld properly. Again, this is only provided you get along with your ex.
You may have no choice. Your ex may be the husband or wife of a brother, sister or other family member. In which case, there isn't going to be much more to discuss, as it's assumed everyone is going to behave nicely!
Wanting to rub your ex's nose in it is not a valid reason for inviting him or her to your wedding. Your fiancé won't appreciate this motive and neither will your ex; if guests also work out that this is the motive, you'll be publicly shamed.;
, After exploring why you think you want your ex to come to the wedding, also think about any reason why you should not invite your ex. Is the venue for your reception a place that holds romantic connotations for the two of you? Are you going to use music, poetry, songs or other elements that have a romantic meaning or memorable attachment from the time the two of you were together? Or does your ex become confrontational when he or she drinks or gets over-emotional at a social event? Any potential for emotional explosiveness should be thoroughly explored and dismissed before deciding that it's a good idea to invite your ex to the wedding.The last thing you want is a movie scene style sequence of your ex jumping up and objecting to the marriage out of spite or inability to get over you!


If your ex isn't over you and is liable to cry at your wedding ceremony, ditch the whole idea. There is nothing more uncomfortable for everyone present than a public display of weeping for lost love. What a downer!

, The most important step is to make sure your fiancé is completely comfortable with you inviting your ex to the wedding. The best way to approach your betrothed with the invitation is to choose a quiet area in your home or at a restaurant to review the guest list.


Review the list of friends you’d like to invite and ask your fiancé his or her feelings about inviting your ex. Approach the query with an open-ended question and let him or her have the floor to express his or her full opinion. By now, it should be absolutely clear to your fiancé that you are still in regular contact with your ex and have a good friendship.
Make sure that your fiancé knows that you have no strong feelings about having your ex at the wedding. Take a casual approach to whether or not he or she is invited so your fiancé doesn’t have to worry about hurting your feelings. If you want your ex there because of the children, then say so, as this can actually make it easier on your fiancé who will see that this is about broader family implications, not just about old feelings.
Tell your fiancé to be completely honest with his or her feelings and to express his or her gut reaction. Let your fiancé know that it's fine to say no but that you hope for that your fiancé will agree. Be conscious that the thought that goes through the minds of many a person asked to cope with an ex at a wedding is: ""Is he/she going to look at that person and remember all the good times they had together?""
Be prepared to drop the notion of inviting your ex if it seems likely to create deep anxiety for your spouse-to-be and is likely to ruin his or her wedding experience.
Involve your fiancé in laying down ground rules if the ex comes to the wedding. Let your fiancé know that your priority is the wedding and the marriage. Allow your fiancé to establish the ground rules based on his or her comfort level and stick to them. For example, during the reception, you can only have small talk with your ex and no dances or lengthy discussions. Or perhaps your ex is only allowed to attend the wedding but not the reception. Work out together what sits most comfortably for both of you.

, In some cases, the ex may be a family friend, which will negate any issues with the invitation on your parents’ part. However, if you originally didn’t part ways on a high note or if your parents or other relatives have a beef with your ex, you may want to broach the subject with the relevant relative. Avoid springing the announcement on the family during a public occasion such as dinner if a family member is uncomfortable with your ex. Instead, as with your fiancé, discuss the matter in a quiet, private room where you can open the discussion to honest feelings and opinions.

, As with your family, consider if your ex’s presence will set off another guest. The last thing you want is a boxing match or a showdown at your elegant affair. Mentally review your entire guest list to ensure there are no conflicts, no other complicated relationship skeletons in the closet that could spring forth during the heady emotionalism of a wedding. If you discover a potential for conflict, determine if you can discuss the invitation with the relevant guest or even consider not inviting that particular guest, if feasible. Naturally, this will involve weighing up who is the most apt to invite to your wedding out of the guest with a potential for conflict or your ex.

, Obviously, if you want to invite your ex, it's presumed that you're still on friendly terms. All the same, he or she may be uncomfortable with the whole concept of being invited to your wedding and their feelings should be respected. When asking them if they'd mind coming, explain your reasons for having them come along. In addition, explain how the ceremony will play out and what type of reception you plan to throw (if you're planning on inviting your ex to the reception as well). Be sure to let your ex know who else is invited and reassure your ex that he or she is absolutely allowed to bring a date.

, Avoid seating or locating your ex near any other ex-flames or anyone who might be unhappy being near him or her. In the church or hall, your ex should be seated or located away from the front rows, where immediate family sits or stands. At the reception, your ex should not be seated at any of the primary tables unless this is important for keeping an eye on very young children. Even then, it would be better to ask other family members to do that instead if the children need to be at the primary tables. At all times, be considerate as to who will be forced to mingle with whom as a result of seating arrangements.

Know that bullies get off on power.,
Think about how bullies fit into the social hierarchy.,
Realize that bullying doesn't just happen with kids.,
Consider that some bullies are also bully-victims.,
Don't assume it's personal.",How to Defend Yourself from Bullies4," Bullying happens due to an imbalance of power. Bullies tease and pick on kids who are smaller or younger than them. Plus, bullies target peers who are not as accepted socially as they are.A bully is unlikely to pick on a kid who is popular and well-liked. Instead, these individuals pick on kids who are relatively unknown or socially ostracized because other kids are less likely to stand up for them.
Some bullies may come from families who have financial difficulties. They may grow up without many superficial items that other kids have so they end up bullying kids who appear to be richer than them.

, Bullies generally pick on kids who they perceive to go against the norms of the school environment. You may have different hobbies or likes than the masses and be targeted for being different.For example, if the school is big on sports and one kid performs very poorly in sports, this kid may be picked on for failing to meet the social expectation that students at that school are good in sports.
Kids who are observed as seemingly gay or lesbian are also known to be targets of bullying. At home, the bully's parents or the community may have a strong opposition to individuals with sexual orientations other than heterosexual. Therefore, parents can often model unacceptable behaviors that their children imitate at school.
Some kids are bullied because they are socially awkward. Perhaps, they have developmental delays or learning disabilities. Other kids may tease these students and refuse to allow them to join in on activities or sit with them at lunch., Since bullying exists because of an imbalance of power, it can happen in various situations, even to adults. Individuals with higher rank or better connections may engage in bullying behaviors in the workplace, selecting an employee perceived to be weaker and hitting, teasing, or intimidating this person., Children often are modeled behaviors in the home that result in bullying in schools. For instance, some children are physically or verbally abused by their parents or older siblings at home. These kids may go to school and act out those same behaviors with kids they see as weaker.Bully-victims frequently have trouble fitting in, have greater emotional problems, and feel unsafe at school.

, Even though a bully may pick on you because you are different or socially isolated, that does not mean it's about you. Bullies simply choose targets to humiliate and intimidate because they get off on this kind of behavior and it makes bullies feel better about themselves.


Being the target of bullying can be a difficult experience emotionally and mentally. It will not help your situation to internalize it and beat yourself up. Remember, it is not your fault.

Teach your baby “Patty Cake.” Patty Cake is a popular children’s tune with a sequence of accompanying hand motions.,
Show your child “The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.” This song describes the trials and travails of a spider who meets with some initial misfortune but ultimately prevails.,
Change your baby’s position regularly.,
Give your baby lots of objects.,
Play with your baby.",How to Build Your Baby's Motor Skills2," To perform the hand motion, sit your baby in your lap so that you are both facing the same direction. Clap your baby’s hands together, then take the baby’s left hand and stretch it forward with the palm facing ahead. Then bring the baby’s hands back together to clap again. Move your baby’s right hand forward with the palm facing out just as you did with the baby’s left hand. Repeat until the song is complete.Check the song out online with a video of the accompanying hand motions so you can better understand how they fit together.
Later, when your child is better able to perform the hand motions, you can sit across from them and play Patty Cake together.Your child will be much impressed by both of you performing the same actions in tandem.

, Turn your left palm inward so it faces you. Place your right index finger against your left thumb and your left index finger against your right thumb. Then, at the same time, rotate both hands so that your right thumb and left index finger are oriented above your other fingers. Repeat for the first stanza of the song.The next part of the song describes rainfall. Put your hands up in the air and splay your fingers. Bring them down slowly while wiggling them.
The next part of the song describes a sunrise. Place one hand over the other and bring your elbows inward slightly so that your arms approximate an inverted “U”. Slowly lift your arms to indicate the rising sun.
Repeat the first hand sequence of the song to complete it.
Check the song out online with a video of the accompanying hand motions so you can better understand how they fit together.

, Instead of only setting your baby on their back or stomach, try setting them on their side. When babies are in new positions, they are forced to exercise different muscle groups and move in new ways.After your baby is about 4 months old, you can pull your baby up into a standing position by gripping them beneath their armpits. As they put one foot on front of the other, move your baby forward slowly. This will help your baby develop the motor skills eventually used to walk and run.Move your child to new environments, too. For instance, place your baby in their crib, then move them to the floor., Provide your baby with age-appropriate playthings of different types to help them understand how to grab, move, drop, and toss objects with different weights, sizes, and textures.For instance, your baby will have great fun with plush toys, soft blocks, balls, and household items like plastic cups and plates.
Make sure your baby has age-appropriate items and objects. Do not give your baby anything with small parts, or with parts that could break off, as the parts might get lodged in the baby’s throat. Similarly, avoid giving your baby anything that has a rope or string that could present a choking hazard.

, In addition to independent play, your baby will benefit from playing games with you using the objects you’ve provided for them. For instance, if your baby has a ball, roll it across the floor toward them. This will give your baby the opportunity to develop hand-eye coordination as they move to intercept it.You might also help your baby develop grasping skills by tugging gently on a particular object they are holding. This should, with repetition, inspire your baby to grasp more tightly to objects you tug on.
You could build a block tower with your baby. Your baby might also enjoy knocking such a tower down, which involves a different set of movements."

Sew the fabric ends together by hand.,
Accessorize your scrunchie.,
Test the strength.,
Wear it!",How to Make Scrunchies," Use elastic that’s between 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide. It should be about 4 inches (10 cm) long, or 1 inch (2.5 cm) more if your hair is extra thick., Your final piece of fabric should be about 8 inches (20.32 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide if you use 4 inches (10 cm) of elastic. Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) onto the length if you added 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the elastic length. There's no need to adjust the width of the fabric. Fold the longest side of a rectangular piece of fabric at about 4 inches (10 cm) from the edge in order to cut along the fold., Remember to always cut a little bit extra fabric just in case you need more to sew. Feel free to cut past your initial measurements. Oftentimes you can take fabric in, but you can’t take it out once it’s cut., Fold the fabric you cut out in half lengthwise so that the printed or colored side is facing inwards. Pin and sew a straight line by hand or with a sewing machine, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

, After you sew the long side of your fabric, you should have a tube with two open ends. Turn the tube so the printed sides are facing out., Attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and feed it through the fabric tube. Make sure to hold the other end of the elastic so it is not pulled through the tube. Pin the two ends of elastic together so that they overlap slightly., Sew stitches in the shape of a square so that the square covers the overlap, and then sew a diagonal through this box. The x-box stitch will ensure that the elastic will not come apart when you tug on it.Hand sew or use a sewing machine for this part.
Make sure not to sew the fabric to the elastic during this step.

, Use a whip stitch so the stitching will not be seen from the outside of the scrunchie. To make a whip stitch, first place the raw edges of the fabric on top of each other and fold the ends slightly inward. Sew stitches around the ends, alternating the stitch between each fabric end., Tie or sew coordinating ribbons, bows and other accessories to add unique flair to your scrunchie. Use bells for Christmas, dangling hearts for Valentine's Day or red and blue ribbon for 4th of July. Be creative by attaching silk flowers or sequins., Carefully pull your hair into a loose ponytail. The scrunchie should be able to be pulled like a regular elastic. If the scrunchie breaks, don't be discouraged! Try making another, but focus on strongly sewing the elastic together.

, Sweep your hair off your shoulders or neck and show off your new scrunchie. Wear a loose ponytail, or pull your hair up with a regular elastic and put your homemade scrunchie over the top if you want it extra tight.

The secret of a happy life lies in accepting and knowing.",How to Face Life's Problem," Everything stems from our inability to recognize it. Sometimes we don't see the difference between what is real and what is the creation of our own thinking.;
, Acceptance will elevate you to a better understanding about the problem. Once you accept it's reality, you will open up to a lot of possibilities on how to deal with it. Accepting the facts that trials, troubles and difficulties spare no man and it is as inevitable as the sunrise.

, Now, as soon as you recognize and accept that there is a problem, you need to know what it is. Sometimes during this process, you are already finding the solution to the problem. More often than not, the problem stems from miscommunication or misunderstanding. More than that, this normally leads to blessing in disguise.

, The wise and mature individual can turn a problem into a growth-giving experience. If you have learned how to accept the reality of trouble in your life, if you have learned how to deal with it effectively, then you can be relatively happy.

, We must understand that since problem cannot be avoided, knowledge and skills for dealing with them is not enough. We must possess a healthy dose of courage to rise up and stand the ground and have faith in the Greater Power that creates us, cares about us and watches over our destinies.

Choose a hop variety for your aroma hops.,
Prepare the hops for addition into the wort.,
Lower the aroma hops into the boiling wort.,
Consider adding the aroma hops at knockout if desired.,
Remove the aroma hops.,
Compost or discard the spent aroma hops.",How to Add Aroma Hops to Beer," Any variety of hops can be used for aroma hopping; most likely, you will be brewing from a recipe kit that will specify what type and amount of hops you should use. If you are not brewing from a given recipe, note that you will often achieve a cleaner, clearer flavor when using only 1 type of aroma hops.;
, Whether you are using pellet hops or full-leaf hops, you will need a way to submerge them into and retrieve them from the boiling wort. The easiest method is to tie the hops into cheesecloth bags; many brewing supply stores sell ""hop bags"" designed specifically for this purpose.

, Aroma hops should be added in the final 15 minutes of the boil or later. Adding them to the wort before this time will cause too many of the hops' volatile oils to evaporate, which will minimize the amount of aroma imparted.


The time at which you add the aroma hops will be specified by your recipe (if using one). In general, the later you add the hops, the fainter but more nuanced the aroma and flavor imparted will be.
Swirl the cheesecloth bag around a bit in the boiling wort to ensure that the hops are soaked through.

, Instead of adding the aroma hops late in the boil, you can actually add them ""at knockout,"" meaning at the point when you turn off your heat source. Doing this will preserve nearly all of the hops' volatile oils, but can also lend the beer a grassy flavor that may clash with the overall flavor profile.

, After turning off the heat (or allowing the hops to steep for a few minutes if added at knockout), remove the cheesecloth bags containing your bittering, flavoring, and aroma hops. You can now chill the wort and prepare to transfer it into your fermenting vessel.

, If you brew beer regularly, you will generate a large amount of used hops. Because these hops are organic matter, they can be readily composted, which helps reduce pressure on landfills.

Figure out what you are feeling.,
Reflect on why you are being emotional.,
Redirect yourself with questions.,
Look for triggers.,
Allow yourself quiet time.,
Step away from a situation.,
Relax your facial expression.,
Breathe before responding.,
Refrain from making decisions.,
Analyze your reaction.,
Develop a thick skin.,
Decide if the person deliberately hurt you.,
Look ahead.,
Talk to someone.",How to Stop Being Emotional," Sometimes, the emotion we express isn't reflective of what we actually feel. We end up accusing people of making us feel something, like stupid, worthless, unattractive, or unwanted. Figure out what you are really feeling. Why did you respond this way? What is this response connected to? Look inward to find the real issue you are responding to., When you feel tears welling up or a flare of anger or jealousy, pause. Ask yourself, ""Why am I feeling this way?"" Acknowledging your emotions instead of ignoring them is a first step towards learning to control them.


Figuring out why you feel a certain way helps you not to rationalize. When we rationalize, we end up lying to ourselves and making things worse.Be honest with yourself. You are not doing yourself any favors by lying.

, When you feel a wave of emotions hitting, ask yourself key questions before reacting. Mentally asking yourself these questions can help you avoid reacting immediately, and also calm down as you evaluate the situation. Ask yourself:


Is this emotion going to help me solve anything?
Do I gain more by holding on to this emotion or letting it go?
Am I capable of letting this emotion go?
Can I walk away for a moment so I can gather myself?
Can I control this emotion so I am fully aware of my decisions and the consequences?, Evaluate your life and your habits. Look for things you do that prompt you to feel overly emotional. Remember, you are in control of your emotions and yourself. Though you may react negatively to outside stimuli, you are the one who is ultimately in control of what you think and feel.Are you more emotional when you are stressed? If so, try managing your stress to avoid emotional reactions.
Do you react more emotionally when you haven't slept or eaten well or enough?
Does exercise help you manage your emotions?
Do you get more sensitive in large crowds full of strangers?
Does your work environment make you emotional?
Being able to pinpoint what some of your triggers are can help you avoid situations where you might be emotional, or be better prepared for them.

, Take calming breaks throughout the day. Get up, take a brisk walk, stretch, read something that makes you feel good, call or text a friend, write an e-mail. Do things that make you happy and reduce stress.This will help you stay calm and centered so that you are prepared when you are faced with a difficult, emotional situation.

, When you feel your emotions rising, step a few feet away.Moving yourself physically away just a few feet helps remove you from the immediate source of the emotional drama. The physical act helps you focus on something else, which can quell your anger or stop your tears. As you step away, you can think logically and decide the best way to deal with the situation.


If you find yourself in tears, shaking from anger, or yelling, walk away. Go to the bathroom or another room to collect yourself.

, Frowning with your brows drawn together might influence the way you react. Scrunching your face like you are going to cry could also help trigger tears. Instead, try keeping a neutral face, or even a slight smile. It might not help calm all of your emotions, but it might stop the onset of tears or a raging yelling spurt., Breathing allows you to calm your nervous system and your fight or flight response, which helps you make a clearer decision.Deep breathing helps calm your emotions and lessens anxiety.


Try breathing in through your nose slowly for four seconds. Hold for two seconds. Exhale through your mouth for six seconds. Repeat.Start meditation and relaxation exercises to help control your emotions. Regular yoga exercises can help reduce your stress and aid you in reflecting on why you feel the way you feel.
Breathing can help you if you find yourself being emotional in an inopportune moment. If you are crying or yelling, take a moment to breathe and recenter yourself.

, When your emotions are high, don't make important decisions. During these times, you are not thinking clearly and are not in the state to make a reasoned, rational decision. Don't answer loaded questions when you are feeling overly emotional. You may say something you regret. Instead, remove yourself from the situation. Allow yourself time to process your feelings before you make decisions.

, When you end up in a situation where you are being overly emotional, be cognizant of the fact that you are overly emotional. Then, ask yourself why you are being this way. Are you reacting to things in yourself you have already discovered are sensitive spots? Are you stressed? Are you reacting to this person at all?


H.A.L.T. Ask yourself if you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. Go eat something, take a walk if you're angry, talk to a friend, or get some rest., Everyday we are put in situations that we don't like, that are uncomfortable, or where we are criticized. Sometimes the way a person treats us is not even related to us, but something in the other person's life. Having a thick skin can help you navigate difficult situations without letting your emotions get the better of you.


Be silent and unresponsive. Don't react to everything. Let some things go and just roll off your back.
Stop exaggerated thinking. Being overly emotional sometimes makes us blow things out of proportion. We take something small and insignificant and turn it into something large. Learn not to indulge in thinking like this to avoid inaccurate versions of the truth.
Figure out why things upset you. Is there a way to fix someone's treatment of you? Can you calmly and respectfully address the person who offended or upset you?
Take criticism with a grain of salt. When someone criticizes you, use it as a moment to better yourself. If you disagree with the criticism, trust and believe in yourself enough to ignore the criticism. People will always criticize you; it's a part of life. Learn to take it in stride., Look at what happened from the other person's perspective. Did they mean to hurt you? Were they trying to be helpful? Were they actually being cruel or bullying you? If the person isn't trying to hurt you, focus on your feelings instead of the other person., Ask yourself, ""Am I going to feel this way in an hour, day, or month?"" Many times, emotions are heat-of-the-moment reactions. Yes, in that moment things feel worst-case scenario and like they will never be better. How often do you look back and think, ""Why was I so nervous/upset/angry/sad?"" Remember to look forward.


This strategy will also help you think twice about your reactions. What will your boss/co-worker/friend think tomorrow if you overreact today?

, If you are struggling to deal with your emotions, talk to someone. Your friends and family care about you and will help you. Sometimes, talking helps dissipate some of the pent up emotions. If that doesn't help, consider going to talk to a therapist. They might be able to help you work through your emotions in healthy, constructive ways.

Search for direct purchase content.,
Look for ebook packs.,
Join an ebook membership group.,
Make use of training materials.,
Market your products.,
Create a consistent brand for yourself.",How to Obtain eBook Resale Rights Inexpensively," When someone creates a product or writes some material, they have the right to control what happens to their creation. One of their options is to give or sell “resell rights.” (The words “resell” and “resale” are used interchangeably, but “resell” is the more commonly used word.) In this case, we are talking about ebooks. If you buy regular resell rights to an ebook, you then own the right to sell that ebook to someone else and receive money for it. In a sense, you are becoming like a publisher. You will offer the ebook for sale on your website, people will buy it from you, and you make money.With regular resell rights, you have the right to sell the ebook to a consumer, and that consumer may enjoy it for personal use. The person who buys from you cannot resell the ebook or its contents.;
, If you purchase master resell rights (MRR), then you are buying the legal right to sell the book, just as with regular resell rights. In addition, you can sell resell rights to your customers. In this way, you can presumably charge more, and the customers who buy from you can, in turn, sell the ebook to additional customers and make money for themselves., With both regular resell rights and master resell rights, you may sell the ebook just as a regular publisher or bookstore might sell any book. But if you purchase private label rights (PLR), you then own the right to revise the ebook to suit your own needs before you resell it. You can edit the work, make revisions to the content in any way, and even claim authorship before reselling it.When you purchase PLR, you may receive them with or without limitations. The person selling the PLR to you may limit what you can do with the work. In this case, you would have “restricted PLR.” If you buy PLR without any limitations, then you have “unrestricted PLR.”

, Rebranding rights go beyond PLR. If you purchase rebranding rights, you will have the right to insert your own online links into the ebook, to redirect readers to your website, to encourage them to buy additional products from you., All forms of resell rights apply only to material that is protected by current copyright law. However, certain works are in the public domain, which means that they are not controlled by copyright law. If a book is in the public domain, that means that it is available for anyone to use, revise, control or even sell.For a better understanding of public domain law and whether a particular work is in the public domain, visit the official site of the U.S. Copyright Office at www.copyright.gov., You should begin by selecting a topic that interests you. Then conduct an online search for that topic, using the phrase “resell rights.” You will receive a list of links to sites that offer ebook material for sale. You can review those links and the items they are offering. As you review those listings, pay attention to the type of rights that you are purchasing along with the ebooks.


For example, you may be purchasing access to the ebook, the right to resell it and to sell resell rights to your own customers (MRR), the right to change the graphics, and the right to add it to paid membership sites.
Check to see what you may not do as well. For example, you may not be able to edit the content of a book or add it to free membership sites.

, If you search for resell packs or packets, you will find offers for groups of ebooks on a common theme. Basically, someone else has done the research of finding a group of ebooks on one topic, with similar resell rights, and is now offering them as a collection. Buying an ebook pack will generally cost more than buying an individual ebook, but you will have more materials to choose from, and the work of finding them has been done for you.

, With a quick Internet search, you can find links to a variety of groups, clubs or companies that offer memberships. For a flat fee payment, you can join the club. In exchange, you gain access to a library of ebook material that the membership has resell rights to, and then you obtain the rights to those materials as well. These clubs often also offer to provide you with training or other information to start your reselling business.

, Most of the ebook resellers offer some level of support or training. This is particularly true if you join one of the membership clubs. You should take advantage of these offers and use the training that they provide. The training will explain how to advertise and market your products and reach the most potential customers., To make the most of reselling ebooks, you will need to be adept at creating websites and marketing your products. You need to generate the most visibility possible, and find ways to catch the eye of possible consumers. With rebranding rights and PLR, you can insert your own links into the content of the product, which can help draw even more customers to your site.For example, you may be able to build a mailing list, create a blog, or initiate a newsletter that you can regularly send out to your prospective customers.

, Branding is important with any product. You can increase the attention that your ebooks receive if you create your own brand or style. Be consistent and use this on your website. If you have rebranding rights or PLR, you should revise the ebooks themselves so they all have the same look or style. This will create a consistency that will draw more customers to additional products that you offer.You should adopt a logo and type style and then use them consistently to build customer confidence.Develop a consistent theme for any slides or webinar materials you may put out.
Use document templates consistently.
Select a consistent topic or theme in the products you offer. When you are just starting out, work with one consistent topic, such as fitness or business growth. Then, after building some customer loyalty, branch out to other fields.

Identify the situation that's triggering your feelings of jealousy.,
Build your self-confidence.,
Avoid comparing yourself to other people.,
Do the opposite of what a jealous person would do.,
Recognize the paranoia that is a part of jealousy.,
Be trusting.,
Listen to your feelings without blowing things out of proportion.,
Have reasonable expectations about how much time someone can devote to you.,
Develop an optimistic view of people.",How to Stop Being Jealous," You may feel jealous when:


The guy or girl you like is hanging out with other people, leaving you feeling neglected.
Your best friend seems to prefer spending time with other people.
One of your parents starts spending time with a new partner.
One of your kids seems to prefer being with the other parent instead of with you.
Someone else gets the recognition that you deserve at work or gets credit for something that you did in a school club.;
, Jealousy is usually a by-product of insecurity and low self-worth. You may have fears of being abandoned or rejected by someone close to you. Or, you could be pouring your whole identity into just one obsession or passion, so that when it doesn't go your way, the loss of control or unwanted outcome really shakes your confidence.


The best way to build your self-esteem is to act the way that a confident person would act. Make decisions as though you have all of the confidence in the world. Eventually, your feelings will catch up with your actions.
When confident people get abandoned or ridiculed, it doesn't break them. They know that people are short-sighted sometimes, and they don't blame themselves.
You are good enough. Even if you've messed up, you just need to look at it as a chance to learn something new. That's what confident people do best. Nothing stops them.

, Make friends with someone who you think has it all, and you'll discover that even this person has his or her own hidden struggles.


Even famous and beautiful celebrities have struggles that you can't see. They may get passed over for movie roles that they want, they may lose a big game or they may struggle with drugs and alcohol. Just because someone looks great on the outside doesn't mean that things are going great on the inside.
Instead of focusing on your shortcomings, think about the positive qualities, skills and character traits that you bring to the table. It all goes back to becoming more confident. You have so many great qualities and physical attributes that no one can take away from you.

, When you feel jealousy taking over, don't react in a destructive way by making accusations, giving someone the silent treatment or dropping little sarcastic hints. Instead, try to do what a trusting person would do in your place.


If a friend is going to spend time with someone else, for example, recommend a good movie or restaurant.
If the guy or girl you like is talking to someone else, join the conversation in a friendly way.
When someone else gets the job that you want, be nice instead of being sneaky or trying to undermine the other person. Instead, congratulate the person and offer to help them be successful.

, Jealousy causes you to react to a fantasy scenario that's all in your mind. In reality, the bad things that you're imagining may never happen at all. And if they do, you're strong enough to get through them. You have other people that you can count on in your life, and you'll move on to become a better person.


Your boyfriend or girlfriend may call an ex to express condolences when something awful happens, like the person's mother dies. Don't go crazy about it. First of all, the person that you love isn't necessarily hung up on an ex. Second of all, your boyfriend or girlfriend is being nice and considerate, and that's one of the reasons that you love him or her so much.
Your child may form nurturing relationships with other adults. You may think that your child loves someone more than you, but that suspicion is probably untrue. It takes a village to raise a child, and your child deserves love from as many good people as possible.

, This is a lot easier said than done. If you get jealous easily, you've probably had your trust broken in the past. You have to stop thinking about the past and put yourself in the present. Look at the person who's making you jealous. Has this person ever given you a reason not to trust him/her?


If the person has never disappointed you, then you need to assume the best about the person, not the worst. A good friend will try to support your lack of trust, but only for so long. You're probably transferring your own fears about someone else onto a perfectly good person. And trust is a risk. You have to accept the risk of being wrong to get the benefits that come with trust when you're right.
If someone repeatedly hurts you, then you have to steer clear of the relationship. In this case, you have a really good reason not to trust the person. Move on! You deserve better.

, Your feelings are telling you something valuable. If you're feeling jealous, your emotions are telling you that something is happening that you don't like. They may or may not be accurate (you'll learn to assess this by being open to exploring the feelings) but sometimes, your gut reaction is warning you that there is something you need to be observant about.


For example: Your boyfriend or girlfriend may be more flirtatious with other people than you would like. Rather than assuming the worse, realize that your partner may not even realize that their behavior bothers you. Nevertheless, boundaries need to be set so you both know what's appropriate and what's not in terms of interacting with other people. Ask your partner where he or she draws the line (Flirting? Kiss on the cheek? Peck on the lips? Shoulder massage? Dancing?). See if your partner's boundaries match up with your preferences. Together you can then work through the issues. Talk it over until you can find common ground. Once it's established, trust your partner and don't let jealousy get the best of you.

, If your child or partner isn't spending any time with you, then you may have valid concerns. But if someone spends a good deal of time with you, and you never feel like it's enough, then you're demanding too much.


Look at yourself. What's making you so needy that you can't be happy unless this other person is around?
Branch out and spend more time with other people, or find an activity that makes you happy. Sometimes, all you need to do is to take better care of yourself instead of focusing all of your energy on someone else.

, Ultimately, jealousy is a fear-based behavior. You're spending a lot of time worrying about something bad that hasn't happened yet, and might not happen at all. Unfortunately, you're creating a situation where bad things could happen because of all of your negative feelings. Ironic, isn't it? It's called a ""self-fulfilling prophecy."" If you believe in someone, believe in them completely. Good people deserve the benefit of the doubt.

Remove your old countertop.,
Measure the counter with a measuring tape once it is removed.,
Decide what wood you would like to use.,
Measure and mark your wood.,
Sand your countertops with medium-grit sandpaper, if you want to remove imperfections.,

Apply a wood stain in the color of your choice.,
Apply a polyurethane topcoat.",How to Make a DIY Countertop," Work slowly and carefully to ensure that you do not wreck the cabinetry. The following are essential steps in effectively removing an old countertop:


Disconnect your plumbing. If your countertop is located in a kitchen, bathroom or utility area, you must ensure that you cannot have water leakage. Stop the water from its source.
Loosen the sink and other plumbing. You can use a putty knife and the help of a few friends. Remove these items when they are loosened.
Cut the caulk around the backsplash, if you have it. Use a utility knife to cleanly cut and strip away the caulk holding the backsplash in place. Place a putty knife next to the wall and use a crowbar to pry away the backsplash until it is removed.
Unscrew your countertop from the top, sides or underneath. Again, use a putty knife and crowbar (if necessary) to pry the countertop from the cabinetry. It is a good idea to have a number of people helping you so that you can do it gently and pull it away without dropping the counter or digging into the cabinets.;
, It will be far easier to take the dimensions once it is no longer connected to the cabinets. Take measurements of the width, length and depth before going to the hardware store.

, There are quite a few inexpensive options, but what makes sense for your home may be determined by the availability in your area.


Find reclaimed wood from a construction site or a construction recycling business. An old door will work as well. Find a piece of wood that is larger than your measurements, so that you can cut it down to size. You can also use several pieces and glue them together, as long as they are the same depth. Remember, if there are some imperfections, these can add to the charm of the wood, or it can be re-sanded in the refinishing process.
Find tongue and groove flooring from your local home improvement store. Many of these stores have sales every few months on wood that is overstocked. Buying enough tongue and groove flooring for a counter will be fairly inexpensive. If you choose to do this option, have the clerk calculate how much you will need based on your measurements. Also, you may want to leave your existing countertop in place and glue over the top, or install MDF or a thick plywood countertop in exact measurements before you use the flooring.
Order a piece of wood board from a hardware store. You can have a piece of wood in any type cut to the size you need at most home improvement stores. You will have the most control over what type of wood you want with this option, but it is likely to be more expensive if you choose a rare wood.
Choose a hard wood for this project. Soft wood will mark easily and be less durable over time. Ash, hard maple, cherry, mahogany, oak, walnut and teak are all hardwoods. Oak is the most common material for making furniture. Pine is a soft wood that is commonly used with furniture, but you may want to choose yellow pine over white pine if you are opting to use a softer wood.

, Cut it to size with a circular saw, if this has not already been done at the home improvement store. If you are using tongue and groove flooring, you will need to cut the boards to desired lengths, taking into account how they fit together.


With flooring, 1 of your boards may need to be cut lengthwise in order to achieve your desired counter width. You may choose to use this board at the back of the counter to hide the unfinished cut.

, Finish it with fine-grit sandpaper. This is also not necessary with the tongue and groove option.

, Liquid nails will work well for tongue and groove flooring and gluing together separate pieces of panel. It is important to glue the separate pieces of wood together, rather than gluing the board directly to the cabinets.

, Wipe away excess glue throughout the process with a clean cloth.

, Place heavy objects on top of the wood so that they do not bow while drying. Allow them to dry according to glue bottle directions.


Try to space your clamps out evenly. This will create an even hold in all areas.

, These small nails are usually applied with a hammer, but a nail gun can be used for larger projects. Make sure to space them at regular intervals, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.3 to 0.6cm) from the edge of the counter.

, This will also help to affix the stain. Wipe the surface with a tack cloth before staining.

, This is a water-based product sometimes called ""conditioner."" You will want to take extra time when finishing the countertop to ensure it is ready for use.

, You can apply it with a foam brush or a cloth. Repeat another coat once dry to achieve a darker color.

, Use between 2 and 5 coats, allowing it to dry according to the package directions.

Think about your partner’s feelings.,
Concentrate on positive outcomes.,
Know that talking about exes can help you know each other better.",How to Have a Healthy Conversation About Exes with Your Current Partner2," Being clear with one another about why you want to discuss exes is an important part of having a healthy conversation. If you are talking about past relationships to coerce your partner into a specific behavior, you should reevaluate why you are sharing that element of your past., Before you and your partner begin a conversation about exes, you should agree on some common ground rules. These rules will vary from couple to couple, but having rules in place will allow both partners to be open and honest while remaining comfortable., Once you decide on some basic ground rules, you can work together to agree what types of questions are appropriate to ask. For example, you might agree that it is okay to ask why you broke up with an ex or what you learned from the relationship. You might also decide that it is inappropriate to ask about an ex’s sexual performance or preferences

, Having a focused, candid conversation with your partner about past relationships can help build trust and encourage communication. Once you set ground rules about what, precisely, you will be discussing, make an effort to stick to the issues at hand.


For example, if you agree to discuss general overviews of past relationships, avoid going into details about your former mother-in-law.

, While it is important to be open and honest with your current partner while discussing exes, you should minimize the details. Providing your significant other with detailed accounts of past sex lives and relationship woes is unnecessary. Give details when necessary, but avoid lengthy narratives that might spark insecurity in your current partner.For example, you should avoid providing or asking about intimate details of your sex life with exes.

, When you’re discussing past relationships with your significant other, it’s important that you are honest with them. If you lie to your partner, you are missing a critical opportunity to build trust and practice open communication. While a detailed account of your past isn’t necessary, it’s important that you are honest and open.If your current partner asks why you broke up with your ex, you should provide them with an honest answer. You can say, for example, “He did not support my goal of returning to nursing school.”
If you feel uncomfortable answering a question, try saying, “Jim, I do not feel comfortable answering that question about my relationship with my ex, I would prefer to leave it in the past.”

, When you decide to have a conversation with your significant other about past relationships, it’s important to take the other person’s feelings into account. Talking about exes can make both parties feel vulnerable and it’s important to take this into consideration when you decide what you will or won’t be sharing.


For example, you should avoid discussing intimate details of past sex lives that might make your partner insecure.

, When talking about your ex, try and stay focused on what you learned from the relationship and how those lessons made you a better person. Breakups often fuel self-growth, and relaying this to your current partner can help them understand why you are the person you are today.For example, you could say, “While our breakup was messy, I really benefitted and grew from becoming financially independent and being able to pursue my own interests without constraint.”
Keep in mind that complaining about your ex may give people the impression that you are not over them. It can also take away the focus from your new developing relationship.

, When you talk with your partner about past relationships, both of you can gain insight into how the other person grew into who they are today. Relationships are learning experiences that test your needs and boundaries, and talking about them will help both of you better understand each other’s character, history, and behavior.For example, you might learn that your current partner was really hurt by his ex lying to him. This will help you understand that he values honesty in a relationship.
Or, your new partner might learn that your ex did not take your opinions into account. This could enhance his communication with you in this new relationship.

Locate an investment partner.,
Network actively.,

Take it one deal at a time.",How to Flip Houses With No Money2," The most common way for inexperienced house-flippers to enter the market is to find an investment partner. This is especially important for those who do not have the money for the down payment or initial repairs.An investment partner will supply some or all of the start-up cash in exchange for a share of the profits.You might consider finding a partner who has a great deal of liquid cash but no interest in doing the legwork for purchasing or refinishing a home. While your partner will supply the cash, you will supply the know-how and labor., In order to find an investment partner, you should develop a number of personal and professional contacts in your community. Spread the word that you are interested in undertaking an investment opportunity with a partner. Some ways that you can locate potential partners include:


Researching active real estate investors. Get in touch with successful, experienced real estate investors who might consider taking a chance on you.
Joining a Real Estate Investment Club. Many local communities have local chapters of real estate investment clubs. Once you join, you will have access to locals who might share your interests and enthusiasms.Joining a meetup group. Meetup groups are social clubs that sometimes have specific themes, including real estate. Use a meetup group to extend your social network.
Spreading the word among family and friends. Discuss your dream of flipping houses with those who are already in your social network, such as family, friends, and coworkers. They might be able to put you in touch with others who share your interests or who are looking to invest in real estate.
Creating your own real estate investment club. If your neighborhood does not yet have a real estate investors' club, you can form your own chapter.Advertise on Craigslist and through meetup websites in order to find like-minded individuals.

, When you enter into an investment partnership, it is important that you do not simply rely on verbal agreements. Make sure all transactions are reflected in a signed contract. Consult a business or real estate attorney to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the arrangement. Make sure you work out in advance:


Who covers which costs
How the profits will be split
Who will cover potential debts and liabilities
Who will undertake particular tasks (such as hiring contractors)
Note security laws that regulate promotion of investments as well as the possibility of investor lawsuits if events don't occur as planned

, Some real estate partnerships work spectacularly; others completely fail. Do not lock yourself into a partnership over the long term before you know how well you work with your partner. Instead, take it one house at a time, and evaluate whether your partnership has the potential to be a strong and lasting one.Take into account whether or not the financial return worked as expected.

Consider professional resurfacing.",How to Clean an Xbox Game Disc2," Since toothpaste is slightly abrasive, you can use it to polish off light scratches on the surface of your disc. Make sure that it is not a whitening or bleaching toothpaste, as these contain chemicals that can damage the disc.Baking soda toothpaste will give the best results. Avoid gel-based toothpastes.

, You don't need much, a little smaller than a pea should be sufficient.

, Just a drop or two should be enough, you want to be able to make a paste with the toothpaste, but not turn it too runny.

, If you're using your finger, make sure that you've cleaned it first to remove excess oils. Apply gentle pressure and rub back and forth over the scratch to polish it out.


Rub from the center towards the edge, not in a circular motion.

, Make sure that all of the excess toothpaste has been removed from the disc surface. Allow the disc to air dry after rinsing it off.

, If the scratches are too much for toothpaste to handle, your only other option may be professional resurfacing. This is usually a pretty expensive process, and if the game is older it may be cheaper to just buy a new copy.


Check your local used video game, music, or movie stores to see if they offer disc resurfacing services.

Locate the sink trap.,
Place a bucket underneath the sink trap.,
Unscrew the slip joint nuts.,
Remove the sink trap.,
Rinse the sink trap.,
Scrub the sink trap with a bottle brush.,
Reassemble the trap.",How to Clean a Sink Trap3," Look under your sink and locate a pipe with a J or P-like curve. This is your sink trap. The sink trap is located in between the tail pipe and the waste pipe.The tail pipe is the pipe that connects directly to your sink, and the waste pipe is the pipe that connects to the wall.

, You can use a regular gallon bucket, or any type of water collecting device like a dishpan. The bucket will be used to catch any water, dirt, and grime that comes out as you remove the sink trap., Begin by loosening the slip joint nuts on each end of the sink trap (on each end of the J or P). You can do this either manually, using your hands, or you can use a wrench. Once the joint nuts are loose, continue to untighten them with your hands.If your sink trap has a decorative or metal finish, then use a strap wrench to loosen the slip joints to prevent scratching. You can also place duct tape on the parts of the wrench that come into contact with your pipes to prevent scratching.

, As you remove the sink trap, make sure to locate the O-rings. There should be two; one on each side of the J. Place them somewhere safe. The O-rings are used to seal the connection between the sink trap and the tail and waste pipes.Also make sure to take note of the order the parts are in. This way you can reassemble the sink trap correctly.
Clog the waste pipe with a cloth or rag to prevent sewer gases from entering your home.

, Take the sink trap to a separate sink or outside to rinse. Rinse the trap thoroughly until all the loose dirt and grime are removed., You can also use a dishwashing detergent to remove any dirt and grime as you scrub the sink trap. Scrub the sink trap until all the dirt and grime are removed.At this point, you can use the bottle brush to scrub and remove any dirt and grime from the end of the tail pipe as well.

, Place the slip joint nuts onto the tail and waste pipes first. Slip the O-rings back onto the tail and waste pipes. Then place the sink trap between the tail and waste pipes. Use your hands to tighten the slip joint nuts over the ends of the sink trap.Use your wrench to finish tightening the slip joint nuts. Only tighten the slip joints nuts a quarter turn more. Try not to tighten them too tight. This can cause your pipes to crack and break, especially plastic ones.

Whenever you watch a movie where someone has ice powers, take a small glance at your hands for a second.",How to Pretend to Have Ice Powers," Every person who has ice powers has to know about the ice and snow and wintertime. Learn about how snow is formed, what snow crystals look like, and weather patterns in various parts of the world, especially where you live.;
, Start with ""The Snow Queen"" By Hans Christian Anderson, as this is what Frozen is based off of. The Snow Queen in this story has ice powers, and you could learn a lot from her.

, Watch Frozen or Rise of the Guardians, two great movies with characters with ice powers. Pay attention to how these powerful characters act, what they do and say, and especially how they like the cold. Some other characters with ice powers include Frozone from The Incredibles, the Ice King from Adventure Time, and Iceman from X-Men.

, Although bleaching your whole head is a viable option, it's not necessary. Instead, add a few white streaks or highlights here and there. Or you can just get some white hair extensions so you don't damage your hair.

, Have some winter jewelry like snowflake charms or other wintry patterns. You can wear necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, bows, or anything else that strikes your fancy - but take it easy; don't wear all these things at the same time or you'll look like you're trying too hard and people will be suspicious.

, Wear blues, whites, silvers, and maybe a little bit of black. You can wear normal colors too, but winter colors should form most of your wardrobe.


Wear casual and sometimes over-the-moon fancy outfits. For example, think of Frozen themed outfits. Wear casual blue or white long or occasionally short shirts. Wear sweaters in the shades blue, dark blue, light blue, and white. And for pants wear some long spandex or leggings in the colors black, blue, white, and gray.
Maybe use accessories such as a hood over your head, or a casual scarf.
Wear occasional fancy blue, or white dresses.


Wear this sort of gear often, according to the event and try to wear more dresses at home, so that you don't have to conceal your true ways.







, If you do, it'll look like the snow or cold doesn't affect you, which is true of people with ice powers. Or it will look like you have some power that keeps you warm and the cold out, which also suggests ice powers. Just make sure you're not shivering all the time - then, people will notice.

, Wear casual, wintry style, a little white or light blue and sometimes shimmery eyeshadow.


If you don't have blue eyes, consider wearing blue eye contacts. Every person with ice powers has blue eyes. They should be bright blue or ice blue, and if possible, they should have a snowflake pattern in the iris to be even more believable. This step is optional, especially if you hate the thought of sticking contacts in when you don't need them.

, Wear a nude lip, some mascara, with a bit of bronzer or darker blush to top it off. You can also cover up any blemishes with concealer.

, Just a little bit, to give some sheen. Don't do this if you're handling fabric or objects that will get stained.

, Just maybe hold your hand straight out at the faucet or cup of water or something when you know someone's about to walk in. Pretend to concentrate on what your freezing. At first, pretend that you don't see the person there, then say something like, ""It won't work!"" or ""Why can't I freeze this!?"" and then stare at the person in a shocked and slightly alarmed expression. Maybe tell them to not mention this to any living soul, and then quickly walk out of there and into your room before they can ask any questions.

, So when someone grabs your hands, they will feel cold. They may ask you why. Just say something like ""Oh! U-uh, no reason! No reason at all!"" Then walk away. Don't forget to reapply the eyeshadow onto the palms of your hands, if you had added any.

, Act aware whenever you hear someone say ""winter"" or ""snow"" or something like that. This will give the impression that you care a lot about winter and about what others think of it, which would be true if you really did have ice powers - you'd want to know what others thought of your creations.

, Act like the cold doesn't affect you. Don't take this overboard - there's no reason to spend all of your time in the snow with nothing but a bathing suit on. But spending a lot of your time in the snow and acting like it's nothing could help you convince others of your powers. If there's no snow, give the impression that it's always too hot - keep the air conditioning on and always leave the fans going.

, Like Elsa, you would be scared to hurt people with your powers, so you keep the people out of your life. Be reserved and introverted - this will also help give the impression that you don't want to spend lots of time with others because you have something to hide. Just don't ditch school or something like that.

, Your voice has to be as beautiful as winter itself. Avoid singing too much or people will think you're only trying to show others how good you are. Then, they'll start to ignore, avoid, and/or dislike you, and your prank won't work.

, And make sure people notice but don't look at them every time someone uses them or every second of the movie; otherwise they will know you're trying too hard and ignore you the rest of the movie."

See if you can trim non fixed expenses down by 5% or even 10%If you are in the habit of eating out at lunchtime, try making yourself lunch before work.
If you spend a lot at your local pub, try inviting your friends over for drinks more of the time to save on alcohol.;
, If you get a large tax refund from the government every year, you are basically loaning the government money without interest. Get your current employer to adjust your tax withholding amount, and place the savings into a savings account or an investment portfolio. You will be giving yourself a raise equal to the amount of interest you make on this money during the year., If you are currently in debt, the single best way to give yourself a raise is to get out of debt. The interest you are paying on your debt could be money in your pocket. If you can get out of debt, you will be giving yourself a raise equal to the amount of interest that you would otherwise be stuck paying., Review your monthly statement and look at all of your subscriptions. Looking carefully at all of your product and entertainment subscriptions such as cable or new subscriptions, consider cutting as many as possible. It is possible that you are spending a great deal of money on entertainment products that you no longer use.

See if you can find the same service from a different company for less money. If you identify a cheaper version of the service, try phoning your current provider to see if they will match the price or switch your service provider.


If you decide to switch service provider, you should check to see whether your current provider will penalize you with service withdrawal charges.

, If you spend a lot on vacations, try a stay-at-home vacation or staycation. Instead of spending a fortune on airplane tickets, stay at home for the holidays. The money you would have spent on the vacation will stay in your pocket as a small raise. On your staycation, you can go to a local museum, go see a show, or enjoy an afternoon with a favorite novel at your local café., If you are currently living on your own, you could save money on rent by getting a roommate or two. You will get to meet new people and save on rent, since it is cheaper to rent a shared apartment than rent one on your own. The money you save will be in your pocket at the end of each month. Depending on the city you live in, you could be giving yourself a raise of $500 to $1500 per month."

Give herbs.,
Give added value goodies such as preserves or sauces that you've made from your garden produce.,
Save seeds from your garden.,
Give flowers.,
Give compost gifts.",How to Give Gifts from the Garden," Fresh herbs are loved by many people, especially those who enjoy cooking and growing their own food. There are several possible ideas here:

Snip off a large bunch of fresh herbs, tie a rubber band around them and a ribbon, and give the fresh bundle to someone as a gift.



 


Grow live herbs to give to people. Be sure to use gift-worthy potting containers.






Dry your herbs and give the sprig of herbs as a gift. Be sure to label and if you like, add the culinary uses for each herb to the label. You might like to give the dried herbs as a bundle or already added to little containers.





;
, The sorts of things to make include:


Jams or jelies
Preserves
Chutneys
Sauces
Pickles
Syrups
Candied flowers

, Place seeds into homemade seed packets, label them using your printer or calligraphy hand and let the receiver know that they're seeds straight from your garden. These can be wonderful family heirloom seed sharing opportunities, or you can give seeds to neighbours, as a housewarming gift, or as a way to remind people to plant their own veggie garden.

, As with the herbs, you can choose to give cut flowers in a bunch or give a living flower in a suitable container. When cutting them for a bunch, choose the best flowers and add flair with a ribbon or bow. Making a posy adds special value to the gift.


All flowers can make wonderful gifts, from roses to daisies. Be sure to select the ones that are growing strongest when giving them as gifts to be planted in someone else's garden.

, Why not offer another keen gardener some of your delightful homemade compost, especially where they haven't had a chance to make any? You might also consider making them some compost tea and placing it in a bottle for ready fertilising. Always label clearly and clear the compost delivery with the recipient first!

Eat well.,
Don't stress.,
Exercise regularly.,
Take vitamins and supplements.",How to Grow Your Hair Naturally2," We don't always make the connection between eating right and hair growth but that relationship is there, whether we like it or not. Eating well and getting the right nutrients in your body will help your total health, including helping your hair to grow quicker and thicker.


Foods that are high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids will help your hair to grow quicker and thicker. Some examples of these types of food are nuts and lean fish, such as salmon. You may also want to incorporate more iron and zinc into your diet. This will help with hair follicle growth.If you have a hard time incorporating foods with a lot of iron into your diet, such as red meat, consult your doctor to see if a dietary supplement might be appropriate for you.

, Getting stressed out doesn't help any of your body systems, and even you hair can be affected. In extreme cases, stress can cause you to lose hair, in less extreme cases, it can simply lesson the productivity of body systems, such as hair growth.There are a wide variety of ways to destress or to avoid stress in the first place but each method is highly individualized.


Take time in your day to destress. It doesn't matter how you do it, whether yoga, stretching, meditation, or a nice long walk, but what matters is that you take the time to calm your mind and body from the stress of the day.
Avoid situations that are stressful, if you can. While no one can avoid stress at all times, there are situations we get ourselves into that we could avoid and that we know will be stressful before we even get ourselves into them. If you can avoid these situations, do it! It will help both your mental and physical health.

, Regular exercise promotes good circulation and overall health. This in turn helps your hair follicles to produce stronger thicker hair.Exercise helps you to destress and to produce good hormones and high levels of blood flow.These outcomes are key to healthy hair growth.

, Certain vitamin deficiencies can lead to less hair growth, as well as dry, brittle hair. Fish oil supplements and B vitamins, such as biotin, can help promote the growth of hair.While there is not scientific evidence to prove it's true, some people find that taking prenatal vitamins will help speed up hair, thickening it dramatically.The extra boost of a variety of vitamins and minerals supposedly helps promote the growth of a fetus also add to hair follicle production.
Buy a supplement that promotes hair growth specifically.There are a wide variety of products on the market.

Give them their own water cups, and have them refilled often.,
Talk about junk food.,
Encourage their self-esteem.",How to Help Your Child Manage Their Weight," It's natural to spend time in front of the TV, and get fast food sometimes, but don't allow it to become a family habit. This is bad for all of you.


When you want them out of your hair, bring out some cool toys or library books. Leave TV for special occasions, or only certain times of the day.
If you don't have time to cook, buy healthy microwaveable meals rather than constant fast food.;
, Keep healthy foods in your fridge and pantry, for both mealtimes and snacks. Talk about maintaining a balanced diet as a goal (not cutting out all fat), and about eating sweets in moderation.


Let them see you eating healthy foods.
Avoid controlling your child too much, or they will binge-eat when you aren't looking. This can lead to serious health problems.
Stay away from fad diets, diets that limit your food groups, or strict diets in general. If you constantly talk about controlling your weight, your child will learn that body fat and sweets are something to feel guilty about, leading to unhealthy behavior.

, Social children may enjoy team sports, and you can help them find out an activity that they enjoy attending. If they dislike it, allow them to quit, so they don't associate exercise with negative feelings.

, Some children may dislike the competitive or highly social nature of sports, and that's okay—it's more important that they learn that exercise is fun.


Play backyard sports as a family, without keeping score.
Make sports a collaborative effort: work together to make baskets, pass a ball around, or practice hitting a baseball.
Keep outdoor toys and sports equipment easily accessible, so they can run out and play whenever they like.
Try incorporating walks and hikes into the family routine.

, It's important that all children have a healthy attitude towards food.


Fill up between 1/3 to 1/2 of their plate with fruits and vegetables.
Encourage them to snack if they feel hungry.
Explain the importance of only eating when they are hungry.

, Take them with you down the fruits and vegetables section of the grocery store, and ask them to choose some foods for you to make. If your kids have a say in what healthy foods come home, they are more likely to eat those foods.

, Chubby children may feel ashamed about their weight, causing them to hesitate to exercise and not take good care of their bodies. Don't let this happen. Tell them that they can be strong and active people, and that their body is not a hindrance.


Expose them to pictures of fat athletes and fat children exercising and having fun.
Never criticize or make fun of people for being fat.
Love your body, and let your children see you loving your body. They will copy you.
Limit their exposure to magazines and TV, as these feature overly-thin casts and may lead to diminished self esteem.

, Hydration will help them stay energetic and healthy. The water cups can come with you in the car, at the table, and at their desks.


Go to the water bottle section of a store. Have them pick out a reusable cup in their favorite color, possibly with cartoon characters on it. This will help make it feel like it's theirs.
Young children, or children who have poor motor skills, may need a sippy cup to avoid spills.
Add a silly straw to make it more fun and easy to drink from.

, Explain that everyone eats some, and that it's perfectly okay as long as you eat it in moderation. Allow them to have a small/moderate amount at a certain time period (e.g. cookies for a bedtime snack). Let them know that it's nothing to be ashamed of.


If one sibling is thinner, do not give them more junk food than their chubbier sibling(s). This will upset them and make the chubbier sibling(s) feel that they deserve more too.
If your child is sneaking junk food, make healthy snacks more available, especially ones with healthier fats (e.g. nuts and peanut butter). Talk to them if secretive eating becomes a problem.
Never let them see you being guilty about food. Eat dessert and enjoy it!

, Don't make your praise contingent upon lost weight—teach them to always love themselves as they are. When they love their bodies, they'll take good care of them, whatever their weight may be.


When you go shopping with your daughter, help her pick out a cute swimsuit. Praise how adorable she looks, and gently joke about fending off boys at the swimming pool. This will help her learn that it's okay to swim in public.
Never utter the word ""slimming"" when it comes to finding clothes. It teaches children that their body is something to be minimized. Let them have fun with their wardrobe.
Cultivate inner beauty.

Specialize as a specific kind of loan officer.,

Continue to learn.",How to Be a Loan Officer," Before deciding that being a loan officer is the right job for you, learn about the field using online resources, especially those that specialize in jobs like Bureau of Labor Statistics at http://www.bls.gov/ Loan officers assist people with loan applications for cars, home, and college tuition, helping to determine the best available loan and to make them aware of the various requirements. Although most work for banks or other credit and financial institutions, some work independently with clients and businesses.Your duties as a loan officer will include processing applications, making sure that the information is complete and accurate. Analyzing the data, you will determine if a client is credit-worthy, whether to grant a loan, and, if so, under what conditions the loan will be made.Some loan officers are highly specialized. They can deal in consumer loans to people, commercial loans to businesses, mortgage loans for real estate, or in loan collection. Some loan officers also travel extensively to meet with clients at businesses or homes.The average salary for loan officers in 2012 was $59,280. Some are paid a regular salary while others are paid on commission, with the volume of clients depending on the overall strength of the economy. Many mortgage loan officers must also work long hours.;
, While most loan officers hold a college degree, it is still possible to become one with only a high school education and on-the-job training. You will need a high school diploma at the very least, however. If you are trying to enter the field, then, make sure to complete your secondary schooling, taking any math, economics, business, and computer classes available to you. These courses will come in handy for further education and for your duties at work., Especially for more complex commercial loans, employers will require officers to hold college degrees in finance, economics, business, or a closely related subject. Plan to complete a bachelor’s degree in one of these fields, as it will give you the tools needed to analyze finances, read a financial statement, and understand the basics of business accounting and cash flow analysis.Take courses in subjects like accounting, mathematics, economics, and business statistics. An increasing number of financial institutions are now using underwriting software, so it is also useful to be proficient with computers and financial software., Because they work so closely with clients, employers favor loan officers with sales skills, self-confidence, and strong interpersonal communication.Work hard to build your skills in these areas.


Mortgage lenders need to form relationships with real estate developers, builders, and agents to increase their referrals, for example. In some instances, you might even be contacting businesses to encourage loan applications. As an effective loan officer you must also be able to answer customers’ questions clearly and to guide them through the application process.
Take advantage of offerings in school to cultivate the right skill set. Courses in psychology, public speaking, and communication can all help.Practice public speaking. You won’t be giving speeches as a loan officer, but you’ll be talking to clients and need plenty of self-confidence. Public speaking does just that. Spend some time every week in front of a mirror. Give a sales pitch, for example. Assess and repeat. You can also join an organization like Toastmasters International for more feedback., Many banks like to hire loan officers with a prior background in the industry, especially if the employee doesn’t have a college degree. Some look for as much as five or more years of experience, or an equivalent in a related field.You will want to get as much experience as possible in banking. However, an aspiring loan officer can also gain the needed experience in related fields like customer service or sales.Keep in mind that banks usually provide some kind of on-the-job training to loan officers. If hired, you will probably have to complete a mix of company-sponsored instruction and a few months of informal training., Some loan officers work a normal, salaried 40-hour week, but many do not. Your schedule as a loan officer will most likely depend on several factors. For one, demand for loans is higher in good economic times and when interest rates are low. If you are working on commission, you may find that, when interest rates rise, you have to put in much longer hours to make ends meet.In general, loan officers work very flexible schedules. Mortgage officers may have to work at night or be willing to take calls at all hours. Commercial loan officers may also travel to arrange loan agreements., At some point you will take the plunge and apply. Keep your eyes open for positions. If you are already in banking, let colleagues know that you are interested in moving into loans. You may find an opening at your current job or be able to arrange an internal transfer. If not, check listings online on websites like Linkedin or in your newspaper’s classified section. Most of the jobs in the industry will appear at places like banks, credit unions, or lending institutions.


Another option is to become an “independent loan originator.” This basically means that you are a self-employed loan officer. Do not think that is an easy way to go. To become one you will still need to meet all the usual education and licensing standards and register with the Federal Housing Administration. You will also need to get insurance as an independent broker, to protect yourself against mistakes., Loan officers are usually one of three kinds, working in consumer, commercial, or mortgage loans. How you specialize may largely depend on the institution that you work for. Some banks do more commercial lending than others, for example. However, cutting a niche for yourself will focus your skills on a particular expertise.Consumer loans are made to individuals. Think of these as “everyday loans.” A commercial loan officer works with regular bank customers to cover things like auto loans, education loans, or home renovation or improvement loans. Working with cover things like education and home equity loans.
Commercial loan officers work specifically with businesses. A commercial loan officers helps such organizations to underwrite costs like new inventory or equipment or even to expand their business.
The third kind of officer, mortgage officers, work with prospective real estate buyers. As a mortgage loan officer you will be more or less working entirely with individuals who need to take out loans in order to finance houses, purchase property, or to refinance existing mortgages.

, In the United States, the federal government requires that all mortgage loan officers have a license. If you decide to specialize in mortgages, then, you will need to complete at least 20 hours of course work, pass an exam, and undergo a background and credit check.Be aware that, in addition to federal requirements, laws vary by state. In New York State, for example, you must complete 20 hours of pre-licensing education that includes 3 hours on state-specific law, as well as 11 hours of continuing education years (with at least 3 hours of state-specific instruction)., The American Bankers Association and the Mortgage Bankers Association both offer ongoing training and certification programs for loan officers. Legally, you don’t need to be certified. But these programs will boost your credentials and chances of advancing. You’ll take a series of courses to improve your knowledge of banking, credit analysis, and mortgage law. You can even choose a program that is designed for your loan specialization.For example, a loan officer can earn a residential or commercial Certified Mortgage Banker (CMB) certificate through the Mortgage Bankers Association.The American Banker's Association offers certificates in Commercial Lending,Residential Mortgage Lending,and another in Lending Compliance., Pursuing your professional development with a certification course in underwriting will, once again, increase your credentials and potential for advancement. Underwriting programs are designed for those already in the industry; you will take courses that improve your understanding of loan risk based on things like property types and value, capital, and debt. Two or even four-year degree programs are also available.One skill that underwriting programs will give you is software literacy. While some banks still judge loan applications by set guidelines and human judgement, increasingly they are use specialized underwriting software that evaluates loan applicant. Knowing your way around these programs is a great skill to put on your resume., You will have to do a lot of professional development to be a great loan officer. Laws change often at the state and federal level. You will have to stay on top of these changes. Also, remember that you will need to complete a minimum amount of continuing education hours per year to maintain your license. Whether it be for certification, staying up-to-date, or just continuing education, it's in your interest to keep learning.

Pronounce your words clearly.,
Speak more softly.",How to Speak Nicely1," People range in their ability to hear and understand language, and you have a greater chance of being heard and understood when you speak clearly. Practice with a recorder or ask a friend to help you learn to pronounce your words with more clarity. Things that can help include slowing down, lowering the tone of your voice, listening to and borrowing from actors whose accent or tone you like, etc.


Avoid using a monotone (no variances in your speech). This suggests that you don't have confidence in what you're saying and it tends to bore people after a short time.
Avoid mumbling. People feel very embarrassed when they continually fail to ""catch"" what is being said and will soon find and excuse to get away from someone who is mumbling a lot. If you mumble as a result of shyness, it's important to address this cause; for example, see How to overcome shyness.;
, Try to tone down any hint of aggression or loudness in your voice when talking to others. Loudness causes people to be on the alert and even on the defensive, and can set them on edge. As for aggressiveness coming through the voice, few people will miss this intent and will feel very uncomfortable.

Choose a bundle of ribbons for making into a necklace.,
Decide on the length for the necklace.,
Start knotting lengths of ribbon together.,
Continue making as many lengths as you would like to form the necklace.,
When you've made enough lengths, draw them together, end to end.,
Wear.",How to Make a Knotted Ribbon Necklace2," The colors and patterns can be random and eclectic, or you can be very careful and match colors according to a pattern or theme, such as varying shades of purple or green, or rainbow hues, or ribbons with spots, etc. You'll need quite a few ribbons, but the exact amount will depend on how bulky you'd like the final necklace to appear.


The ribbons can be in all sorts of lengths, as you'll be knotting them together to create the desired lengths. One thing that is important is that you must be prepared to cut the ribbons used, in order to ensure a nice mix of different ribbon lengths.

, This will determine how long each knotted ribbon length will need to be.


To work out the length, get a piece of string and hold it around your neck. Stand in front of the mirror and keep moving the string length until it is of the length you desire, then this string forms your length template.
Just be sure to add a small amount extra for making the end loop when the lengths are joined together.

, Choose differing lengths and colors or patterns of ribbon and begin knotting them together to make the length that you've chosen for the necklace.

, It's recommended that you make at least five lengths, so that there are enough lengths for the necklace to look interesting. You can have many more lengths, as wished.

, At one end, tie in a neat loop and knot, joining the ends together permanently. On the other end, stitch a large button to the other end, layered one on top of the other. The stitches will keep this end intact.


The button must be large enough to not fall back through the loop but not so large that it doesn't fit through the loop with a bit of a push.

, To wear, bring the necklace together around your neck and put the button through the loop to hold it in place.

Unsubscribe from junk mail.,
Buy less overall.,
Donate old items.,
Have a yard sale.",How to Reduce Household Waste2," In our society, it's tempting to just throw out items when they break. However, if you're trying to reduce waste, try to repair the items instead. That way, you aren't just throwing it in the landfill. For instance, if the sole comes off your boot, take it to a cobbler instead of just throwing it out. If your television has a problem, get it repaired instead of going out to buy a new one. As an added bonus, repairs are usually cheaper than buying a new item., Instead of purchasing throwaway items like paper plates, plastic zip top bags, and one-time use batteries, opt for reusable items. Depend on washable plates and reusable containers and bags. Invest in rechargeable batteries so you're not always throwing them away. As an added bonus, this tip will save you money in the long term., Plastic grocery bags seem to multiply, particularly if you go shopping often. Of course, you may reuse some of them in your house, but you likely throw away a good number, too. The best solution is to bring reusable cloth grocery bags with you to the store. In addition to being reusable, they hold more than plastic bags, and they are less likely to bust on you.Store your canvas bags in your car or leave them hanging right beside your door as a reminder to use them.

, If you're like most people, you receive a large amount of mail that goes directly into the trash. Take steps to reduce that mail. You can call catalog companies and ask to be taken off the list, for instance, if you're not interested in seeing the catalog.You can also use websites like https://www.catalogchoice.org/ and https://dmachoice.thedma.org/ to cancel junk mail. The site https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t will let you opt out of credit card offers.

, In a consumerist society, you may feel the need to buy, buy, buy. However, the next time you're eyeing that new thing you want to buy, step back and ask yourself, ""Do I really need this?"" More often than not, the answer will be, ""No.""Before you buy, think about if you own something that could serve the same purpose. You may be able to repurpose something you already have to fill a need.
It also helps to avoid temptation by taking fewer trips to the store.

, When you're not using something anymore, try to find a place to donate it. Furniture, clothes, and other household items can be donated to thrift stores. Old books and magazines can be donated to libraries or schools. Donating items will help you reduce the trash you produce., If you hate to just give something away (after all, you paid good money for it), consider holding a yard sale instead. You likely won't pull in the big bucks, but you can make a little cash and clean out items from your house at the same time. Plus, you can donate anything you have leftover.Advertise your yard sale online or in the newspaper to increase attendance.
Spring and early summer, when it’s warm but not too hot, are excellent seasons for yard sales."

You should roll your windows down and turn your fan on high to allow circulation., Shovel Snow or arrange other materials along the sides of the vehicle to block as much of the open space between the ground and sides of the vehicle as possible. The objective is to give the heat created by the engine a path to the rear of the vehicle where most of the parking brake components are located., Wait outside the vehicle while it is running. You want to allow the engine time to warm up and produce the heat necessary to melt any ice underneath the car.

, If still frozen, allow more time for thawing and/or block open spaces at the front and rear of the vehicle, too (this is particularly helpful if it is gusty or windy). Pushing down the accelerator slightly will increase heat by working the engine harder.


Leave your door open while pressing the accelerator and then get back out of the car. If you have any exhaust issues at all, or have the exhaust blocked off, you run the risk of filling the car with carbon monoxide. This can be deadly.

, Once the ice has thawed, you can remove the walls that you created to block the underside the car., Leave your windows down and your fan on high and allow the cab to displace any possible carbon monoxide buildup before sitting in the cab or driving. Again, carbon monoxide is deadly."

Replacement front glass. You can buy one from eBay for a low price.
Flat, thin plastic tools you can use to prop the glass up.
Hair dryer.
Thin gloves, like those made of rubber or leather.
Box cutter.
Painter’s tape.;
, Just press the Power button until the screen turns off., This helps minimize the number of shards left on the touchscreen when removing the glass screen.

If you have a screen protector installed, you do not have to do this step as the protector has enough adhesive material on it to grab the shards.

, Remove also the microSD and SIM card.

Remember to store these items safely so they don’t inadvertently end up in the trash with the discarded tape and glass shards.

, With a hair dryer, constantly heat the bottom panel, where the Home button and capacitive touch buttons are located. While heating, try to pry the corners open with the box cutter. Carefully lift the edges off until all of the front panel is removed.

You will need to heat the sides and top of the front panel as well, as the glue that holds the glass in place is spread on those areas. Heat the surface of the front of the phone to 170–180 °F (82 °C) while making sure to hold the gun three inches away from the phone.
Also, if the glass is shattered, you have to be careful in lifting the large pieces away as it might scratch the AMOLED glass. Lift the pieces slowly and patiently, as rushing might cause damage to the digitizer and touch screen.

, Once the larger glass pieces has been lifted off, use painter’s tape to take out tiny shards of glass.

DO NOT touch the bare screen with your hands, even with gloves. It will leave hard-to-remove marks and will be visible when the screen is off.

, Do so starting from the edges of the front panel, and using a plastic pry tool and some guitar picks to wedge underneath the glass so it doesn’t slide back in., As you do, make sure that you have completely lifted the glass off of the LCD before you proceed lower. Leave guitar picks or prying tools wedged on the edges to prevent the glass from bonding with the LCD again., Remember that these are touch buttons at the bottom that have sensitive cables attached to them, so when you reach the bottom, do not pull the glass off just yet. Detach the buttons from the front panel by using a little heat, and use a spudger to peel the buttons off of the glass panel.

Start taking the buttons out by beginning with the middle black ribbon in the portion that connects the two buttons. Move sideways to remove each button.

, Once the buttons are unhinged, you can start removing the glass as well as the shards on the screen. If the shattered pieces are very fine, use some sticky tape to gently lift them off of the LCD screen. Do not press hard when doing this, as you can permanently scratch the LCD screen., You will be needing it for the new one., Use some WD40 and microfiber cloth, but do not use WD40 excessively., The double-sided tape should come with the front panel replacement when you purchased it., Make sure it is spotless before applying the new glass., Inspect it in the light for inconsistencies or blemishes that you should wipe off before applying.

Peel off the paper on the strips of sticker tape on the phone, and peel out the protective plastic on the surfaces of the replacement screen.

, Make sure to secure it properly.,, Make sure everything is dust free before doing so. Apply pressure on the edges of the screen to make them adhere securely while lining up the buttons to the appropriate areas while applying the glass.

You can use a small flathead screwdriver to secure the touch buttons (Back and Menu buttons) ribbons to the right position when laying the bottom of the panel down.

Be confident.,
Practice strong body language to intimidate those around you.,
Stare someone down by not breaking eye contact.,
Show you are in control.,
Be assertive with a confident voice.,
Be alert.,
Stay in a group of friends.",How to Defend Yourself and Make People Afraid of You1," Bullies are much less likely to attack you if they see you are confident. By walking, talking, and carrying yourself with poise, you will show others that you are not one to be messed with., When you stand tall, with your shoulders back and chin up, it shows that you are confident and won't let anyone bother you. Keep your arms loose by your side, uncrossed, and in front of you.Don't fidget with your hands or face because it translates as nervousness to others. Keep your hands and arms calm, and by your side, to look confident and in control.
Do not slouch when you sit or stand.

, When you meet eyes with someone, do not be the first person to look away because it shows weakness. Continue to look into their eyes until they either pass by you, or look away first. This will let people know that you are strong and confident, and it will leave them intimidated.


When meeting eyes with someone, do not smile. Instead, keep a straight face to show you are not trying to be friendly or welcoming.
To exhibit a threatening look, try scowling at someone by squinting your eyes and scrunching your eyebrows.

, Stay calm and do not let anyone tell you what to do. If a bully is trying to make you do something, or get you angry, don't follow order and don't show face. Instead, stay calm and speak up for yourself. This will make the bully feel ineffective and weak because you are excerpting your self-control and confidence., If you are in a potential bullying situation, speak up with a strong voice and be assertive to show that you are going to stand up for yourself. When bullies see you are not going to stand weakly and take any nonsense, they will go search for someone who is weak to mess with.You will eventually gain a reputation that lets people know that you are too strong to be targeted.

, As with anything, prevention is better than a solution. You can prevent a lot of conflict by being aware of your surroundings. Bullies often target people who seem to be unaware of their surrounds. If you walk around looking down, or distracted, a bully will see you as a good target. Always keep your head up, and scan your surroundings.

, It is harder for bullies to threaten or intimidate you when you put yourself in a group. When you are in the halls, or out on the playground, don't stand alone. The less vulnerable you are, the less likely it is somewhere will target you.


If you don't have a group of friends to stand by, stay in an area where there are a lot of people playing or hanging out.

Say hello.,
Be ready to listen.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Talk to strangers daily.",How to Become Friends With a Stranger1," The quickest and surest way to befriend someone you don’t know is to simply say hello. Approach a stranger that has caught your attention and say something along the lines of, “Hey, how’s the day going so far?” This alone can get a friendly conversation going. It will likely work best in a environments where social interaction is commonly expected.Most public places are usually fair game to approach someone and say hello. That said, be respectful. Avoid interrupting what looks to be a family meal, and don't bother someone who seems to be focused on work at the library.
In some contexts, it may be best to first increase your proximity to those you’re interested. For instance, join a group conversation and listen in on an ongoing conversation. This will give you the opportunity to jump in and introduce yourself.
Be sure to introduce yourself and ask for names. A quick, “Hey, I’m Derek, what’s your name?” is usually sufficient. Save your elevator pitch for networking events. You’re not going to make friends by telling everyone your business aspirations before allowing them to speak.;
, Often, people reach out to one another because they assume or hope that there will be a particular outcome. It can be challenging to keep our assumptions about someone from affecting how you interact with them. To help, focus on listening closely to people you’ve just met, as this will help you get an accurate perspective on who they are quickly.You’re more likely to find yourself in a budding friendship if you spend more time listening to someone than waiting for them to fulfill your assumptions about them.

, If you run into someone that does not warmly receive a friendly “Hello,” don’t let this wreck your day. Remind yourself that most people are excited when someone breaks the ice. In short, don’t get jaded by someone who is terminally antisocial.


When someone turns a cold shoulder to your attempts to start a conversation, note that whatever reason they have for doing so has nothing to do with you. They don’t know you, and they may have just missed their chance. Reach out to someone else instead., Plenty of people are hesitant, if not fearful, of introducing themselves to strangers. The best way to get over this shyness is to ignore it. While it may feel awkward, fight through your resistance and make a point of introducing yourself to someone you don’t know every day.This may be easier in places where you are comfortable. For instance, introduce yourself to someone in your apartment building or at the gym you go to. You already have something to ask about, such as, “Hey, which floor do you live on?” or “What routine did you start with to build biceps like that!?”
Worst case scenario: someone isn’t interested in talking, and you leave them alone. You can handle that.

Look for the ENERGY STAR® label.,
Selecting an energy efficient dishwasher.,
Choosing an energy efficient clothes washer.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs3," If you’re on the market for a new dishwasher or clothes washer, opt for one that is labeled as energy efficient. These machines will immediately reduce your water-heating costs. For instance, replacing a 10-yr old clothes washer can save you well over $100 a year. Similarly, an energy efficient dishwasher will use much less energy overall, reducing not only your water heating costs but your electricity costs as well., EnergyGuide labeling, which will project the expected annual cost of operating the washer, cannot be relied upon entirely. This is in part because smaller dishwashers, such as “compact” options, will be scored as more energy efficient, but will also wash less dishes per load. If you live in a multi-person home, a full capacity dishwasher is likely a better option.Choose an option with a booster heater. This feature heats water as it enters the machine. This is important because high water temperature is better for washing dishes. Ultimately, a booster heater allows you to keep the temperature on your water heater’s tank at an energy efficient level, and still clean your dishes effectively.
Choose an option with different wash cycle options. The ability to choose shorter cycles to wash dishes that require less cleaning will allow you to save water and water heating costs.

, An energy efficient clothes washer will cost about three times less to operate than a traditional washer. Generally, front-loading washing machines will use less water. Opt for a machine that allows you to select water temperatures for each cycle, and use cold water whenever possible. Always use cold water to rinse.Again, smaller models will have better EnergyGuide ratings, though a full-size option is better if it means running less loads.

Set SMART goals.,
Develop a personal mantra or motto.,
Find music that motivates you.,
Analyze your role model.,
Expect setbacks.",How to Overcome Your Problems when Everybody Is Against You1," Specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, time-bound (SMART) goals are the best way to success. This method of setting goals allows you to define a goal that can be reached in a way that you can measure your progress and success over a period of time. Once you have set your goal, go through each letter of the SMART acronym:Is this goal specific? Can it be more specific? Instead of saying “I will do well in school,” you should say “I will achieve a 3.0 this semester.”
How will I measure success? In the example above, success will be measured by your GPA.
Is my goal attainable? Are the resources needed available? - Do you have the books and other resources you need?
Is my goal realistic? Can it be achieved in the way that I propose? Are your grades currently at a place where a 3.0 is possible to attain?
Have I given myself an appropriate amount of time for this goal? If you set this goal in the last week of the semester, it might not be a reasonable amount of time. You should set such a goal in the beginning of the semester, giving you the entire semester to work on the goal.;
, To develop a motto or mantra to drive you toward success, you should consider your core values. What are the most important qualities and concepts in your life? Which ones will help you attain your current goals?Once you have your SMART goal set, you can use it to develop your motto. To use your motto or mantra, repeat it to yourself often (especially when your motivation needs a boost).Using the 3.0 goal above and noting that academic support is an important concept in your life, you might develop a motto such as “Go to class, don’t slack.”

, It is important to listen to music that you can identify with. Make sure that you identify with a positive, motivating message in your music. Music has the power to alter your mood and attitude in a way that few things do. If you do not identify with the music you listen to, try browsing the internet and trying different genres and playlists developed by others. These can easily be found places like Pandora and YouTube., It is often very helpful to have someone to emulate. It does not matter if your role model is your father, or your favorite superhero. Identify the things about that person that you admire and try to emulate them. Use these positive traits to propel yourself toward overcoming your problems on your own., One common mistake that people make is expecting to overcome their problems with no problems. This is not usually the case, especially with the added obstacle of having little or no support. Learn from your setbacks and keep pushing forward."

Track your credit utilization.,
Make purchases where you have a card.,
Use the card responsibly.,
Make regular payments.,
Build your credit.,
Look for other rewards cards.",How to Use Retail Store and Gas Credit Cards3," Because they tend to have low credit limits, gas and retail store credit cards can raise your credit utilization rate, which can hurt your credit score. You can calculate your credit utilization rate by dividing the amount of credit card debt you have by your cards’ credit limits. A high percentage is going to hurt your credit score. A good credit utilization rate is below 20 to 30 percent.For example, if your credit limit on a gas or store card is $500 and you put $300 on it, your credit utilization score is 60 percent, which is high.

, Most retail and gas cards only work at the corresponding store or gas station. Others will only award you the benefits of the card if you make purchases at the corresponding business. Because of this, you should try to spend your money at the establishments where you have a credit card in order to maximize its benefits.For example, if you have a gas card through Shell, you should make an effort to purchase gas at Shell gas stations.

, Like any credit card, it is important that you maintain your regular spending habits with a gas or retail store credit card. Many people rack up a lot of debt because they want to reap a card’s rewards. It is important that you resist this urge and try to stick to your normal spending habits.At a retail store, you should avoid making out-of-the-ordinary purchases, like buying expensive items that you have not budgeted for.
With a gas card, avoid buying junk food and other items at the gas station, which can add up quickly.

, Be sure to make your credit card payments each month. To avoid any late fees, be sure to make your payments by the due date. Ideally, you should pay off your card’s balance each month and avoid interest payments. If you cannot afford that, you should still try to pay more than the minimum each month.Because these cards tend to have high interest rates, paying the interest will likely negate the benefits of having the card in the first place.

, Because store and gas cards are easy to obtain for people with low or no credit, they are a good way to build up your credit score. As long as you make your monthly payments and avoid putting any large purchases on the card, you can gradually build up your credit score. However, if you fail to use the card responsibly, you can easily hurt your score., If you qualify, a regular credit card with a good rewards program might be a better option than a store or gas card. Because regular credit cards tend to have better rewards systems and larger lines of credit, you get more with each purchase and are less likely to hurt your credit score. Also, a regular card will give you more flexibility when making purchases since it does not limit you to one store or station.For example, with gas, there are certain cards that give you extra rewards when you buy gas and make purchases at gas stations."

Just like when you walk in the door of a social event, you want to get a feel for the place and how the people are interacting. You can tell from the comment conversations if these people will be ones you can relate to or not.Some online communities require that you sign up before you can read the boards or comments. You can do a little research about websites by reading reviews or reading on the website itself to see if you think it would be a good match for your personality.;
, Once you’re signed up on a website, it’s time to find users you think might make good friends for you. The easiest place to start is identifying others who share your interests. If you see a comment someone left about how much they love soccer or baking, and you love that thing too, you may want to pursue friendship with that person.


You can contact them immediately using the methods the website provides (such as clicking on their username to open a chat, or clicking “new message” by their name).
You can also copy and paste their name somewhere on your computer (or write it down) so that you can message them later when you feel more comfortable.

, Even though you’ll likely want to join more than one website—which means you’ll be setting up several user accounts—you want to be able to remember them all. Creating a username that you can use across all the websites is useful for this. You may have to tweak the name for different sites, but in general the similar name will prevent you from getting confused.

If a website already has a user with the name you picked out, adding a number, letter, or special character can usually allow you to still the use the name. For example, myrajane might be in use, but myra_jane might be available.
Use a different password for each site to protect your identity.
Create a file on your computer (such as Word or Excel) and save all the username/password combinations so that you don’t have to keep resetting the password.

, In addition to private-messaging (PMing) users you think you’d get along with, you can start commenting on threads already present. This way others will see your interests and may contact you first.

Make intelligent, unbiased comments so that you garner favor among commenters. Jumping in with a strong opinion or judgmental comment will most likely polarize the other commenters and contribute to your bad reputation on that site.

, Some online communities have introduction message boards. You can type up a couple of brief paragraphs with your name, location (just your city or state, nothing specific), age, gender, and a few interests. This information will provide a way for other users to connect with you. For example, someone from the same city or age group may be excited to contact you.

You can also find other users with your interests by scanning this board.

, If you want to start relationships with users who have specific interests, but you don’t want the bias already present on other message boards, starting your own group or message board might be the way to go. You can attract other users to join this group by commenting about it on similar threads.

, An easy way to make friends is to play online video games. A lot of online games today have a vocal component, so that you are playing the game and talking to other users at the same time. You can build relationships verbally rather than via text through games like Minecraft, Call of Duty, and many more.

Since you can join teams in video games, this often contributes to the creation of tighter bonds because you are working together toward a common goal.
Be aware that starting your own team and recruiting people to join it might create hostility in a game, so try to wait until people are interested and agreeable before starting your new team.

, Maintaining the norm for typing helps people like you since this standard is widely understood, even internationally. Using all caps, or a mix of uppercase and lowercase, or fancy scripts, is difficult to read and makes you seem pretentious or needy if no one else is doing this.

This can make it look like you are trying to draw attention to yourself, which works online just as it does in person: it usually pushes people away. This is because it suggests that you are unable to take care of yourself.Avoid “text talk” like using numbers to abbreviate a word (l8er, for example) as it appears unprofessional and lazy, not to mention being difficult to read.

, In your comments, don’t be biased or rude. Although you want to be able to express yourself, jumping into a conversation with your guns blazing makes people want to get away from you, especially if they disagree. Instead, maintain a polite and kind demeanor—even when you do disagree—to avoid polarizing the conversation and losing friends before you even start.

Save your passionate opinions for a one-on-one chat with someone who agrees, or for forums specifically designated as a space for debate.
Don’t personally attack anyone. Online spaces are just as particular about this as real-life places. This fact is easy to forget on online, where you aren’t seeing people’s body language.

, To get to know people, you want to show interest in their lives just like in real life. Show interest by asking pertinent questions that aren’t awkward or embarrassing to answer. You may find that they ask you questions in return.

Just like in real life, listening is a key for making online friendships.Be open about your life when you are asked questions, because just like in real life, being shy will push most people away. You can’t build a friendship if there isn’t both give and take.

, Once you have established a solid rapport with someone and feel that they are a safe friendship, you may want to exchange email addresses. This is especially useful if you are going to be out of touch (except through email) on a trip., Just like in real life, you have to communicate with people in order to stay friends with them. This means replying to messages, to posts, and asking questions and making inquiries about people before they ask you. This is called pursuing friendships.Reply to messages promptly. If you wait days or week to respond, you risk losing an online friendship, as it makes you look disinterested or too busy.

, Not only should you PM (private message) other users on a regular basis, but commenting in forums and threads keeps you current with friends. It also keeps your name in front of them so that you don’t get forgotten.

Tag others in your comments to include them, share ideas, and encourage conversation.

, If your friendship is going well and you have made sure that someone is safe, you may want to consider talking on the phone. Although this mode of communication is already in place for most online gaming, not so for most websites. Phone chats are fun because they make communication instant, deepening your friendship.

Think about meeting in real life, but only if you have already talked on the phone or through video chat to verify their identity. Take your time getting to the point of meeting in real life.Both phone chats and real-life meetings are normal parts of online dating sites.

, Conflict with online friends is inevitable, just like it is in real life. And just like real life, you want to deal with it so that your reputation doesn’t become tarnished with other users. Ask to PM or video/phone chat a friend in order to deal with the conflict, rather than trying to work it out in a public forum or slowly over email.

It is recommended that you take some time to cool off before trying to work through a conflict with an online friend, as well as discuss the situation with someone else to gain perspective., You can often sense when an online interaction is unsafe by paying attention to the way a person phrases things. If they keep pressuring you to give personal information, payment information, or your specific location, this is a red flag. You can also sense if someone is lying about their identity by the way to they talk about their profession or school environment, especially if you are very familiar with it.

For example, if someone says they are 16 but consistently uses the vocabulary of a college student; or if someone says they are from the UK but consistently uses American turns of phrase.
Leave a chat if you feel uncomfortable. There is no rule that says you can’t simply close out of a chat or delete an email without any explanation. Doing so is wise if you ever feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.

, Even though plenty of people lie about their age in order to access particular websites or deceive people for personal gain, plenty of others are honest about their age. Do your best to strike up friendships with people from your age group so that you aren’t encouraged to do something that is dangerous for your age.

For example, if you are 16 and you chat with someone who says they are 25, the 25-year-old might want to talk about things that are illegal for your age, like smoking and drinking. Talking about things like this can make you want to do them in order to impress your friend, but this is unwise since it can get you put in juvenile incarceration.

, You may want to share your school, state, province, county, or city in an online community in order to find friends who also live there or have visited, but don’t share your address. This is a good rule of thumb that can prevent you from accidentally telling a predator where you are located.

Ask external websites to take down your address, like WhitePages.com, so that others can’t search for your name on the internet and find out where you are.
Set all your profiles to private so that you aren’t sharing your contact details with everyone.

, Try not to use your actual name—at least not your last name or surname—so that others can’t find your details in an internet search. Instead, try to make a username out of an activity or show that you enjoy, like soccergirl or Sherlock_fan.

Likewise for your profile picture, use a non-descript profile image or avatar. Don’t use an actual picture of yourself, but instead upload an image of nature or your favorite movie character. You can also create an avatar on the internet to place in profile picture slots., If someone asks you for money through an online community, this is a red flag that you are dealing with a spammer or identity thief. Always refuse to pay for anything, especially if they ask for a card number or bank account number.

Do not share any type of payment information. PayPal may be ok, but make sure there is a real website that you are submitting to, if they are asking on behalf of a company or organization.
Avoid lending money in general to someone you have met online, as this can lead to a security breach.
You also don’t want to reveal that you can be pressured into giving money, because if you will give a little, you might give a lot, placing you in a situation where you might be repeatedly pressured for money.

, Absolutely never give out personal details like your social security number, birthdate, and passport number, as these are what people can use to steal your identity. Studies show that most teenagers are pretty good about protecting their personal info and keeping their profiles set to private, and everyone should follow their example.Avoid describing your appearance online as well.

, If you do decide to set up a phone or video chat, be very sure that the person you have agreed to talk to is a real person and not a spammer or predator. You can look for signs of online predators like these:Has a lot of activity with children on their accounts
Asks questions about who you are wanting to talk to
Appears to be a respected member of society
Excessively flatters, compliments, and affirms
Tries to turn you against people you trust like your parents or spouse
Makes threats

, If you have vetted an online friend thoroughly, including having had both phone and video chats to confirm they are not a predator, you may want to meet them in real life. If you do decide to meet, make sure to do so in a busy public place (like a mall or subway station) and take someone with you who can protect you, like a parent or older sibling, even an older friend.

It is helpful if the person with you knows personal defense skills or has a reputation for identifying compromising situations or dangerous people.

, There are many general interest websites that are tailored to different demographics, such as academics, comics, instant messengers, virtual realities, art, and so on. Most of these sites have forums that you can comment on. There are also websites that are strictly discussion boards. Some examples of these sites include:

DeviantArt
Penny Arcade
LambdaMOO
Wikihow
Wikipedia
Second Life
Friendsies
FriendMatch

, You can also find friends when you take online classes. Most online classes require participation on discussion boards, which allows you to get to know other like-minded students. The online forums for these classes also allow you to access student emails so that you can communicate outside of class.

Most colleges and universities now have online counterparts to their on-campus courses, so search your campus website.

, By now, social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram are household names. Most of the “friends” people have on these sites are people they know in real life, but that doesn’t mean strangers can’t add each other as “friends.” In fact, teenagers say they find a lot of friends this way.Use sites for dating, like match.com and eharmony. Although these sites are meant for helping people find romance, it is possible to make friends with the men and women who you don’t end up dating.
Use sites for platonic friendships, like Patook and Bumble BFF. Those are structured like dating apps but only have members who are looking for friends.
Use sites made for kids to teach them how to make healthy friendships online. Sites like Stardoll and Gaia Online allow kids to create friendships over safe things like comic books and tv shows.

, Start a blog and promote it through social media. Once you start to generate readers and followers, you can comment on other blogs, which will warrant comments on your posts by other bloggers. This is a fun way to connect with like-minded writers and discuss issues that are relevant to your daily life, as well as provide you a space for venting your thoughts.

Blogging is also becoming a way for many people to make good money.
Sites like Blogger.com, Wordpress.com, and LiveJournal are reliable blogging spaces.

, Most large cities have MeetUp.com sites so that community members can easily find others who share their interests. Meetup sites tends to focus on meeting in real life, but since these are group-oriented activities, users who are accompanied by friends are generally safe., As seen in steps above, joining online gaming communities is an easy way to make friends. To play most games, however, you have to purchase the disc and pay for an online subscription, as well as have the home equipment to use it. Some free games do exist, but they are usually not as fun or interactive because gamers don’t like them.You usually need either a fast, high-capacity PC or a gaming system like PlayStation or Xbox, with a good quality controller and headset, to truly enjoy the gaming scene and make friends.

, Why not make friends while earning money? Many freelancing websites allow you to set up chats with clients and fellow freelancers so that you can more quickly communicate about the work. These chats can easily turn toward personal things, developing friendships while you do your work.

Such sites include UpWork.com, WriterAccess.com, and Freelance.com.

Highlight what songs you want to convert.,
Convert your old songs.",How to Convert Songs in iTunes," There are several types of song format available on iTunes and a variety of reasons to convert your songs from one to the other. When choosing a song format, you want to consider the file's size and quality. Do you want to hear the song in pristine condition? Or do you want to fit as many songs as possible on your computer or iPhone? Do you want a mix of both?



AAC: A modern version of the mp3, it offers the small size of an mp3 but with higher audio quality. This is the most common format for an iPhone or iPod and is generally found on Mac machines and products. Not all music players can play AAC files, but this is the easiest ""all-around"" option for Mac users

AIFF: A big file that, along with WAV, offers the highest quality song. It does not copy information like Song Title, Artist, etc, however. While you can still see this in iTunes, you will get only ""Track 1, Track 2, etc."" in any other music player. It is generally more common for Mac users than WAV.

Apple Lossless: A high quality song file that is slightly smaller than AIFF or WAV files but can only be played on Apple programs and devices.

mp3: A small, low quality song file that can be played on any mp3 player, including mp3 CD players or other most other music devices and programs (Windows Media Player, Zune, etc.)

WAV:A big but high quality file similar to AIFF. WAV files are generally more common with Windows systems, but Macs can read them as well. It does not copy information like Song Title, Artist, etc, though iTunes remembers this for you.;
, In iTunes, click on ""Edit"" → ""Preferences"" (Windows) or ""iTunes"" → ""Preferences"" (Mac). Click on the ""General"" Tab at the top of the Preferences window when it opens.


In newer versions of iTunes ""Preferences"" can be found by clicking on the small black and white square in the upper left corner of iTunes., This is where you get to decide how iTunes formats all new songs that you add to iTunes. This allows you to convert your current songs to whatever format you choose as well. Choose what format you prefer under ""Import Using."" You can adjust the settings if you want specific file sizes or audio quality:


Adjust your song quality using the ""Setting"" dropdown menu. The higher the ""kpbs,"" ""bit-rate,"" and ""kHz"" the better the song's quality but the bigger the file size.iTunes has many preset settings ranging from iTunes Plus (high quality, mid-sized files) to ""Good Quality"" mp3's (low quality, small files). If you are in doubt, choose automatic or iTunes Plus.

, Be sure to click ""OK"" and not ""Cancel,"" which will eliminate your changes. Now, any new song you import to iTunes will be converted for you, but you'll have to take another step to convert your old songs.

, You can select as many songs as you want and convert them at once. Highlight the first song you want to convert by clicking on it, then scroll down to the last song you want to convert. Holding the ""Shift"" key, click on the last song to highlight all of the songs in between it and your first track.To select only certain songs, click on each song while holding the CTRL key (Windows) or Command key (Mac).

, Right click on a song and choose the option ""Create ____ Version"" This blank will be filled in by whatever you chose in your Import Settings-- if you chose AAC files, then it will say ""Create AAC Version"" for example. It will take a few minutes until the files are done converting.


You will make two versions of songs when you convert. You can check which is which by right clicking the song and selecting ""Get Info.""
Every time you change your import settings you can create a new version in iTunes."

For example, you could decide that you want to set a goal of smiling at one new person every week, or of striking up a conversation with someone in the elevator. Or, you might decide that you want to set a goal to invite friendly coworker to go for a walk with you during your lunch hour.
Talk to your therapist about your goals for making new friends and work on some ways that you can do that.;
, When you have a psychotic disorder, you may not be willing to put yourself out there as much. However, it is often necessary to be the one to introduce yourself or invite someone to do something to get a friendship started.


Invite someone to coffee, send out an e-mail or text message, or invite a new possible friend to see a movie.Try saying something like, “Hey Samantha. I hope you are having a good day! I was thinking about going to see a movie this weekend. Would you like to go with me?”
Try taking small steps at first. For example, you could start initiating contact by texting a friend and just asking how his or her day is going, such as, “Hey Joe. How are you doing today?”
You can also try practicing initiating contact with someone, by talking to yourself in the mirror. For example, you can try practicing how you will say hello or how you will ask someone to join you for coffee.

, Once you start making new friends, make sure you don't get too attached too quickly. Try not to be clingy or overbearing when you are still solidifying your friendship. For example, don’t call 10 times per day or text your friend constantly or show up at his or her house unless you have been invited. It is important for people to have time to themselves, so try your best to respect that.Also try not to call, text, or visit your new friend if your friend has indicated that he or she is busy.
When you spend time away from your new friends, focus on your own hobbies and enjoying your alone time, or spend some time with your family.
If you find it hard to keep a friendship or you develop unwanted symptoms surrounding your new friendships, such as obsessing over a new friend or having delusions about a new friend, then work with your therapist or psychologist to get past this.

, If a friend has to cancel or change plans on you, don't take it as a personal affront or jump to conclusions about the reason. Things come up and plans change, but it likely has nothing to do with you or your friendship.Don't take any change of plans or anything your friend does as a reflection on you.


Your psychotic disorder can make you misinterpret things or see things that aren't there, so make sure you keep this in mind with new friends.
If you have a hard time making friends, you may take anything like that to heart. Make sure you work with therapist or psychologist to work through any abandonment or attachment issues you have.

, Just because you make a new friend doesn't mean you have to keep that friend. Try not to force a friendship to happen if it isn't natural. Instead, aim to make lasting, meaningful relationships rather than trying to connect to people you do not want to be around.Make sure it isn't your psychotic disorder keeping you from making these connections.
Having friends you actually want to connect with will help you through treatment and make you feel better.

, When you are trying to making new friends, it is important to connect with those around you. Keeping your face glued to a phone or tablet will not help you connect to others or make friends. Keep your phone in your pocket or purse when you are around people so you can pay attention to them and make meaningful connections.

If you put down your phone, you will be more approachable and be more likely to make connections.

Understand your body’s pH.,
Know the importance of alkaline foods.,
Recognize the benefits of the diet.",How to Alkalize Your Diet3," pH refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the body. The pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, usually between 7.37 and 7.43.Because of the processed foods you eat, your bodies can get too acidic.


The body closely controls the pH of the blood. If the pH of the blood changes, serious consequences can result, such as heart arrhythmias, lung conditions, blood sugar control problems, coma, seizures, stupor, and death.Food can affect the pH of your urine and the contents of your breath, but not the pH of your blood. Some who promote the alkaline diet often claim that this diet protects your bones from acid, but acid in your diet does not affect bones., It is a fact that overall alkaline foods are better for your health than acidic foods. Although reason and science doesn’t support an alkaline diet, eating alkaline foods is good for you., Though foods may not significantly change the pH of your blood and there’s no evidence for any significant medical changes, the alkaline diet can help you become healthier and promote weight loss.Since the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables and low in animal protein, some early evidence has shown eating alkaline foods can help prevent kidney stones, strengthen muscles and bones, boost heart and brain function, reduce lower back pain, and lower risk for type 2 diabetes."

Use the right equation.,
Find the object's weight.,
Find the sine of the angle.,
Multiply the sine by the outside force.,
Subtract this value from the weight.,
Write your answer.",How to Find Normal Force4," To calculate the normal force of an object at rest when an outside force acts upward on that object, use the equation: N = m * g - F * sin(x)'



N refers to the normal force, m refers to the object's mass, g refers to the acceleration of gravity, F refers to the outside force, and x refers to the angle between the object and the direction of the outside force.

Example: Find the normal force of a block with a mass of 4.2 kg, when a person is pulling up at the block at a 50 degree angle with a force of 20.9 N.

, The weight of an object equals the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of gravity.


Note that the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface is a constant: g = 9.8 m/s2


Example: weight = m * g = 4.2 * 9.8 = 41.16

, The sine of an angle is calculated by dividing the side of the triangle opposite the angle by the hypotenuse of the angle.



Example: sin(50) = 0.77

, The outside force refers to the force acting upward on the object, in this instance.



Example: 0.77 * 20.9 = 16.01

, Doing so will give you the normal force at work.



Example: 41.16 – 16.01 = 25.15

, Note that for an object at rest being influenced by an external, upward force, the normal force will be less then the weight of the object.



Example: The normal force is 25.15 N.

Identify your skills to figure out where to start.,
Evaluate your experience to find relevant areas to pursue.,
Take your education into account.,
Define the job you are looking for.,
Figure out the kind of position you are seeking.,
Decide the type of company you want to work for.,
Determine the industry or industries you want to investigate.,
Prepare a targeted cover letter and resume.,
Update social media profiles to coincide with your resume.",How to Start a Job Search1," In order to find the right job, you need to understand where your strengths lie. You can do this by taking a look at your skills and determining what you are best suited for.


Figure out what types of skills you have.
This includes both hard skills (teachable skills) such as project management and soft skills (skills that are usually not taught but are part of a person’s natural abilities or personal traits) such as problem solving skills.
You can determine these skills by looking back at your accomplishments and failures.
The areas in which you have excelled will be your skills.;
, Figure out which parts of your past experience you enjoyed and excelled in the most. Determining this will help you determine which career path is right for you if you are currently undecided.


For example, you were a customer service representative in a call center.
You loved talking to the customers and were able to quickly solve their problems, but you did not like being on the phone all day.
Since you enjoyed helping customers and you excelled at problem solving, perhaps retail customer service is better for you.

, If you have a degree or certification in a particular field, determine if it will be helpful during your job search.


For example, you have a marketing degree and you are interested in a marketing position.

, Based on the evaluation of your skills and experience, define the type of job you want to apply to. This does not only include just job title, but also the type of company and industry you feel you will work best in or have the most experience in.


Before you start applying to jobs, it is best to determine a few key facets of the jobs you will pursue.

, While it is good to try to apply for jobs that interest you, you may find you will get more responses back from jobs that you appear most qualified for.


This is why taking a look at your qualifications is so important.
You will find searching for a job a bit easier if you can define the job titles and levels within the organization you want to apply to.
You can narrow your search down even further by defining acceptable work schedules (days, nights, etc.) and employment status (full time, part time, contract or temp).
For example, based on your self-evaluation you want to apply to a full time customer service manager position in New York City with no specified shifts.

, If you can define the type of company you want work for and the type of environment you would fit well in, you will be able to focus your time by applying to open positions only at these companies, instead of places where you would never be happy.


Factors to look at when evaluating the type of company you want to work for include: private vs. public, size (small, mid or large), global vs. non-global and company culture and fit.

, You may be more qualified or interested in one particular industry than another. Think about the type of experience you have and the role you are looking for.


Then, determine which industry or industries you would like to work in.
Take the location into consideration when targeting an industry.
Before wasting your time applying for jobs you will not accept, you must pinpoint the location or locations you would work and/or travel to.
Think about working remotely or telecommuting as well.

, It is not recommended to submit a general cover letter and resume for each position you want to apply to.


Every job has certain qualifications and experience they are looking for, that may not be necessarily needed for another job (even if it is the same title but at a different company).
Therefore, you must update your cover letter and resume to include the most relevant information for each particular job.
In order to adjust your cover letter and resume properly, you should read each job description carefully and highlight the qualifications needed.

, Updating your social media profiles is slightly different than updating your resume. Although your profiles should remain very similar to the resumes you submit to companies, they must include all of your experience as pertaining to the types of jobs you are looking for.


This means instead of being specific to each job description, you should include qualifications that are required for the majority of jobs you are applying to.
For example, you are applying to several customer service representative positions that all stress problem solving experience, but one position is for a technology company while the others are for major department stores.
While it is not necessary to add your tech experience to your resume for the department store applications, it is definitely important for the technology company.
Therefore, it is important to note your tech experience in your social media profiles to provide a full picture of your experience.

Cut your lemon into slices or wedges.,
Lay your lemon slices on a cookie sheet and place in freezer.,
Transfer the lemons to a zip lock bag.",How to Freeze Lemons2," Cutting your lemon into pieces before you freeze them will circumvent the soft consistency of the lemon so that you can use it in things like cocktails and garnishes. Cut the lemon on a cutting board width-wise about a 1/4 of an inch (6.35 millimeters) to create lemon slices. To cut the lemon in wedges, make one cut lengthwise and one cut width wise. This will create four same-sized lemon wedges.You can also cut lemon slices in half to create crescent-shaped lemon slices.

, Ensure that the lemon slices have free space in between them. Putting your lemon slices on a cookie sheet will allow them to freeze individually. If you skip this step, your lemon slices or wedges will freeze together in one block. Keep the slices of lemon the freezer for 2-3 hours, or until the lemons are frozen completely.


You will know when your lemons are frozen when they are hard, and the pulp no longer creates juice when you press down on it.

, After your lemons are completely frozen, you can transfer them to a ziplock bag to free up space in your freezer. Place the zip lock bag back into the freezer and take out slices as you need them.

Prepare your spouse.,

Decide on ground rules.,
Don't let it drag on.,
Consider a therapist.,
Get a lawyer.,
Continue to talk.,
Keep it to yourself.,
Sort out your feelings.,
Be able to lay it out in concrete terms.,
Decide what you want from the separation.,
Have a time frame in mind.",How to Ask for a Trial Separation," You don't want to blindside the person out of nowhere. Alerting your spouse that you want to have a discussion can help him or her mentally prepare for what's ahead, even if they're not aware of exactly what you're going to say.You could say, ""I'd like to discuss where our relationship is headed. Can we sit down and talk about it soon?""
That helps clue your partner into the fact that something's up.
Also, pick a good time to sit down in person. This conversation isn't one you want to have over email or the phone. This conversation needs to happen in person, when your spouse has the time and emotional space to deal with it. You don't want to be distracted by other things. It might be a good idea to have someone babysit for you if you have kids. While you don't want to put it off, timing is everything. For instance, if your spouse's parent died last week, you may want to wait a little while.;
, You may want to circle around the topic, but it's best to just get it over with, though you can be gentle about it. In addition, you need to take responsibility for why you want this separation. That is, you need to tell your partner why you feel the need to separate.Lead with what you want the discussion to be about. You could say, ""I don't think we've been in the same place lately, and I feel us growing apart. I'd like to discuss the possibility of a trial separation.""
Don't be afraid to talk about what you're feeling. ""I am afraid that if we go on like this we will fight and argue our way to divorce, and I hope that spending some time apart will help us see what our options are without ruining each other in the process.""

, Now that you've broached the topic, you need to let your spouse know what you expect to happen from the separation. Though it can hurt, being in the same page is important because it helps to guide your expectations through the separation.For instance, if you think the separation is a stepping stone to a divorce, you could say, ""Right now, I'm really just trying to figure out what I want. However, if things don't change between us, I could see this leading to a more permanent separation.""
On the other hand, if you want the separation as a time to think with the hopes of reconciliation, you might say, ""I know asking for a separation is hurtful to you. However, I don't think things have been right between us for a while, and I think we need some time apart to figure out how to move forward in our relationship. I really do want to work it out, though, and hopefully get back together after our time apart.""

, This conversation may come as a hard blow, even if your spouse realizes you've been having problems as a couple. Let your spouse have a chance to react, as his or her first reaction is probably going to be emotional. Give your spouse a chance to talk through it before you start trying to evaluate whether it's a good option for your both.Once your spouse has gotten over the initial shock, start asking questions to determine what your spouse is feeling and thinking, such as, ""So what do you think? Do you think it's a good idea?""
It may be that your spouse is on the same page, thinking time apart would do you good, but your partner may not want that all.

, That is, you both have things you'll need from each other to make your marriage work. If you've done you're homework, you already have some ideas of what you need from your partner, but your partner will also have some for you.Remember, these goals need to be concrete and specific. For instance, ""Be less distant"" is not concrete enough. ""Check in with me at least 2 times a day"" is more specific.
Be open to hearing what your partner needs, as well. Each of you should have 3 to 4 goals for the other person.
Agree that both of you will work on the goals without resorting to looking over the other person's shoulder. That is, you can't blame not achieving your goals on the other person not achieving theirs.

, Once you've had the conversation about the separation, you need to have another about the rules of the separation. You need to decide whether you're going to live apart, how the bills are going to get paid, and who's going to do what with the kids.You should also discuss whether dating is allowed and how far you can go on a date. For instance, if you expect to get back together, you may decide to rule out dating or sex.
These rules will need to be very specific. For instance, if you're talking about who gets to spend what time with the kids, you need to lay out what days and nights of the week the kids will spend with each party.
Remember that the ground rules you set for a separation may affect what happens if you get a divorce, such as custody arrangements. For instance, if your kids are mostly living with one parent or the other, that parent may be granted primary custody. Talk to a lawyer to make sure that your ground rules are fair to both of you and your kids.
You may need some help laying out these ground rules. If you expect to get back together, you're going to both need to compromise on the rules. Also, put your rules in writing. Doing so can make sure everyone is on the same page., Together, set a time limit for your separation. It could be 3 months, half a year, or a full year. After you've set a limit on how long your separation will be, you can decide to let it go for longer. However, you don't want to keep dragging it out. If you keep asking for more time over and over, it may be that it's just time to end the marriage. If neither of you are willing to fight for the relationship anymore, it may not be worth it., If you're having enough trouble to want a separation, a third party mediator, such as a therapist can help. A therapist will help you to discuss your problems without getting so heated and hopefully work on finding common ground. A therapist will expect both of you to be emotionally present, working hard to put your relationship first.Ask around for recommendations for a couple's therapist from friends you trust. More than likely, some of your friends have had problems, too, and may have seen someone who's good for you and your spouse, too.
A therapist can be objective about your relationship, whereas it's harder for the two of you to be objective about something that you are both so emotionally invested in. Therefore, suggest to your partner that you consider going to a therapist.
Another option for a mediator is a pastor.
You could say, ""Given all I've said about a separation, I think it's important that we talk to a mediator. I was thinking we could talk to a couple's therapist once a week to see if they can help us sort out some of our problems. I really want to make this work, but I do think we could use some outside help.""

, A lawyer is also important when you're separating. Once again, it's good to ask your friends who've been through a divorce if they have any recommendations for lawyers. A lawyer will go over the legal ramifications of your separation so you know what to expect if you do get a divorce. In addition, your lawyer can act as a mediator for you if you need one.You can also look up reviews of lawyers online to find one that most people have been happy with. Meet with the lawyer before deciding to engage him or her as your personal lawyer. Ask the lawyer if they're willing to act as a mediator if you need it and how often they've worked with people on a trial separation. Plus, you want to make sure you connect with your lawyer and trust him or her as a person.
As noted in the step about laying out ground rules, it's important to remember that what you do in your separation can affect your divorce. What you decide about who takes care of the kids now, for instance, can be used to decide who gets custody of your kids.

, If you have a trial separation without spending any time talking, you won't be able to work through your problems. If you really want to get back together, you're going to need to spend time talking through your problems, preferably with a third party.For instance, you could try talking on the phone twice a week. Consider addressing specific issues each time you talk. Talking on the phone cuts out some of the emotional charge in the situation. If you're really emotional, you may want to start with emails and the move up to phone calls.
If you've engaged a therapist or you're visiting with a pastor, that can be one way you can continue to connect with each other.

, Of course, telling your close friends and family that you've separated is appropriate. However, now isn't the time to post a huge announcement on social media. You are trying to decide if things will work out, and having the whole world (or at least all your friends, including the person you never liked from high school) weigh in isn't going to help. What happens going forward should be between you and your spouse, and possibly a good therapist., You're obviously feeling like something is wrong with the relationship. However, you need to be able to put your finger on why, not just put it in general terms. That needs you need to spend some time thinking about what you think has gone wrong with the relationship.Some areas you can think about are whether you still have fun together and laugh and whether you still have similar goals. Sex is also an area that can cause problems.
Another area you can look at is the way you communicate. Has communication broken down in your marriage? Can you identify where it started breaking it down?
Also, consider the ways you care for each other. Happy couples enjoy doing things for each other. If you find you are doing all the work in the relationship, both the emotional work and the physical work of living together, that could a large part of the problem--your spouse isn't holding up her or his end of the marriage.

, That is, you have figured out why you're unhappy. To be fair to your spouse, you need to be able to lay out in exact terms what's not working for you. The best way to do that, once you figure out what's wrong, is to give concrete goals and ask for the same in return.For instance, maybe you're unhappy because you don't feel like your spouse pays attention to you anymore.
A concrete goal would be to spend alone time together at least twice a week.
Come up with 3 to 4 concrete goals that you can discuss with your spouse., That is, are you almost certain you will get a divorce after the separation? That's something you need to be up front about. However, if you really want a separation to help you decide if you still want to be in the relationship, it's okay to bring that to the table, too., In many cases, couples who have a trial separation set a certain time frame. When that time frame is up, the couple either decides to get back together or to divorce. One therapist recommends 3 months as a good time frame, but you should have a time frame in mind when you talk to your spouse, along with a good justification for that amount of time.For instance, you might feel like half a year is better to figure out your feelings.
Alternatively, you may want to separate for 3 months to give your spouse a chance to go through rehab. If they don't, you may choose to divorce at the end of that period.
Of course, you can reevaluate after the time period. If you're both still unsure, you can agree to another length of time.

Clean your affected eye(s) often.,
Apply a cold compress to soothe discomfort caused by pink eye.,
Use over the counter artificial drops.",How to Deal With Pink Eye3," Pink eye is often accompanied by drainage, which can build up and cause your eyes to crust over. It is important to keep your affected eye(s) as clean as possible. Use a wet washcloth to wipe away any drainage from your eye(s). You can also use tissues or paper towels.


Use a fresh tissue or clean part of the washcloth each time you wipe your eye.
Make sure that you wipe from your inner eye (near your nose) towards your outer eye.
Dispose of tissues right after you use them and put washcloths into the dirty laundry right away.

, You can soothe some of the discomfort associated with an infection by applying cool sterilized compresses to your closed eyes.Avoid using warm compresses because they can increase the spread of infection. Also, make sure that you use a separate compress for each eye and that you use a clean towel every time you use a compress.To make a compress:


Put some ice in a clean, plastic bag and seal.
Wrap the bag with tinfoil. This is needed to prevent the ice melting quickly from your body heat.
Wrap once more with a paper towel or a towel to secure contents. This also allows compress to be less messy and more comfortable.
Gently put your compress on one eye. Leave it there for 5 minutes.
Repeat process with the other eye for 5 minutes.

, Artificial drops can help ease your symptoms by reducing the gritty sensation that sometimes accompanies pink eye. If you are already using prescription eye drops, make sure to ask your doctor about using lubricating drops in addition to prescription eye drops.Your best bet for eye drops that will not interact negatively with prescribed medications is plain sterile saline solution. Your pharmacist can help you find it.

, Everyone needs time alone, to be able to recharge their batteries away from other people.

You don't need to do everything as a couple, and liking different things is not a sign of relationship trouble., Be sure to make time for your other friends as well, especially without your boyfriend.

These can involve times where you will have time apart from one another. Setting a schedule can be a good way to make sure both of you get the space you need, and quality time together., Time apart is important in a relationship, and you shouldn't feel bad about taking it. If you worry while you are gone, you won't be able to get the kind of recharging you need., This lets him know that you do want to include him in your life, and should make him more willing to accept it later. Also, it is a good sign if he is interested in the details and learning more about you."

Consult with your doctor or midwife first.,

Move around during labor.,
Take a warm bath.,
Eat and drink during labor.,
Avoid ""old wives' remedies.""",How to Help Labor Progress2," Even though activities such as having sex or trying an herbal supplement may seem harmless, in some cases they could cause harm to you or your baby. Before trying any natural option to help labor progress, ask your doctor or midwife. She will help you decide whether there are safe, effective options for you.


If you ever have questions, or even just feel frustrated about your pregnancy seeming to take so long, talk to your doctor or midwife. These professionals are used to the concerns and questions pregnant women have and are happy to talk with you about them.

, Walking is one of the most popular activities to help labor progress and to start labor. Gravity is the main reason walking works. The baby is drawn down towards your pelvis and this primes your cervix for labor. The swaying rhythm of walking pushes your baby's head against your cervix, simulating the release of oxytocin. This hormone can trigger contractions.Walking can also help build muscle and increase physical fitness, making labor faster and less painful.Slow, gentle walking is ideal. Do not go too far or push yourself too hard physically in the late stages of labor. An easy stroll around the block is probably adequate., Sex can be difficult in the late, late stages of pregnancy, particularly if labor has already begun. However, certain hormones released during sexual activity may speed up labor, although little evidence to support this exists.Because certain pregnancy complications can make nipple stimulation or sex unsafe for your baby, you should always discuss this option with your doctor or midwife before trying it.


Penetration can stimulate your body to release prostaglandins, a hormone that helps dilate the cervix, prepping your body for delivery. Stimulation of the breasts and nipples or orgasm can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which may trigger contractions.Remember, sex is only safe if your water has not broken yet. Once your water breaks, sex could lead to an infection that could complicate labor and delivery., Oftentimes, if your labor has been latent for a long time, walking, moving, or even switching the position you're lying in can help get things moving again.


Moving is a great way to help you cope with the pain of labor. Walking, shifting in bed, and standing up keep your body rested and refreshed and help save energy for the final pushes.Movement also wiggles the baby around, helping it move towards your pelvis and ultimately push through your birth canal., If you're giving birth at home or haven't left for the hospital yet, a warm bath may help you feel more comfortable. However, there is no evidence that a warm bath will help labor progress.Make sure the water completely covers your stomach and breasts as this will provide the most pain relief.Contractions are less painful for many women in water and often the soothing sensation of being in a tub helps women relax and rest in between contractions.Water also makes it makes it easier for you to move around and change positions. As stated, movement during labor helps it progress., The muscles surrounding your uterus need a lot of hydration and nutrition to successfully deliver an infant. Eating well in the weeks leading up to labor, and in its early stages, can help labor progress quickly.


Many doctors do not recommend eating during labor due to the risks associated with food being in the digestive track if emergency anesthesia is needed. Ask your doctor about their policies beforehand and, if eating is not allowed, have a light snack before leaving for the hospital.You may also find that a clear liquid diet, involving a warm broth or jello, is helpful. Most hospitals will allow laboring patients to consume clear liquids.
Labor is shorter when you snack during the process. Women allowed to eat during labor had labor times of 45 to 90 minutes less of those who did not. Laboring is difficult and requires fuel in the form of foods and liquids especially during the final pushes.Stick to bland but filling foods, like toasts with jam, plain pasta, applesauce, and jell-o. As for liquids, go for clear broth, water, and ice chips. These foods are easy to digest and tend not to increase nausea or stomach discomfort., Several ""natural"" ways to induce labor circulate on the internet, but none of them have significant research backing, and some can be actively harmful. It is best to avoid these and consult with your doctor or midwife about proven, safe, and effective ways to speed up labor.Castor oil. Castor oil is one of the oldest recommendations when it comes to starting labor naturally, but there is no evidence that it works, and it can make you very sick. The American Association of Family Physicians does not recommend that you use castor oil to induce labor.Herbal supplements. These commonly include evening primrose oil, black or blue cohosh, red raspberry leaves, and black haw. They do not have much evidence to support their use, and herbal remedies may interfere with other medical conditions or medications you're taking.Acupuncture. Acupuncture is not supported as an effective way to induce or progress labor."

Use an eyeliner pencil.,
Try liquid eyeliner.,
Buy a cosmetic brush or some cotton swabs.,
Pull your lower lid taut.,
Run the eyeliner pencil along the edge of the lower lid.,
Do the same for the upper lid.,
Touch up the outer corner of the eye.,
Smooth the lines.,
Smudge the eyeliner.,
Draw on a ""winged"" edge.,
Line just one lid.,
Go with a different shade.",How to Apply Eyeliner (Men)," The most common method for applying guyliner is by using an eyeliner pencil. These pencils have soft, malleable points that draw on smoothly and have a rich, dark, creamy color. Eyeliner pencils are easy to come by and can be purchased in most drug stores or supermarkets in the personal hygiene section. They come in multiple colors and shades, but black is standard and is the most masculine.Using a pencil will allow you to draw on more precise lines and contours, but because of their sharp tips and closeness to the eye they require a bit more practice.
Run the tip of a new eyeliner pencil over the soft part of your palm a few times before you begin applying it to your eyelid. This will blunt the tip somewhat so that it doesn’t poke or scratch.;
, If it’s your first time putting on guyliner and you’re uncomfortable with having a pointy pencil tip near your eye, you might try a liquid eyeliner applicator. Rather than a soft pencil-lead type point, liquid eyeliners go on wet using a thin brush tip that lets you trace precise lines, then dries around the eye. A liquid eyeliner can make a good alternative for the inexperienced user, or for those looking to draw on darker, thicker lines.It can be tough to draw on thin, straight lines using a liquid eyeliner, but one advantage of a liquid and brush combination is that it lends itself to creating a much more fluid coat around the eye.

, A chisel brush or any similar thin, soft cosmetic brush can be used to soften the edges of the eyeliner after it’s been applied. A simple cotton swab will also do, although the fluffy texture of the cotton might smear the eyeliner too much and make a mess. While not a necessity, a makeup brush or cotton swab can soften lines for a more natural contour around the eye for those who don’t want that hard-edged look.Small sweeps of a makeup brush will blend the hard edges of the eyeliner.
Dampen the cotton swab before you use it to blend.

, You’ll be lining the upper and lower lids separately. It’s usually easier to begin with the lower lid because your vision won’t be obstructed by your drawing hand. Use a finger at the outer edge of the eyelid to pull the lid taut; this will allow you to draw straighter lines without accidentally moving the eyelid. Pull the lid slightly downward so that you can start the line close to the inner eyelid to avoid creating gaps., Carefully place the point of the eyeliner pencil or brush just above the lower eyelash line and make short, linear strokes from the inner edge of the eye outward. Keep the lines as close to the inner eyelid as you can and try not to overlap. Go over the lines a few times from one side of the lid to the other until you achieve the desired style and thickness.Go slowly, even if you’re used to putting on guyliner. You’re working very close to the surface of the eye, so you don’t want to make a mistake.
Eyeliner can be applied either inside or outside the lash line depending on the look you're trying to achieve. Lining inside the lash line is more subtle and less distracting, while lining outside the lash line creates the appearance of thickness and is helpful in restructuring eye shape.

, Place a finger just below your eyebrow and pull the upper eyelid up and across. Once again, line the lid from the inner edge out, staying along the area just above the eyelashes. Go slowly and make sure you’ve got a good view of the eyelid and pencil in the mirror. Since the upper eyelid is thinner than the lower one, it’s easier to slip., Now that you’ve lined the upper and lower eyelids, use a few small strokes to fill in the space in the outer corner of the eye and connect the lines. This will give the eye a one-piece ringed look. Don’t fill in the inner corner of the eye—this is where the tear ducts are, and eyeliner that gets into these crevices can run and sting, causing a buildup of sticky black eye boogers and possibly even leading to infection.


Try not to “color in” the outer corner of the eye. This can end up looking more like a black eye than an expressive accent. Instead, line the upper and lower lids and go around the outer corner lightly, just enough to keep the lines from looking disjointed.

, Using the chisel brush or a damp cotton swab, go over the eyeliner with a sweeping motion to blend and soften the edges. You can also leave eyeliner as-is once you’ve drawn it on, but it will have a sharper, more jagged look, and any small mistakes you’ve made in the lines will be more noticeable. If you’ve drawn the eyeliner on thicker than you’d like or smeared it while smoothing, use a wet paper towel to wipe the area., Some proponents of guyliner, like Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance, prefer a deliberately smudged, messy look to their eyeliner. To accomplish this, apply the eyeliner thickly and then use a brush, cotton swab or the point of your finger to smudge it around and outward from your eye. Add more eyeliner as needed until you’re able to create the effect you’re after., Rather than simply penciling around the lash line, a winged liner can be used to add new dimensions to the shape of the eye. This technique will be useful in crafting a more theatrical look for themed dress, costume or the stage. Fold one corner of a small strip of tape over on itself and stick the tape on just under the lower eyelid. Then, line the eye as your normally would, but finish by drawing a short line from the outer edge of the eye to the tape and filling in the angular space it creates. You'll be left with an exotic flourish that provides an interesting alternative to regular contoured lining.Any type of tape will be sufficient for stenciling around the underside of the eye, but a softer tape with a weaker adhesive, such as masking or surgical tape, will probably work best as it won't cause irritation or discomfort once it's peeled off.
Be careful not to make the ""wing"" too large, or it may end up looking cartoonish.

, This is a less common approach, but one sometimes taken by Johnny Depp, Russell Brand and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Lightly line only the upper or lower eyelid, or apply it partially to just the outer edge of the eye. Partial lining can bring out your eyes and lend a dark, mysterious aesthetic without requiring you to encircle the whole eye.Because you’re going for a sleek, minimal eye effect, it will probably be easier to partially line using a pencil.

, While black is the popular choice for guyliner enthusiasts, it’s not your only option. Stick with a masculine color palette, but take a look at different gradients of black and more natural flesh tones. A charcoal eyeliner or one a few shades deeper than your own skin tone can highlight your eyes as well as a black one and not be quite as starkly obvious. Weigh your options and decide on a product that you like and that complements the look you’re trying to create.Try out a few different brands and styles of eyeliner until you find the right consistency and shade.

Add a letterhead at the top of the letter.,
Write the recipient’s name, address, and the date below the letterhead.,
Address the recipient.,
State your purpose in the first paragraph.,
Outline your qualifications in the middle paragraph(s).,
Include a positive statement or question in the final paragraph that will motivate the employer to contact you.,
Write an appropriate closing.,
Add your signature.,
Make a notation of the enclosures.",How to Write a Cover Letter3," Your letterhead should include your full name, address, telephone number, and email address. Some guidelines to follow when creating your letterhead:


Your name should be in bold 14- or 16-point font.
Your address and other contact information should be in normal 12-point font.
The font of your letterhead does not need to be Arial or Times New Roman, like the rest of your letter, but it should be professional looking and easy to read. The most important thing to remember is to include up-to-date information so that you make it easy for the employer to contact you.
You may want to include an extra line under the letterhead to create visual appeal and to separate the letterhead from the rest of the letter.

, It doesn't matter whether you put the date first or last, or how many blank lines you include between them, as long as it looks professional.


From here on out, use 12-point Arial or Times New Roman throughout the entire letter, set your margins to one inch, and use single spacing. Be sure your font is black, and if you're printing your letter out, use standard-sized paper (8 1/2” by 11”).

, Be sure to refer to the recipient by his or her proper title (Mrs., Mr., Dr., etc.). If you’re not sure who the recipient is, write, “To Whom It May Concern:” or “Dear Sir or Madam”; however, it is always best to address a cover letter to a real person to make it look like you’re not sending form letters.

, Tell the employer why you are writing to them in two or three sentences. State the position for which you are applying (or the one you would like to have should it become available).


You don't necessarily need to include how you became aware of the position unless it was through a mutual contact or recruiting program—in which case you should make the most of the connection.
If you are writing a letter of interest (also known as a prospecting or inquiry letter) in which you are asking about positions that might be available, specify why you are interested in working for the employer.

, Make sure to match them to the requirements of the position. If you are writing to inquire about open positions, tell the employer how you can contribute to their bottom line, not what you want to get out of the deal. To do this, use what you have researched about the employer's background and history.


Make your qualifications jump out at the reader by researching the company to which you are applying for a job and tailoring your letter accordingly. This will also be useful if you get an interview. Some questions to keep in mind as you write are

What is the employer's mission? What do they promote as the one thing that sets them apart from their competitors?
What kind of customer base does the employer have? Who is their target audience?
What is the company's history? Who founded it? How has the business evolved? What are the main highlights of the company's performance over the past few years?



, Make this closing paragraph between two to four sentences. Direct the employer to your enclosed resume and make sure you specify that you're available for an interview. Finish off by thanking the recruiter for their time and consideration, and welcome them to get in touch with you to continue the conversation.

, It’s a good idea to thank the reader for his or her time. After that, write “Sincerely,” “Respectfully,” or “Regards,” leave several spaces, and print your name.

, If you will be submitting your cover letter digitally, it’s a good idea to scan and add your signature, write it in with a digital writing pad, or make a digital signature stamp with appropriate software.

, If you enclose something, such as a resume, with a letter, you should indicate that the letter contains enclosures by making the notation “Enclosure” or “Enclosures” at the bottom of the letter.

Know the capacity of the mug.,
Put one tablespoon of sugar in the mug.








,

Add two teaspoons of water.,
Add about one inch of milk and stir to completely mix the cocoa paste and milk.,

, The next step is what paint chemists call ""wetting out the pigment."" Stir the sugar, water and cocoa until the cocoa is completely wetted out. You can tell this by the appearance of the surface. If it is reflective, you have wetted out the cocoa. If it is not, you need to stir more and possibly add a few more drops of water.








, Fill the rest of the mug with milk, up to about 1/2 an inch off the top. The mix will expand about 5% on heating, so don't over-fill.








,


For an 8 oz cup, heat (on highest setting) for one minute, 45 seconds.
For a 10 oz cup, heat 2 minutes, 10 seconds.
For the best results, use a double-boiler to steam the milk over the stove.

, For some reason, the cocoa tends to foam up. Usually this does not happen but, just in case, watch. If it does, open the door and stir. Take out the spoon, close the door and finish heating.

Sit down with a pen and paper and write down romantic, loving things you know she likes.,

Know your wife.,
A gift of some sort, even if it's tiny, adds to the romance.",How to Plan a Romantic Dinner at Home for Your Wife," Write down everything she likes that you think will make the night all the greater. Now of that list gather the things she's least familiar with, meaning things she hasn't seen or you haven't done for her in the longest time. Like if one of the list items was (take a bath together) and you haven't done that in over a year, whereas something else like (walk on the beach together at night) you did last month, well then choose the things you haven't done in a while. And for one of the things you choose that she likes, add a twist to it. Stimulate her mind. For instance, if she loves chocolate then maybe you could make her homemade chocolate rum balls (they only take ten minutes, and you could share them with her in the bath).;
, The more you plan the better, although it doesn't mean you have to do everything you plan or that you can't be flexible. But the more you have lined up to possibly do, the better. This way things won't get dull or boring and risk one of you falling asleep on the couch. Things will stay fun and stimulating.

, If she doesn't like all that much excitement, then perhaps falling asleep together on the couch might be something you could plan that she would enjoy (maybe surprise her with a new soft blanket to wrap around her). When you know the small details, this is what makes her feel special and lets her know that you pay attention to her (a cornerstone in a relationship).

, This gives the woman something to appreciate, something to admire which reflects your admiration of her. Your tangible affection in her hands.

Scope out cool consignment and thrift shops.,
The key is to think before you buy.,
Get some makeup.,
First, write down the make up you use most often.,
Go into the drugstore and buy ONLY the things on your list.",How to Be a Smart Shopper (Teen Girls)," Even if you've never shopped at a thrift store in your life, now may be the time to start. No, they don't sell old musty sweaters and things even your grandmother wouldn't wear. There are actually a few amazing ones--including some super trendy and cool vintage thrift shops downtown in cities. A good idea would be to Google ""thrift stores"" along with the name of the city closest to you, and you'll get tons of listings for great stores.


Even when thrift shopping, you'll still have to be, well, thrifty. Prices can add up quickly if it's a great store, so before you buy that sparkly pink dress for just $29.99, think about this:
It may look great hanging on the rack, but will you really like how it looks on you?
Will you ever really wear it? Try to think of at least three reasonable occasions when you'd wear it. School and church probably aren't one of them. Sure, it might be a great dress for that end-of-the-year dance, but if it's 8 months away, buy a dress then, not now. Chances are that dress won't look so amazing after 8 months of collecting dust in your closet.
Can you live without it? In other words, is it really worth that 30 dollars you COULD use to get a new pair of shoes or a shirt you'll get tons of use out of?;
, Never rush straight to the counter with the first things you saw in the store. Always try on clothes before you buy them, and never buy something just because it's a ""cool"" brand name.

, Girls love make up--after all, what's not to love? You can mix and match new brands and discover new products you'll love, and they make you look great. But the bad news is that make up can get expensive. Very expensive. Remember, you're not Emma Watson with a yearly income of $10 mil, so you can't afford to waltz through Nordstrom department store and buy whatever you want. Believe it or not, drug stores are a great place to get make up that's both a good quality AND a good price. As unglamorous as it sounds, drug stores are perfect if you still want to look amazing wearing the make up you love at a price you'll love even more.

, Like the make up you wear to school, when you hang out with your friends, etc. If you're a make up fanatic, like most girls, and you can't go into a make up store without buying everything in sight, this list will be a big help.

, There will most likely be lots of different kinds of a certain type of make up, like eyeliner. There will be pencil eyeliner in all different shades, and liquid eyeliner in all different shades. If you want to stick to your budget, you'll have to pick just one. Narrow your choice down to the type of make up you want with the best price. See an amazing black liquid eyeliner for just $3? Buy it! See an extra amazing green liquid eyeliner for $7? Leave it.

Decide if a cat is right for you.,
Choose a reputable breeder.,
Consider alternatives.,
Visit the cat before you buy it.,
Be patient.",How to Identify a Maine Coon3," Like all cats, Maine Coons are an investment of both time and money. They can cost anywhere from $400 to $1,000, and they also require ongoing costs like cat food, cat litter, and vet visits. Plus, since Maine Coons are relatively outgoing, they require some attention and affection every day. If you are a busy person, consider a pet that requires less energy.If you want a less energetic Maine Coon, think about getting a full-grown cat instead of a kitten.

, Reputable breeders will not have Maine Coons (or any other breed) available year-round. They will also not accept purchases online or have multiple litters on their premises. Instead, they’ll insist on a strict contract that describes what happens in case you can no longer take care of the cat, and provide as much information as possible about the cat’s pedigree and health.Contact the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association for a list of reputable breeders in your area.

, Buying your Maine Coon from a breeder is the most common way to get one. But you could also get your Maine Coon from a rescue organization like Maine Coon Adoptions or Maine Coon Rescue. Contact one of these organizations or a similar group about getting a Maine Coon., Reputable breeders or cat sellers will welcome you to visit the cat in the location where the cat was raised. The cat should be raised indoors. Be wary of breeders who try to meet you in a location that is not the place where the Maine Coon was raised (typically the breeder’s home).If you see that the Maine Coon was raised in a small, dirty, or crowded pen, choose another breeder. These conditions suggest that the cat might have fleas or illnesses.
Likewise, do not obtain a cat that was raised in isolation, as it may have difficulty socializing with other pets or people when introduced to your home.

, Maine Coons will probably not be available right away. Cats raised properly need to be about 12 to 16 weeks old before they can be separated from their mothers. Additionally, many breeders have wait lists that prevent quick and easy purchase of a Maine Coon."

Buy food grade mineral oil.,
Wipe the entire surface of the bowl with mineral oil.,
Let the bowl sit overnight.,
Wipe the excess oil off of the bowl with a clean paper towel.",How to Clean Wooden Bowls3," Wooden bowls can become dry and may eventually crack, so it is important to treat them with oil sometimes. When you’re looking for oil at the store, make sure it is labeled as food grade. You may also find mineral oil that specifically says it is for cutting boards, butcher blocks, or wooden dishware.You may find mineral oil that is not specifically labelled as food grade. Some of this is safe for consumption and some of it isn’t. If you’re unsure, look for “white mineral oil,” as this is the kind that has been refined enough for consumption.

, Take a clean, dry paper towel and pour a small circle of mineral oil onto it. Wipe the bowl completely, inside and outside, with the mineral oil. Apply the oil in some kind of pattern to make sure you don’t mis any spots.Don’t be afraid of putting too much oil on the bowl. If it seems like the first application soaked into the bowl, put a second, or even third, coat onto it.
Depending on how much you use your bowls. Treat them with mineral oil every couple of months or at least two times a year.

, Set the bowl on a clean spot on the counter or table and leave it overnight. The oil will soak partially into the wood, moisturizing it and coating the surface. If you are in a hurry, try to let the oil sit for at least 30 minutes.Allowing the mineral oil to sit for a short time will still help the bowls last, but not as well as letting the oil soak in for longer.

, After the bowl has sat and soaked in most of the oil, take another dry paper towel and wipe the entire surface of the bowl. There will be some oil that doesn’t soak into the wood, and it is best to remove this excess. Discard the paper towel afterward.


Put them back in the cabinet for later use, or go ahead and use them now. The purpose of using food grade oil is that it’s safe for consumption.

For example the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine are both neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system that are derived biochemically from the amino acid tyrosine.",How to Understand the Biological Importance of Amino Acids in the Body of Humans," This article tries to emphasize the importance of amino acids and their derivatives in the body of humans and in mammalians in general. Nature has selected these organic compounds as building blocks of macromolecules in the body that serve important functions that sustain states of homeostasis in the body or put it in simple words it supports the maintaining of life in the individuals. Amino acids are among many other chemical compounds that have biological importance in living systems of variable structural complexities. It is known experimentally the role of these organic amino acids in the body of humans. Their importance in the body stems from the fact that they are used as the building blocks of proteins in the body.;
, Proteins are polymers of amino acids that have diverse structural and functional roles in the body of humans. These proteins are constructed biochemically in the cells of the body using metabolic reactions that are very organized and accurate in its chemical selectivity as far as metabolic products are concerned. Besides its use in constructing proteins in the various cells of the body amino acids have other biological uses in the body of humans. This includes their use as chemical precursors for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters of neurons of the nervous system.

, These neurotransmitters are very important for the normal functioning of the various branches of the nervous system in humans. For this reason the study of the chemistry of amino acids at the biochemical level is very crucial to the understanding of the various metabolic products that arise from these amino acids in the body. There are 20 known amino acids in the body of humans. Also there are unusual types of amino acids that have no biological roles that are concerned with the production of proteins in the body such the atypical amino acid that is called gamma-amino-butyric-acid or shortly GABA. This atypical amino acid is known experimentally to have biological effect on the central nervous system that is inhibitory in its biological nature. Most information about the biological effects of these amino acids come from experimental observations from experiments on laboratory animals. Amino acids are unusual organic compounds that have both amino group and a carboxyl group on the same molecule.

, This chemical structure is very unusual in the sense that this type of compounds contains both an acid and a base at the same molecule that are adjacent to each other within the molecule. This chemical structure of amino acids is pH dependent. This means that deprotonation of the Bronsted carboxylic acid is dependent on the pH or acidity of the blood or the solution that contains them. Humans have the biochemical machinery to synthesize part of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. They are synthesized in the cells of the body using specific metabolic reactions that are catalyzed by using specific enzymes that serve this function of amino acids synthesis.

, Unfortunately not all 20 amino acids that are usually incorporated into the molecular skeleton of all proteins in the body are possible to synthesize in the body. This is so due to the absence of suitable metabolic pathways in the body which are specific for the synthesis of these essential amino acids in the body. Also there is absence of suitable enzymes for catalyzing these absent biochemical processes of essential amino acids synthesis in the body.

, The metabolic pathways for the biochemical synthesis of these nonessential amino acids are well known and have been reported in the various chemical literature. Their incorporation into the molecular structure of proteins is also a well known biochemical process that is called translational process. This process of proteins translation is based on genetic coding of amino acids using codons of DNA bases. Each codon constitutes of three DNA bases that code for one amino acid. These amino acids are transported in the cells to a cellular organ that is called a ribosome. At this site all amino acids are combined together to form the molecular structure of the specific protein that they serve to synthesize.

, This translational process is very dependent on the normal function of the genetic material in the particular cell that is used to synthesize the specific protein. Defects in the genetic material of the body cell can lead to defective biochemical synthesis of proteins that can be very crucial to the normal body function. This can occur for example with the biochemical synthesis of key enzymes in the body. Enzymes are one type of proteins that serve as catalysts for biochemical reactions in the body. These enzymes are a special class of enzymes that differ than other types of proteins by the presence of active site within their structure. This active site is known to be the place where the catalysis of certain biochemical reactions occurs. Amino acids in this active site are also suspected to participate in the catalytic process of the various metabolic reactions in the body. Also amino acids have biological roles that are concerned with the biochemical production of neurotransmitters in the neurons of the nervous system. Most known neurotransmitters of the nervous system of humans are derivatives of amino acids.

, These two neurotransmitters have biological effects on activating the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in humans. Also other known neurotransmitters that are synthesized from amino acids precursors include the two neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. These two neurotransmitters have psychiatric effects such as their effects on the mood of the person and their effect on the cognitive function of his brain. Some other amino acids are known to be neurotransmitters of the neurons of nervous system by themselves. An example is the amino acid glycine. Other atypical amino acid that has function as a neurotransmitter is called GABA. This atypical amino acid is known experimentally to induce sedative effects on patients that administer this amino acid. This amino acid is not incorporated into the structure of all proteins in the body of humans but is used clinically to treat patients that have episodes of anxiety and who suffer from panic attacks.

, Echidnas tend to tear off the bark in long strips, usually from logs.

, Echidnas that are using the are for finding ants or termites may dig in places other than ant or termite nests. However, they don't only eat ants and termites. They're quite happy to eat other creatures such as earthworms, beetles and moth larvae, so scrounging with their sharp claws may occur anywhere.

Avoid being a social media stalker.,
Let the relationship progress naturally.,
Spend time with your friends.,
Do not be clingy.",How to Avoid Being Desperate (Girls)3," A modest amount of social media stalking is pretty standard when you start dating someone, just keep it from getting creepy. You can secretly look at every photo of them for the last four years without scaring them off, but try to avoid making it obvious you're watching their every move. Limit your comments and likes to one or two a week. You should have better things to do, even if you don't have better things to do.

, Desperate people often look to push the relationship too fast. Don't bring up topics like marriage or even make too many references to future dates early in the relationship. Desperate daters are often asking for continual status updates on the relationship and trying to push for more commitment in various ways. Just let things happen and if you are right for each other, it will work out in time., Just because you start dating someone, don't put aside your friends to spend all your time with him. Anyone that drops all their friends for a new date, will come off as very desperate. You can't make yourself too available and you don't want to come off as clingy. Staying true to yourself and your friends will set up healthy boundaries and expectations for a happy relationship.

, By holding on too tightly, you can drive a love interest away. If the guy is right for you and the relationship is going well, he will stick around. If it isn't meant to be, no amount of clinging is going to make it happen. Most of the time, it isn't even the guy you're clinging to, it's the idea of needing a relationship.

Put your jeans on.,
Fill the bathtub with hot water.,
Get in the bathtub.,
Sit out in the sun until dry.",How to Shrink Jeans3," Slip on the loose pair of jeans, zippering and buttoning them up as usual.

This is the only method in which you must wear your jeans as you shrink them.
Since you will be shrinking your jeans as you wear them, the jeans will shrink around your legs, create a perfect, snug fit.
You should begin this process on the same day you plan to wear your jeans. If this is not possible, then use this method to shrink your jeans a day or two before you wear them. Do not wash the jeans after shrinking them, though, since doing so could cause the fibers to relax and ease back into their original, loose position.

, Fill the tub with enough hot water to cover your legs and waist completely.

Make the water as hot as you can tolerate. Obviously, you want to avoid burning yourself with water that is too hot to handle, but lukewarm water will not be able to cause the fibers to contract enough for sufficient shrinkage.
Test the temperature of the water with your hand to gauge how hot it is.

, Slowly ease yourself into the hot water while still wearing your jeans. Remain in the bathtub until the water cools to room temperature.

If you made the water sufficiently hot, it should take at least 20 minutes for the water to cool.
Make sure that your jeans are completely submerged under the water. If your legs or part of your waistband remain above water, add more hot water to the bathtub until these exposed portions are submerged, as well.

, Air dry your jeans so that they conform to the shape of your legs.

If possible, sit outside in a sunny location to do this. Make sure to choose a hot day to prevent yourself from getting sick and to help the jean fibers continue to contract.
Sit in a plastic or metal chair. Avoid absorbent surfaces that may soak up the water from your jeans.
You may need to turn yourself as you sit or lie out in the sun. Otherwise, the tops of your legs will dry while the back will remain wet.
It can take several hours for your jeans to dry.

Think about what you value.There’s no one formula for determining what sled dog is right for your team.,
Choose an Alaskan husky.Alaskan huskies (also called Indian dogs) are the most common dogs in dog sled races.,
Choose a Malamute.Malamutes are excellent sled dogs and are bred for raw power.,
Choose a Siberian husky.Huskies are smaller than Malamutes (usually weighing 40-60 pounds) and have lower endurance levels.,
Choose a Canadian Eskimo dog.",How to Care for Sled Dogs4," A good sled dog will demonstrate a combination of endurance, speed, pulling ability, and perseverance. Sled dogs should also have a certain level of intelligence -- an ability to listen for and obey commands, actively avoid obstacles, and take care of themselves. A thick coat is a must for dogs running long-distance sleds in cold weather. Finally, your dog should be healthy and fit to endure the intense training and distances required of sled dogs.


Your sled dogs don’t need to be of just one breed, but they all need to be able to work together without conflict. Dogs that cause conflicts with others should be removed from the team.
If your dog is puling a sled over a shorter distance and time (two hours or less), it does not need to have such a thick coat.

, This “breed” is actually a mutt -- a cross between Siberian huskies and another breed, which varies. Some Alaskan huskies have wolf ancestry, others have greyhound, German shorthair pointer, hound, or terrier blood.


Wolf-dog mixes can be unpredictable and difficult to train. Use caution if purchasing or employing a husky with a close wolf ancestor.

, One popular variety of Malamute, the freight dog, has high endurance and excels at long trips, though it is not very fast. They usually weigh 80-120 pounds.


Popular depictions of dog sled races usually feature Malamutes or huskies.

, Over a short period of time, though, huskies can pull more than Malamutes. Purebred Siberian huskies are mostly bred for appearance, not pulling ability, and usually make poor sled dogs.

, Like other sled dogs, the Canadian Eskimo dog is muscular and built for pulling. It can cover 15 to 70 miles per day, and is capable of pulling up to 80 kilograms.Don’t confuse the Canadian Eskimo dog with the American Eskimo dog, which has a a short, white, and dense coat.

Practice before wearing your eyelashes out.",How to Wear Magnetic False Eyelashes," This is especially important if you are new to magnetic false eyelashes as you will apply them less gracefully when initially using them. Put all your other makeup on first before applying your magnetic false eyelashes. Otherwise, the lashes could smudge your other makeup during the application process., Magnetic false lashes only cover the outer corners of your eyes. Apply mascara to the lashes on the inner corner of your eye before applying false lashes. This will balance out the look.Opt for a mascara tube that comes with a smaller brush. This makes it easier to target only a small portion of your lashes.

, Liquid eyeliner tends to stick to false eyelashes. This can decrease how long they last. If you wear eyeliner, opt for pencil eyeliner when wearing magnetic false eyelashes.In general, any liquid-based makeup should not be used around your eyes when you're wearing false eyelashes.

, Be very careful not to get mascara on your false eyelashes. Keeping false eyelashes clean will help them last longer. Remember to only apply mascara before applying your magnetic lashes., Wherever you're applying your lashes, lay a microfiber cloth down in front of you. Set your magnetic false eyelashes on this cloth. If they fall while you're applying them, they'll be easier to find if they land on the cloth., The top lash strip should be labeled with a dot or other marking. Refer to your package's instructions to figure out how your top strip is labeled. Remove the top strip and place it just over your eyelashes near the outer corner of your eye. Get the top lash strip as close to your lash line as possible., The bottom lash strip will be marked by a different color dot. Use your thumb and index finger to pick up the bottom lash strip. Place it just underneath the top lash strip. The magnets should click in place., When you want to remove the lashes, gently grab them between your thumb and index finger. Shift them between your fingers until you feel the magnets come apart. Then, carefully pull the magnetic lashes away from your eyelashes.Magnetic eye lashes are reusable and can be used multiple times before they need replacing. When you take them out, put them back in their original container for later use. Keep the container in a safe space where it will not get damaged.

, Any time you're touching your eyes and eyelids, you should wash your hands. Wet your hands with clean water, lather them with soap, and then scrub them for about 20 seconds before rinsing. Dry your hands using a clean towel., You may need to adjust the eyelashes a few times to get them in the right position. Allow your other eye makeup to dry and set before applying the lashes. It may be a good idea to wear minimal makeup around your eyes until you're used to applying your lashes., It can take awhile to get used to using magnetic lashes. Practice before you wear the lashes out, as they may look awkward the first few times you put them on."

Punch holes into the leather.,
Sew the pockets to the base.,
Determine where to place your snaps.,
Attach the snaps.,
Punch holes along the perimeter of the wallet.,
Stitch the wallet together.",How to Make a Wallet1," Use chalk or a pencil to mark the dimensions of your leather before cutting the pieces out. You will need to mark out a large piece of moose skin for the body or base of the wallet and several smaller pieces of embossed cowhide for change pockets and card pockets.


The moose skin should be be roughly 11 inches (28 cm) long by 7.5 inches (19 cm) wide.
Each card pocket should measure roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long by 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Make anywhere from one to three card pockets.
The change pocket should be about 3 inches (7.5 cm) by 3 inches (7.5 cm).;
, Place your leather on the cutting board and use a sharp utility knife to cut out the pieces along the lines your marked. Cut out the body of the wallet and each pocket.


You also need to create two snap tabs on the leather used for the body of the wallet. The snap tabs should be about 2 inches (5 cm) by 2 inches (5 cm) and both placed on the left side of the leather. Cut away about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the top and bottom of the tabs and cut out about 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) from in between the two tabs.

, Lay the card pockets on top of one another so that the top 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of each patch remains visible. Center this in the upper right quarter of the wallet body. Center the change pocket in the upper left quarter of the wallet body.


Use tape or thick, sharp sewing pins to hold the pockets in place.

, Use a rotary punch to punch holes in the card pockets, change pocket, and the leather directly beneath both sets of pockets.


Punch holes into the leather while the pockets are pinned or taped down to the body of the wallet. This ensures that the holes will be correctly aligned.
Place a piece of thick leather hide below your wallet as you use the rotary punch. Doing so makes it easier to punch holes in the leather.
Do not punch holes along the top of the pocket.

, Thread a sewing needle with waxed thread and stitch each pocket to the body of the wallet. Sew the pockets by weaving the thread in and out of the holes created with your rotary punch.


Start from the inside of the wallet to hide the knot. The inside of the wallet will be the side with the pocket facing up.
Do not stitch along the top of each pocket.
Stitch each pocket onto the wallet twice for added strength.
If desired, use a lighter to carefully and slightly burn the knot, melting the wax together for a more permanent hold.
Remove the tape or pins when done.

, Fold and close the wallet. Fold the snap tab over and mark where the snap should go using your Glover's needle.


Fold the bottom of the wallet body up to cover the pockets. The two snap tabs should line up.
Fold the wallet again, bringing the right side over on top of the left side.
Fold the snap tabs over so that they overlap onto the top of the wallet.
Pierce through the two snap tabs and top layer of your wallet using your needle.

, Use your rotary tool to punch a hole for both sides of the snap button by punching a hole through all the places marked with your needle. Attach the snaps onto your wallet using a bout press and mallet.


Place the male portion of the snap on the inside of the snap tab and the female portion on the body of the wallet.
Note that both the male portion and female portion of the snap are split into two parts that must be hammered together, sandwiching the leather in between.
Pinch the two halves of the male side together using the concave side of a bout press. One side should be on the outside of the snap tab and the other should be on the inside.
Use a mallet or hammer to gently hammer the two pieces together.
Repeat this procedure with the female side of the snap.

Pick an appropriate, comfortable outfit for the audition.",How to Audition for TV Shows2," Depending on the show and the network, you may receive a script, or you may get lines to read right on the spot, sometimes known as a cold-read.If you've received the script, make sure to study and memorize your lines carefully. If you have to select the material yourself, make sure to pick out a piece that will allow you to show a dynamic range.


Don't choose a script that only shows one emotion like anger or sadness.
Use personally relevant pieces and stay away from experimental scripts, or scripts that don't show off your true acting ability. , The more you practice cold-reading, the more you'll become accustomed to taking on a new role with only a couple of minutes to prepare. When you receive a script to cold-read, don't panic and try to memorize the entire script. Instead, relax, read the script carefully, then try to understand the circumstances of the story, your characters motivations, and how the scene affects the plot.


Do not look down at your script while the casting agent is reading lines. Casting directors want to be able to gauge your acting abilities, which includes reacting to events in the story or lines in the dialogue., TV is a visual medium, and much of your acting will take place in your face. You can also see how your acting looks on film and alter it to become a better actor or actress. Take note of your facial expressions and any bad habits that you have so you can try to alter them.Bad habits include a noticeable twitch or facial gesture that you do habitually. Take notice of the way you pronounce words and make sure that you enunciate.

, A TV actor who has experience can provide you with valuable insider knowledge of how auditions and casting work in your area. Talk to friends in the industry or ask a teacher if you're taking an acting class. They can also help you with your audition.


You can ask by saying, ""Hey, I have an audition coming up, and I wanted to get some feedback on my performance. I need someone to be completely honest and objective so that I can land this role.""

, You should choose an outfit that embodies the character that you are auditioning for, but also remember to wear something that's comfortable. Coming in with an unrequested costume will not win you over to casting directors, and could cost you the audition.Wearing something comfortable will put you at ease and give you the confidence to concentrate on acting.

Familiarize yourself with leaderships styles.,
Assess the circumstances around your leadership role.,
Use your analysis of the circumstances involved around your leadership task in order to choose the most appropriate of the leadership styles.",How to Choose a Leadership Pattern,"


Authoritarian/Autocratic. This approach to leadership puts the bulk of decision-making and executive functions on you, the leader, and lessens the autonomy of those you are leading. This leadership pattern is useful in situations with heavy time restraints, in which you know the most about what needs to be done and how to do it. Otherwise, in more long-term situations that require greater employee input and responsibility, this dominating style of leadership should be avoided.
Participative/Democratic. This managerial style promotes the involvement of those you are leading. You are responsible for overseeing the task, delegating responsibilities and making final decisions, but your employees are responsible for giving input in regards to getting their tasks done most efficiently. This will generally yield better results than an authoritarian style, as it encourages everyone to be accountable and it promotes positive morale.
Delegative/Free reign. Use a delegative leadership pattern when you trust the competency, efficiency and dedication of those you are leading. Allowing this type of autonomy amongst the members of your task force allows you to focus on other, more pressing matters, but it does not negate your responsibility in ensuring the quality of the finished product.;
, Take the following things into consideration before choosing a managerial style:


Those you will be leading. Take note of how long they have been in their positions so you know if they need to be taught, guided or delegated responsibilities.
Critique the relationship between yourself and those you are responsible for leading. Gauging levels of familiarity and respect is important to choosing a leadership pattern.
The task at hand. Consider the many variables involved in completing the task, including time to complete, training necessary to complete, stressors involved with such a task, amount of structure required by the task and the need for individual versus teamwork-type participation.

, Ideally, your role as a leader should utilize not just 1 style, but aspects from each of the leadership patterns, as they apply to the specifics of your task.

",How to Make Ron Ron Juice3," A powerful blender can mix ingredients more easily. If you're working with a small blender, without a lot of different speed settings, cut your fruit into very small pieces. This can help your juice mix smoothly even if your blender is on the weak side., Even strong blenders sometimes slow down, especially when dealing with ingredients like fruit. If your blender is stalling, turn it off. Then, use a spoon to push the ingredients around.

Get the necessary equipment.,
Consider special niches.,
Research a good deal of your time in industry is going to be in the area of research.,
If you are new to the grant writing industry, consider these several ways to enhance your ability to make a living form grant writing:


Take a course or two on grant writing from your local community college or university.,
Research how much money you can make as a freelancer.,
Market yourself.",How to Become a Freelance Grant Writer," You will need an up-to-date computer (you may choose either an Apple Computer or a Windows based computer). Whichever one you choose go with either a Notebook or laptop style computer. Either one will make your life easier when you start to make trips to your local library to conduct research or to call on clients.


If you choose a Windows based computer, get one that has either Windows 8 or 8.1 as the operating system. If you decide to wait on a new computer you might like the new Windows 10.0 operating system. If you choose to go with an Apple computer get one with the OS X  Snow Leopard operating system.
Regardless of which computer system you choose, make sure you keep up with the latest updates for either model. In addition to the software that comes installed on your computer it is essential that you have a solid word processing package like MS Word and an accounting package such as Excel.
Most nonprofit organizations use MS Word and Excel. This will make your life, as well as that of your clients, much more pleasant when sending documents, attachments and spreadsheets back and forth.
Get a solid laser printer (many grant makers specify all printing be laser printing), a land-line telephone as well as a cell phone, a reliable Internet provider and both a fax machine and a separate fax telephone number, business cards and a viable website.

, Most successful grant proposal writers have a specialized niche or industry for which they write grant proposals.A niche is generally based on something that you have experience with, such as employment, or a cause or project that you may have volunteering experience with.


Write in the area of Children’s Sports, Public Safety and Homeless Veterans causes. Regardless of what niche you choose, it is always a good idea to remain available to write on just about any subject matter that presents itself. You do not have to be an expert on all aspects or causes, just be able to conduct research on the topic and take good notes.
Learn as quickly as possible all of the key terms associated with the topic, read as much as possible about the subject on the internet and take as many notes as possible so that you can talk intelligently with your client about the subject.

, Researching your client, the subject matter of the grant itself, who are the grant makers, what grants are available and how much grant money is available for a certain type of grant and many other topics. This will be a very large part of your billing to your client.


Decide to bill for research independent of the actual grant writing, or you may decide to include it all together, but it will behoove you to keep a record of the actual time you spend on research and make sure you bill accordingly.
If you take the time to engage in a grant proposal writing service then contact someone in your area, like the Y.W.C.A. or American Red Cross and ask them if they may have several older copies of grant proposals that you could have to read and study.
Explain to them that you are new to grant writing and would like to read complete and funded grant proposals. If you have a college or university in your area contact them for additional grant proposals that you might read. Almost any non-profit organization will have copies of older grant proposals that they will gladly give you copies. From these you will learn more of what makes a winning grant proposal than from most books.

,
Volunteer at any nonprofit organization in your area, ask to volunteer in the grant department.
Read the book Grants for Dummies, available at your local book store. Make sure to get the latest edition.
Go on line and watch any number of grant writing seminars

, For those individuals who are just entering the grant profession as a novice freelancer you are probably wondering how much money you might expect to make.


As a freelancer you can expect, depending on how well you market yourself, on your writing skills, and if your website if you have one. The national average for a novice proposal writer is about $39,000 per year. Those individuals with 3-5 year experience may expect a yearly income of approximately $69,000. (wageindicator.org).
At the same time there are conditions that you have little or no control over, such as the time of year you enter the field, the local and national economy, how much money Congress has set aside for government grants and just how generous foundations are feeling from one particular year to the next.. For example, Google the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest foundations in existence and see how much they give from year to year.
Also try any of the larger foundations such as Walmart Foundation, the National Football Foundation or any others you may be curious about. After you have checked out some of your favorite foundations, congratulate yourself, you have just started to learn the lesson of grant research. A skill that is vital to your Grant Proposal Business.

, The final, and for some, the hardest step is marketing yourself This means contacting nonprofit organizations in your area to start with. As you grown in experience you may choose to take on clients nationally.


If you do not have any grant proposals that you have written that you can show potential clients, but have volunteered and been a part of grant writing team, ask that non-profit organization to write you a recommendation that you can present to potential clients.
Remember not to take it personally if you get turned down by a potential client. Take time to thank them, once you have more experience you may approach them again.

Follow the instructions on the notice.",How to Join a Harmful Drug Class Action Lawsuit1," Particularly if you were harmed by a prescription drug, you may receive a notice regarding any existing class action lawsuit.If you receive a notice, it means you've been identified as a potential member of the class.
For example, the attorneys representing the plaintiffs may have received a list of patients who were prescribed the drug by their doctors.
Since information about purchasers is more difficult to find, it's unlikely you'll receive a notice if you were harmed by an over-the-counter medication.
The notice itself may contain very little information about the lawsuit itself or the harms suffered by the plaintiffs. However, it typically will list a website you can visit or phone number you can call for more information.;
, You may have several options available, depending on how far along the litigation has progressed.If you've received a notice informing you that a judge has certified the class, you may have the ability of opting out, being included in the class, or even participating as a named plaintiff.
You may want to consider participating as a named plaintiff if you suffered a serious injury or spent a lot of money on treatment as a result of the harm caused by the drug's side effects.
However, if the notice you receive is a notice of settlement, typically your only options are either to accept the settlement or opt out.
If your injuries are significant, you may want to opt out and sue the company on your own if you don't believe your share of settlement proceeds would adequately cover your losses.

, In most cases a notice is sent to inform you that you have automatically been included in a class, but you still may need to contact an attorney.For example, if you've decided you'd like to participate in the lawsuit as a named plaintiff, you typically will need your own attorney.
You can contact the attorneys listed on the notice to find out more about what you should do if you want to join the harmful drug class action lawsuit.
However, you also may want to talk to an attorney near you who has experience with harmful drug class actions. That attorney can evaluate your case and give you advice on whether you should join the class action lawsuit, file a lawsuit yourself, or do something else.

, The notice should provide details on how to communicate your decision regarding the lawsuit.The notice typically will have contact information for the attorneys or law firm representing the plaintiffs. Depending on the scope of the lawsuit, there may be different attorneys in charge of plaintiffs in different regions of the country.
The notice also may have a phone number you can call, or a website you can visit, if you want to opt out of the class and any settlement. If you were automatically put on the class's registry, you must act to have your name removed.
If you decide you want to pursue your own lawsuit, make sure your name is removed from the class's registry before the deadline listed on the notice. Otherwise you'll lose your right to file your own lawsuit.

Exercise regularly.,

Fix your sleeping position.",How to Make Yourself Tired So That You'll Fall Asleep2," Working out during the day is an incredibly effective way to rest better at night. In fact, exercise seems to correspond so directly with sleep quality that many of our hypotheses about the purpose of sleep stem from our observations of how exercising depletes our energy reserves.Just be sure not to exercise within three hours of bedtime, as it can have a temporary stimulating effect., Make a stop at the bathroom just before bed. This will help you to clear your digestive system so that you fall asleep more easily — and stay asleep throughout the night. In the same vein, don’t drink large amounts of fluids in the hours leading up to your bedtime and which might wake you up in the middle of the night. Limit what you drink after about 8 pm., Make your body as comfortable as you can for sleep. If some of your clothing feels tight, don't hesitate to loosen or remove it. This includes your hair bands, socks, bra, and anything else that might feel like it's not letting blood circulate freely. Make sure that you have enough pillows and blankets to be comfy, as well.

, If you pay attention to how you sleep, you might notice that you are sleeping in a bad position or putting strain on your posture. Keep your back straight and make sure your neck is not resting too high or too low. If your bed is too firm or too soft, consider replacing it, covering it with a foam pad, or even sleeping with a body pillow to make yourself more comfortable.

Be wary of logs and leafy areas.,
Look for king snakes climbing trees.,
Check for defensive behavior.,
Watch out for a coral snake's distinctive bite.",How to Tell the Difference Between a King Snake and a Coral Snake2," Both coral snakes and scarlet king snakes like to spend their daytime hours under logs and leaf piles on the ground. They may also be found in caves and crevices in rocks. Be very careful when lifting a rock or log, or entering an underground space., If you see a colorful snake with a ring pattern climbing a tree, it's probably a nonvenomous king snake. Coral snakes very rarely climb trees. You should still look carefully to make sure it's not a coral snake, and play it safe by not getting too close.

, When coral snakes feel threatened, they move their tails and heads back and forth in order to try to confuse their predators. King snakes don't display this behavior. If you see a snake wagging its head and tail strangely, it's probably a coral, so stay back.Coral snakes are very reclusive, and it's extremely rare to see them in the wild. They only strike when they feel extremely threatened, so if you see one displaying this behavior, you'll probably have time to get away.
King snakes received their name because they eat other types of snakes, including venomous ones. They don't tend to display this sort of defensive behavior, although they have been known to hiss and shake their tails like rattlesnakes.

, In order to inject its venom, a coral snake must clamp down and chew its prey. Since it's usually possible to fling the snake off before it has time to fully inject venom, people rarely die from coral snake bites. However, left untreated, a coral snake bite can lead to cardiac arrest and death.A coral snake bite is not extraordinarily painful at first. However, if venom has been injected, the victim will experience slurred speech, double vision, and paralysis so even if you don't feel anything after a coral snake bite still call emergency services.If you ever get bitten by a coral snake, stay calm, remove constrictive clothing and jewelry and get medical help immediately."

Grow from discomfort.",How to Come out of One's Shell," There’s a difference between being an introvert and being so shy that you can’t have a conversation with a person at a party. Introversion is a personality trait: it’s what makes you happy and comfortable. Shyness, on the other hand, comes from fear or anxiety about interacting with others. Learning to tell whether you’re an introvert or just shy can help you break out of your shell.Introverts tend to enjoy solitude. They feel “recharged” by being alone. They enjoy hanging out with people, but they usually prefer to do it in small groups and have quiet gatherings rather than big parties. If you feel happy and comfortable on your own, like it’s meeting a need you have, you may be introverted.Shyness can cause anxiety over interacting with others. Unlike introverts, who enjoy being alone, people who are shy often wish they could interact more with others but feel afraid to do so.Research has demonstrated that shyness and introverted have a very low correlation -- in other words, being shy doesn’t mean you’re introverted, and being introverted doesn’t mean you “hate people.”You can take a shyness quiz online from Wellesley College to determine how shy you are.A score of above 49 indicates that you’re very shy, between 34-49 that you’re kind of shy, and below 34 that you’re not very shy.;
, It's hard to come out of your shell when you feel like others are scrutinizing everything about you. But science shows that we’re our own worst critics -- most of the time, others don’t even notice the faux pas we may think are catastrophic. Learn to examine your actions from a place of acceptance and understanding rather than criticism.Self-consciousness comes from a place of embarrassment and shame. We worry that others are judging us as harshly as we’re judging ourselves for our mistakes and slip-ups.
For example, a self-conscious thought might be, ""I can't believe I just said that. I sound like a complete idiot."" This thought judges you and does not offer any help for the future.
A self-aware thought might be, “Whoops, I completely blanked on that person’s name! I’ll have to figure out some strategies to remember others’ names better.” This thought acknowledges that you flubbed something, but doesn’t make it the end of the world. It also acknowledges that you can learn to do things differently in the future.

, People who have trouble coming out of their shells are often plagued by the idea that the people around them are watching their every move, waiting for them to fail.When you're in a social situation, do you spend all your time scrutinizing every single action of every single person in the room? Of course not -- you're too busy focusing on the things that are actually important to you. And guess what? Most people are the same way.”Personalization” is a common cognitive distortion, or unhelpful way of thinking that your brain has made a habit. Personalization blames you for things that really aren’t your responsibility. It can make you take everything personally, even when it has nothing to do with you.Learn to challenge personalization by reminding yourself that it isn’t actually all about you. That coworker who didn’t return your friendly wave probably isn’t mad at you; she might not have seen you, or she might be having a hard day, or she might be worried about things that you’re not even aware of. Remembering that every person has a rich internal life of thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires can help remind you that most people are too busy to spend their time scrutinizing you.

, You may be afraid to come out of your shell because you're constantly reminding yourself of all of the things you did to screw up a social situation. You might walk away thinking, ""I was way too quiet,"" ""The only comment I made was completely idiotic,"" or ""I think I offended so-and so..."" Well, sure, we all make social faux pas, but we all also succeed socially as well. Instead of obsessing over the worst things you might or might not have done, focus on the positives. Remind yourself that you were able to make people laugh, that they looked genuinely happy to see you, or that you made a great point about something.


”Filtering” is another common cognitive distortion. It happens when you focus only on what went wrong, and ignore anything that went right. This is a natural human tendency.Fight back against filtering by being more mindful of your experiences and actively acknowledging what goes right. You could keep a little notebook with you and write down whenever something positive happens, no matter how minor it may seem to you. You could even keep a Twitter or Instagram account to record these little moments.
When you find yourself thinking thoughts that focus on the negative, pull out your list of positive things and remind yourself that you do plenty of things well. And what you aren’t great at right now, you can learn!

, If you want to come out of your shell, then you have to develop your confidence and be happy with who you are. If you're happy with who you are, then you'll be more likely to share who you are with other people. Think about the things that make you a special person: your quirky sense of humor, your experiences from traveling, the intelligence you've gained from reading so much. Be proud of the things that make you you and remind yourself that you do have qualities that are worth sharing the next time you step out into the world.


Make a list of all the things that make you proud of yourself in some way.
Nothing is too “minor” for this list! We often make a habit of minimizing our own talents and accomplishments (another cognitive distortion), assuming that whatever we know isn’t as cool as what everyone else knows. But not everyone knows how to play the ukulele or make perfect scrambled eggs or find the best shopping deals. Whatever you can do, be proud of it.

, Before you walk into a social situation, picture yourself walking into a room proud and tall, having people be genuinely happy to see you, and making them respond positively to a social interaction with you. You don't have to picture yourself as the center of attention (in fact, that's probably the last thing you want!), but you should picture the outcome that you want. It’ll help you work to achieve it.There are two types of visualization, and you need to use both for the best results. With “outcome visualization,” you imagine yourself achieving your goal. Close your eyes and picture how your next social interaction will be fun and enjoyable. Picture your body language, words, and movements, as well as the positive reactions of other people. Imagine them smiling at you, laughing at your jokes, and being genuinely happy to hang out with you.
With “process visualization,” you have to imagine the steps you need to take to achieve your goal. For example, to get to that easy, relaxed social interaction, what did that hypothetical future-you do? Prep a few “small-talk” topics? Pump yourself up with a few positive affirmations beforehand? What actions will increase your likelihood of success?
Visualization is essentially mental “rehearsal.” It allows you to “practice” a situation before you go through with it. You can also identify potential snags and come up with ways to beat them.
Visualizing can help you accomplish your goals because it can actually trick your brain into believing you’ve already been successful at them., Another way to build your confidence and to get more pumped to talk to other people is to learn something new. This can be anything from figure skating to creative writing to Italian cooking. You don't have to be the best in the world at it; what’s important is that you work at it and acknowledge your successes. Mastering things will not only boost your confidence, it will also give you more to talk about with others and may help you make some friends along the way, too.If you're already good at something, awesome. Add it to your list of things that make you unique. And don't be afraid to try something else anyway.
Learning new skills also helps keep your brain sharp. When your brain is constantly challenged with new information and tasks, it has to become more flexible and adaptable -- and that’s excellent for helping you break out of your shell.Try a class! Whether it’s yoga for beginners or Italian Cooking 101, classes can be a great way to connect with others who are also learning something new to them. You’ll be able to see that everyone makes mistakes along the way to mastery, and you may even bond with people over your newfound passion.

, Staying in your shell can be comfortable. You know what you’re good at, and you never have to do anything that frightens you or makes you uncomfortable. The thing is, staying in your comfort zone kills creativity and exploration. Doing things you’ve never done before will help you come out of your shell.Pushing yourself past your comfort zone means acknowledging that fear and uncertainty exist, and that it’s okay to feel those things. You just can’t let those feelings keep you from exploring the world. If you practice taking risks even when you’re a little afraid, you’ll find it’s a lot easier to continue taking them.Psychologists have discovered that you actually need a little anxiety to make you more creative. People work harder when they feel slightly unsure of the situation, which leads to better performance, too.On the other hand, you don’t want to try too much too soon. Too much anxiety, and your brain will simply shut down. So push yourself a little bit at a time, but be patient with yourself.This doesn't mean you have to go skydiving if you're scared of being on a second floor balcony. But whether it's trying salsa dancing, going hiking, or making your own sushi, promise yourself that you’ll start doing things outside your comfort zone.

, One way to set yourself up for a social setback is to expect perfection immediately. Instead, boost your confidence by setting yourself some goals that seem challenging but doable. As your confidence levels increase, you can set yourself harder goals.Try to speak to just one person at a gathering. It can be overwhelming to go into a situation assuming that you have to “work the room” and interact with everyone, especially if you’ve just started working on coming out of your shell. Instead, plan to speak with just one person. That’s totally do-able! And when you’ve done it, you can add it to your mental “success shelf.”Look for other people who might be shy. You’re not the only person in the world who has trouble coming out of your shell! The next time you’re at a gathering, look around for someone else who looks uncomfortable or is standing off in a corner. Go over and introduce yourself. It could be that you’re the inspiration they need to come out of their shell a little bit too., Not every interaction will go as you hope. Not everyone will respond well to your approaches. Sometimes, you’ll say something that doesn’t go over well. That’s okay! Accepting the possibility of uncertainty and different outcomes than you’d planned for will help you stay open to connecting with others.Recasting setbacks or challenges as learning experiences can also help keep you from viewing them (or yourself) as a “failure.” When we wrongly think of ourselves as failures, we’re unmotivated to keep trying, because what’s the point? Instead, look for what you can learn from every situation, even the ones that were uncomfortable or didn’t go the way you’d hoped.
For example, you might try introducing yourself to someone at a party, but he isn’t interested in talking to you and turns away. This sucks, but guess what? It isn’t a failure; it's not really a mistake, either, since you had the strength and courage to put yourself out there. You may be able to learn some things from the experience too, such as observing signs that someone isn’t interested in having a conversation at that moment and realizing that the way other people act is not your fault.
When you’re feeling embarrassed by something, remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. Maybe you've asked someone how his girlfriend is doing when everyone else knew she dumped him weeks ago. Maybe you've found yourself talking too much about your childhood obsession with ferrets. All of that is okay -- we've all done it. The important thing is that you get knocked down, but you get up again. Don't let one social mistake keep you from trying in the future.

, Part of coming out of your shell is making people want to talk to you. You may be surprised to hear that people might think that you're stuck up or rude just because you're so shy that you can't even begin to think about giving people positive affirmation. This can change today. The next time someone comes up to you or starts talking to you, give that person a big smile, stand with your posture straight and your arms at your sides, and enthusiastically ask that person how he or she is doing. It takes practice to start looking friendly when you're used to retreating into your shell, but you can make it work.If you're shy, you may be used to hunching over a book or your cell phone, but this may make people think you're too busy to talk to them.
You can be approachable and look engaged even if you're shy. Even if you're not saying a lot, nodding, making eye contact, smiling at the right times, and generally looking like you're enjoying yourself are all signs of being an “active listener.”Active listening helps people feel like you’re interested and involved in the conversation. If you just hang back and stare at the floor, people might forget that you're there.
Try repeating a few key ideas from a conversation as the basis for your own contribution. This not only shows you’re listening, it helps other people feel acknowledged. For example, if you’ve been listening to someone talk about her trip to India, you could say something like “That sounds amazing! I’ve never been to India, but I did go to Indiana once.”
If talking about yourself seems too hard at the moment, this can be a tactic you can use until you comfortable sharing yourself a little more.

, Once you're having a conversation with people, a great default mode is to ask them a few simple questions, whether it's about themselves, their plans, or whatever it is that they are talking about. Asking questions is also a lower-pressure form of social interaction because you won't be talking about yourself as much, but will be showing interest and will move the conversation forward. You don't have to ask the person a million questions or sound like a detective and make him or her uncomfortable; just ask a friendly question when there's a lag in the conversation.Obviously, it's harder for shy people to just open up and start talking about themselves. This is a good way to start.
Open-ended questions invite the other person to share something about themselves, instead of a “yes” or “no” answer.
Some examples of open-ended questions include “Where did you find that awesome t-shirt?” or “What’s your favorite book and why?” or “Where’s the best place to get coffee around here?”

, Once you get more comfortable with the people you're talking to, or even with your friends, then you can slowly start to open up. You shouldn't share your deepest, darkest secrets first, obviously, but you can slowly reveal things little by little. Take the pressure off. Tell a funny story about one of your teachers. Show people a cute picture of Muffins, your pet rabbit. If someone talks about his trip to Vegas, talk about the awkward family trip you once took there. Baby steps are the key.


You can even start sharing a bit by saying, ""Me too,"" or ""I know exactly what you mean. One time I..."" when people relate their experiences.
Even sharing silly anecdotes or small details can get you ready to come out of your shell more. As people give you positive affirmation for what you say, you'll be more likely to keep opening up.
You don't have to be the first person to share something slightly person. Wait for a few other people to open up first.
Though talking about yourself incessantly is obviously rude, it can also be seen as rude to be completely closed off. If a person is sharing a lot with you, and all you say is ""Uh-huh..."" then the person may be hurt that you're not comfortable with sharing something yourself. Even a “Me too!” helps others feel more involved with you.

, There's nothing small about small talk. Many great friendships and relationships have started after a conversation about the weather or the local sports team. Some people say, ""I don't do small talk"" because they think it's superficial and a waste of time, but being able to make low-pressure simple conversation with new people is a building block to getting to know them on a deeper level. Small talk actually gives people the chance to socialize by using topics that aren't too personal. When people first meet each other, they decide what information to share of themselves that they would consider ""safe"" information. Small talk provides lots of opportunity to share safe information while taking small steps forward to establish trust. To make small talk, you just have to know how to make a person comfortable, politely ask questions, share something about yourself, and to keep up a steady flow of conversation.Use new people's names in conversation. This will make them feel like they matter to you.
Use cues to start a conversation. If the person is wearing a 49ers hat, you can ask if that's his favorite sports team, or how he became a fan.
You can make a simple statement followed by a question. For example, you can say, ""Man, the rain kept me in all weekend. I had to help my mom out with a bunch of chores. How about you? Did you do anything more exciting?""

, Reading people is a social skill that can help you make better conversation and to come out of your shell. Having a sense of whether a person is excited and ready to talk or distracted or in a bad mood can help you figure out what to talk about -- or whether or not you should talk to the person at all.


Understanding group dynamics is a must, too; does the group of people have a ton of inside jokes and have more difficulty accepting outsiders, or are the people up for anything? This can help you figure out how much to put yourself out there.
If someone is smiling and walking slowly like she has no place to go, then yeah, she'd rather talk to you than someone who is sweating bullets, furiously scrolling through his text messages, or walking a mile a minute.

, When you're talking to people, focus on what is happening: the nature of the conversation, the expression on the person's face, what everyone in the conversation is contributing, and so on. Don't fret about what you said five minutes ago or about what you'll say in five minutes when you have a chance to step in with a comment. Remember the part about letting go of your self-consciousness? Well, that applies not only to your everyday thoughts, but especially to your mindset during a conversation.If you're too busy worrying about everything you've said or will say, then you'll be less likely to pay attention or to make a meaningful contribution to the conversation. If you're distracted or nervous, other people will be able to tell.
If you notice yourself getting really distracted or worried about the conversation while you're having it, then count your in and out breaths to yourself until you've counted to 10 or 20 (without losing the thread of the conversation, of course!). This should make you more aware of the moment and less obsessed over the other details.

, If you want to make a habit of coming out of your shell, then it's not just about mastering your social game in the moment. It's about making a habit of hanging out with people, attending new events, and keeping your social life active. You may say no to things because you're afraid of social situations, don't want to feel awkward if you don't know enough people at the event, or because you'd just rather hang out by yourself than with other people. Well, the excuses stop today.


The next time someone asks you to do something, ask yourself if you're just saying no out of fear or laziness, and not for a legitimate reason. If it’s fear keeping you in, say “no” to the fear and go out!
You don't have to say yes to going to the ""bug lover's"" club of the random girl in your homeroom or to absolutely everything you're asked to do. Just make a goal of saying yes more often. You can do that.

, Part of coming out of your shell isn't just accepting to do what others want to do, but to start planning your own stuff, too. If you want to be known as a more social person, and one who is willing to put him or herself out there, then you should be the one to take the initiative some of the time. Even if you're just inviting people over to order pizza and watch Scandal, or asking a friend from class to go grab a cup of coffee, you'll be known as a person who has stuff going on.Sure, that 'ol fear of rejection may be creeping up again. People may say no, but that'll be because they're busy, most likely.
Plus, if you invite people to stuff, then they'll be more likely to invite you to do stuff.

, If you're an incredibly shy, introverted person, then yeah, it's unlikely that you'll be a big chatterbox after a month. Introverted people can't really become true extroverts, especially overnight, but they can certainly modify their behavior and attitude. Besides, you don't have to be a complete extrovert or to be the most outgoing person in the room to come out of your shell and emphasize your best qualities.That is, don't be frustrated if you can't get yourself to start dancing on tables and charming everyone in sight. You may not want that anyway.

, If you're the type who is a definite introvert, then you'll need time to recharge your batteries after a social interaction or just because. Classic extroverts gain their energy from other people, while introverts actually get drained from being around other people. And if your battery gets drained, then you need to refuel by giving yourself a few hours to be alone.


Though you may be set on making your social calendar more packed, always remember to plug in some ""me time,"" even if it feels inconvenient.

, Let's face it. At the end of the day, you may never be able to come out of your shell to a perfect stranger. However, as you get more comfortable with coming out of your shell, you can find the people who really get you and who really make you comfortable. Maybe it's just a group of your five close friends who really let you let loose, sing like an idiot, and dance to ""The Macarena."" But this core group can help you put yourself out there when it comes to the general public.


Finding your people will help you feel more comfortable with yourself, gain confidence, and to come out of your shell in the long run. What could be better than that?

, If you have trouble coming out of your shell, then it may be because you tend to leave the room whenever you get uncomfortable. If you find yourself in a social situation where you don't know many people, don't have much to contribute to a situation, or just feel out of your element, then you may tend to leave, make an excuse for going home early, or just quietly back away from the scene. Well, no more walking away when the going gets tough -- instead, revel in your discomfort and you'll see that it's not as bad as you think.


The more you make being out of your element a habit, the less you'll worry the next time it happens. Just take a deep breath, tell yourself it's not the end of the world, and find a way to make conversation -- or just to look like you're having a good time.

Acknowledge the problem.,
Make sure you say “I’m sorry.” Acknowledging that you were responsible is the most important part of the apology.,
Offer an explanation.,
Offer to fix the problem.,
Make sure it is appropriate.,
Act quickly.,
Find the appropriate medium for your apology.,
Move on after apologizing.",How to Apologize in Business," If you are apologizing, it is because you or your company may have done something wrong, failed to communicate properly, or simply be involved in a misunderstanding. Whatever the case may be, the first step is recognizing and stating there is a problem. Be clear and specific when talking about what went wrong. This lets the recipient (your boss, customers, coworker) know that you see the problem, and understand it., It seems simple enough, but your apology will go a long way if you actually say that you are sorry for what happened.Use “I” statements to get the apology across. “I’m sorry,” or “I deeply regret what I did.” This puts the focus on you, and what you did. Otherwise, it might sound as if you are blaming the other person.
Make sure to avoid the non-apology, or apologizing for how someone else feels. Avoid statements like “I’m sorry if what I did upset you” or “I’m sorry you took that the wrong way.” When you do that, you aren’t actually apologizing for your actions, just the result, which suggests you didn’t so anything wrong., Try to help the recipient understand how the mistake happened. Even if it was just an oversight or error on your part, identifying the cause of your mistake is a way to tell the other person that you know what happened and can avoid doing it again in the future.


One important part of this is to make sure the apology and explanation are separate from one another. While you want to make sure the recipient understands your intentions, the important thing is that you apologize first. Once that has been accepted, then you can move on to explaining yourself., If you are apologizing, then something has gone wrong. While your apology is a nice start, in order to maintain a good professional relationship it is important that you work with the recipient on finding a solution to the issue. The way you go about doing this depends on the nature of your mistake.


If you are a company apologizing to your customers, explain how you intend to resolve the problem. Make sure you include specifics related to the original problem. Avoid generic statements like “we are doing everything possible to prevent problems like this in the future” will come off as insincere without details.When dealing with customers, resolving the problem can mean giving the customer a discount on their next order if the mistake was a pricing error, or shipping the next order for free if it was a shipping or delivery mistake, or paying for damages that occurred as a result of mishandling. It is important to provide options like this as a way to keep customers.
If you are apologizing person-to-person, such as to a co-worker, you may consider asking for discussion and input on the way to resolve the issue. The recipient may not want to discuss it further, but you should give them the option. Offer by saying, “I am open to discussing what happened so we can work on avoiding this again in the future,” or something similar., Depending on the setting, an apology may be seen as an admission of guilt, especially if you are apologizing on behalf of your company to customers. If you or your company is not at fault for what happened, you do not need to issue an apology.Don’t take responsibility for things that are not your fault, and you will avoid over-apologizing, which can weaken your image with co-workers or customers. It is certainly appropriate to express empathy, but you should avoid taking responsibility. You can tell people “I’m disappointed to hear that,” and offer to help resolve the problem, but avoid saying “I’m sorry.”
If you are apologizing on behalf of a business to your customers, this may be seen as an admission of responsibility, and you may be held legally and financially liable. Make sure you discuss what happened with a lawyer to discuss any potential legal difficulties before apologizing. This isn’t effective for lots of the smaller mistakes that may happen with customers daily, so you may consider creating company policies for certain mistakes, and how your employees should handle them.

, If your customers are angry or upset with something your business has done, you need to move quickly. They are more likely to listen to an explanation if you issue it as soon as possible. The longer you delay saying anything, the more angry the future recipient will be.While there are times when you should delay apologizing in order to consult with other people, such as a lawyer, it is important that you get on that as quickly as possible so you can get your message out as soon as you can.

, Depending on the nature of your error, including what you did and who it was against, there are different mediums you can use to respond. If your mistake was one that affected all of your clients, an email is a good choice. If your error was posting an offensive or inappropriate message through social media, using that platform as a place to express your contrition.
If you need to apologize to someone in your own company, or to a specific client, try to arrange for a face-to-face meeting. If you can’t be in the same place, try video-conferencing, then a phone call. The closer you are able to get to the person you are apologizing to, the better. This will make you look more serious when offering your apology., Once you have apologized, and the apology has been accepted, you both need to be prepared to move past it. Hanging on to the issue will only make the situation more difficult to handle.This goes for recipients too. If someone apologizes to you, and you accept it, there is no need to dwell on the mistake any longer. Bringing it up again will look petty or unprofessional.

Slow down and control every movement.Practice controlled movements of all kinds whenever you have free time if you want to move like a ninja.,
Stick to the shadows when you’re on the move.As you move slowly and stealthily around, make every effort to stay silent and in the darkest shadows.,
Maintain slow, rhythmic breathing at all times.,
Use any unforeseen noises to your advantage.",How to Move Like a Ninja2," The idea in ninja training was to move so slowly and so quietly that your movements wouldn’t catch the enemy’s eye, even as you approached them.


If you see anyone while moving around, especially if they are facing in your direction, freeze in place immediately to consider your next move.
Silence and slow, controlled movements were at the heart of all ninja techniques and required a lot of patience and practice., Be mindful of light sources so you can navigate the shadows adequately.Ninjas almost always moved under the cover of night, but there were still other light sources to contend with, such as moonlight, enemy camp fires and so on.
You will have many other light sources to contend with in the modern world, so keep that in mind as you practice moving in shadows.

, Remember to breathe along with your movement. Unconsciously holding your breath can produce muscle tension, possibly resulting in a gasping release of breath if you are startled or accidentally unbalanced. Controlled breathing also keeps you calm and focused.


Practice rhythmic breathing with simple breathing exercises.
Consider practicing yoga, which emphasizes controlled breathing during movement.
Yoga will also make you more flexible and help you move more fluidly.

, Take advantage of any natural noise happening in your environment. Planning movements that may cause noise to coincide with the natural sounds.This way, any movement you make that makes a sound will be drowned out by the natural noise.


You can also create false sounds to distract the enemy or divert their attention.For instance, try throwing a rock in the opposite direction of where you’re hiding in the dark. It will make a sound, causing your enemy to look away from you and in the direction of the noise.
The ninja called this “Joei-on jutsu” – the art of concealing sound."

, Don't go right in with asking for Moderator/OP rank. Gradually tell the players and owner (if there) get to know you.

, Be the first to provide help to players in need and conform to the rules. Be nice, don't curse a lot, and help newcomers enjoy the server.


Be nice. Give people tips, post funny stuff and talk about a great part of the server.

, This will get you an answer of whether or not you should keep trying, and tell the owner/mods that you are interested in becoming one.


Just ask ""Hey do you guys need another staff member? I really care about this server and don't want to see it go on the wrong path.""

, Continue to provide help and tips to newcomers, as well as being nice. Don't just rage-quit the server because you aren't a mod/Op right away. Do not keep asking and asking if they need more every day, be calm, if they have a website or forum, keep an eye out for announcements.

, Wait until you have about three weeks' playtime under your belt before doing this. Make sure that the players and staff respect and know you. Just ask if any new spots have opened, and say that you would like to become one if they have. If there are no spots open, just tell the staff that they can always ask you when they are.

, The server may have a section on their website to apply for Mod or any Admin, if so, fill out the application form with detailed text and with good spelling and grammar. Do not keep asking when they will check the application, a lot of owners find this annoying and may even deny your application.

, Being a staff member on a server does not mean you can abuse your power, it means you have been assigned to help out the players and help the community. If you do not get promoted, keep trying and improving your knowledge on the server and when you are experienced, try again."

Look for the absence of menstruation.,
Start looking for other signs of pregnancy.,
Feel for any abdominal pain.,
Be aware of any vaginal bleeding.,
Consider whether any of the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy apply to you.,
Have your β-HCG levels checked in a blood test.,
Undergo a transvaginal ultrasound.,
Allow your doctor to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy.,
Seek treatment promptly.,
Take medication that will abort the pregnancy.,
Have surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy.",How to Detect an Ectopic Pregnancy," If you have missed a menstrual period, and had unprotected sex prior to that, take a pregnancy test.Although an ectopic pregnancy does not occur in the uterus, your body will present with many of the typical signs of pregnancy anyways.
If you have an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy test would hypothetically always be positive.However, remember that these tests do have the possibility of false positive results or false negative tests, so if in doubt it is always a good idea to visit your doctor for a blood test for a confirmation.;
, If you are pregnant, whether it has implanted in the uterus (as in normal pregnancy) or in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere (as in ectopic pregnancy), you will still likely experience some if not many of these common symptoms:breast tenderness
frequent urination
nausea, with or without vomitingabsence of menstruation (as previously mentioned)., If you have already confirmed your pregnancy or you still aren’t sure, but you experience abdominal pain, then it could be because of an ectopic pregnancy.The pain mainly occurs due to the pressure exerted by the growing fetus on the surrounding tissue, which in the case of an ectopic pregnancy does not have enough room to accommodate the fetus (the fallopian tubes for instance, the most common site of ectopic pregnancy, are not by any means designed to accommodate a growing baby).
The abdominal pain can be sharp and severe, or in some cases there may be no pain.
The pain often increases on movement and straining, and is often localized to one side of the abdomen.
Shoulder pain can also present due to the presence of blood in the abdomen, which can irritate the nerve that travels up to your shoulder.
Know, however, that round ligament pain is very common in pregnancy. This pain, similarly, is located on one side or the other (or both) and can come in intervals (which usually last a few seconds each). The main difference is that round ligament pain tends to occur in the second trimester.The pain from an ectopic pregnancy will usually emerge sooner than that.

, Light bleeding may occur due to irritation of the fallopian tubes as they are being stretched, and more profuse and severe bleeding may occur later as the baby grows to the point where the fallopian tubes may actually rupture. Bleeding during any sort of pregnancy is something that warrants examination from your doctor - particularly if it is continual or severe bleeding, in which case you are best to be seen in the emergency department sooner rather than later.Severe bleeding from ruptured fallopian tubes (which can occur as a result of an ectopic pregnancy) can lead to significant blood loss, fainting, and in very rare instances death if not treated promptly by a medical professional.Other serious symptoms (apart and aside from bleeding) which warrant prompt medical attention include severe abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, sudden paleness, or mental confusion, all of which could indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.Note that something called ""implantation bleeding"" is entirely normal. This occurs one week prior to your first missed menstrual period (3 weeks after your last menstrual period) and is a pinkish/brownish discharge that should fill more than a few pads.Bleeding from an ectopic pregnancy usually occurs later than this, after the embryo has implanted and begun to grow in a space that cannot accommodate very much growth.
However, if bleeding at any time is bright red in color, taking up several pads, and not improving within a day or so, it is important to seek prompt medical attention.

, If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above, you also need to consider if you fall into the high risk group of ectopic pregnancies. Certain factors increase a woman’s likelihood of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy.


Generally, women who have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past are more likely to experience such pregnancies in the future too.Other risk factors include: pelvic infections (sexually transmitted infections), multiple sexual partners (as this increases the chance of unknown STI's), fallopian tube tumors or abnormalities, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, having an IUD, endometriosis, or smoking.Also, if a woman has had ""sterilization"" (also known a ""tubal ligation"" surgery, when her ""tubes are tied"" in an effort to prevent future pregnancy), although this is normally very successful in preventing pregnancy if one were to become pregnant the risk of it being an ectopic pregnancy is notably higher., This is the first step towards the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.β-HCG is a hormone that is secreted by the developing embryo and placenta, so it rises as the pregnancy progresses and is a more definitive (and reliable) form of pregnancy test.
If the β-HCG level is above 1500 IU/L (often between 1500-2000 IU/L is suspicious), but no pregnancy is seen with ultrasound, doctors will worry about you having an ectopic pregnancy. This is because the β-HCG levels are normally higher in ectopic pregnancy than in normal intrauterine pregnancies, so it is certainly a cause for suspicion.If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected due to your β-HCG levels, your doctor will follow this up with a transvaginal ultrasound to see if she can visualize a pregnancy, and its location., These ultrasounds can detect 75-85% of ectopic pregnancies (the growing fetus will be able to be seen on ultrasound in that percentage of cases, which confirms its location).Note that a negative ultrasound does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. A positive ultrasound (one that confirms the presence of a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere outside the uterus), however, is enough to make the diagnosis.If the ultrasound is negative (i.e. inconclusive), but the β-HCG level is high and your symptoms are enough to concern your doctor that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor will likely recommend a ""diagnostic laparoscopy,"" which is a simple surgery with very small incisions where they can insert cameras into your abdomen to have a clearer look., If your blood tests and ultrasounds seem inconclusive, and an ectopic pregnancy is still suspected, your doctor may perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to visualize your pelvic and abdominal organs internally to look for the spot of implantation.This procedure usually lasts for 30 minutes to an hour.

, Once the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, your doctor will want to treat you very quickly. This is because the treatment for ectopic pregnancy is much simpler when done sooner rather than later. Also, it is impossible for an ectopic tubal pregnancy to ""survive""; in other words, the fetus won't be able to live anyway, so removing the pregnancy sooner rather than later prevents complications (which, if left too long, may become life-threatening)., The most commonly administer medication in this scenario is methotrexate. It is given via intramuscular injection, one or more times, depending upon how much is needed to successfully get rid of the ectopic pregnancy.After the injection of methotrexate is given, you will receive repeat blood tests to check your β-HCG level. If it drops to near zero (undetectable in the blood test), the treatment will be deemed successful; if not, you will receive more methotrexate injections until this goal is reached, and if it still not attained you may need surgery., During surgery, your doctors may also repair or remove the damaged fallopian tube if needed. Indications for surgery include:Severe blood loss requiring urgent treatment.
Failure of methotrexate treatment.

Keep tobacco products out of reach.,
Discard cigarette butts in the trash.,
Have a designated smoking room.,
Stop using tobacco products.",How to Handle Nicotine Poisoning in Cats3," Place e-cigarettes (and vials containing e-juice), nicotine gum and candy, transdermal patches, chewing tobacco and cigarette packs up high in a cabinet or on a high shelf. You can also keep your tobacco products in a locked drawer or cabinet.If you keep some of your products in a purse or backpack, then make sure to place your bag out of reach, or take them out of your bag and secure them when you get home.

, Do this once you are done smoking. Try to avoid leaving cigarette/cigar butts on the ground outside. Additionally, make sure to empty your ashtray in the garbage once you are done smoking, or place it up high and out of reach.If any e-juice has spilt on the floor or other surfaces that your cat can reach, make sure to clean the spills thoroughly. The spilt e-juice can get on their paws and they may lick it off.

, Make one of the rooms in your apartment or house a cat-free zone where you can enjoy your tobacco products in peace. This way you can control your cat’s exposure to tobacco products.

Whip up some simple syrup.,
Boil your cranberries.,
Cool and top your food of choice.",How to Make Glazed Cranberries2," In a medium saucepan, combine ½ cup (100 g) of sugar with a ⅓ cup (79 ml) of water. Set the pan on a burner and turn to the heat to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar.Usually simple syrup is equal parts sugar and water. Using less water here, however, will make your topping less runny.

, Once all of the sugar in your syrup has dissolved, turn the heat up to medium-high. Pour 2 cups (200 g) of cranberries into the syrup once it reaches a boil. Boil them for roughly five minutes, or until about half of them have burst open, then remove from heat.Once you remove them from heat, stir in ½ cup (160 g) of currant jelly.
Continue to stir until the jelly melts and combines with the syrup.

, Give your topping time to cool off until it reaches room temperature. This size batch should top a whole pie or cake with eight to ten servings. If this is what you are using it for, spoon it over the pie/cake and then place the whole thing in the refrigerator. Give the topping a half-hour or more to chill and set so it’s less runny.Alternately, you could also transfer it to a sealable container and use it for toast, muffins, cornbread, or whatever sounds tempting.

",How to Identify Kudzu," All 3 leaves will be attached to the stem on their own petiole, or stalk. The central leaf's petiole will be about 3/4 inch (19 mm) long, while the 2 outer leaves have much shorter petioles.;
, Generally, the central leaflet will have 3 lobes, or rounded projections. The outer 2 leaflets often have 2 lobes. However, kudzu's lobe structure can vary, with many leaves having no lobes at all. Leaves can grow quite large, often to about 5 or 6 inches (12 - 15 cm) long.

, Kudzu leaves have very small hairs, making them fuzzy to the touch.

, The key characteristic of kudzu vines is their tremendous growth rate; they can gain a foot (30 cm) of length per day in peak conditions. Kudzu can often be seen entirely covering tall trees, utility poles, or other structures. As they mature, vines may become thick and woody. Kudzu vines are capable of climbing nearly any type of support, and will also snake across the ground, rooting at each node.

, Kudzu produces flowers in late summer, usually in August or September in the southern United States. The flowers form a cluster (called a raceme) that can grow up to 8 inches (20 cm) high and emerge from the central petiole of a leaf arrangement.

, Kudzu produces small seed pods, usually about 2 inches (5 cm) in length. T

Look for a function in the form of y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}.,
Simplify by combining like terms.,
Determine the domain and range of the simplified function.,
Switch the roles of the x and y terms.,
Rewrite the inverted equation in terms of y.,
Determine the domain and range of the inverse function.,
Check that your inverse function works.",How to Find the Inverse of a Quadratic Function1," If you have the “right” kind of function to begin, you can find the inverse using some simple algebra. This form is something of a variation of y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}. Comparing this to a standard form quadratic function, y=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+bx+c}, you should notice that the central term, bx{\displaystyle bx}, is missing. Another way to say this is that the value of b is 0. If your function is in this form, finding the inverse is fairly easy.

Your beginning function does not have to look exactly like y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}. As long as you can look at it and see that the function consists only of x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} terms and constant numbers, you will be able to use this method.

For example, suppose you begin with the equation, 2y−6+x2=y+3x2−4{\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4}. A quick examination of this equation shows that there are no terms of x{\displaystyle x} to the first power. This equation is a candidate for this method to find an inverse function.
;
, The initial equation may have multiple terms in a combination of addition and subtraction. Your first step is to combine like terms to simplify the equation and rewrite it in the standard format of y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}.

Taking the sample equation, 2y−6+x2=y+3x2−4{\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4}, the y-terms can be consolidated on the left by subtracting a y from both sides. The other terms can be consolidated on the right by adding 6 to both sides and subtracting x^2 from both sides. The resulting equation will be y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}.


, Recall that the domain of a function consists of the possible values of x that can be applied to provide a real solution. The range of a function consists of the values of y that will result. To determine the domain of the function, look for values that create a mathematically impossible result. You will then report the domain as all other values of x. To find the range, consider the values of y at any boundary points and look at the behavior of the function.Consider the sample equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}. There is no limitation on allowable values of x for this equation. However, you should recognize that this is the equation of a parabola, centered at x=0, and a parabola is not a function because it does not consist of a one-to-one mapping of x and y values. To limit this equation and make it a function, for which we can find an inverse, we must define the domain as x≥0. 

The range is similarly limited. Notice that the first term, 2x2{\displaystyle 2x^{2}}, will always be positive or 0, for any value of x. When the equation then adds +2, the range will be any values y≥2.

Defining the domain and range at this early stage is necessary. You will use these definitions later in defining the domain and range of the inverse function. In fact, the domain of the original function will become the range of the inverse function, and the range of the original will become the domain of the inverse., Without changing the equation in any other way, you need to replace all appearance of y with an x, and all appearances of x with a y. This is the step that actually “inverts” the equation.Working with the sample equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}, this inversion step will result in the new equation of x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}.

An alternate format is to replace the y terms with x, but replace the x terms with either y−1{\displaystyle y^{-}1} or f(x)−1{\displaystyle f(x)^{-}1} to indicate the inverse function.


, Using a combination of algebraic steps, and taking care to perform the same operation evenly on both sides of the equation, you will need to isolate the y variable. For the working equation x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}, this revision will look like the following:x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}   (original starting point)


x−2=2y2{\displaystyle x-2=2y^{2}}    (subtract 2 from both sides)


x−22=y2{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{2}}=y^{2}}     (divide both sides by 2)

±x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}     (square root of both sides; remember that the square root results in both positive and negative possible answers)


, As you did at the beginning, examine the inverted equation to define its domain and range. With two possible solutions, you will select the one that has a domain and range that are inverses of the original domain and range.Examine the sample equation solution of ±x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}. Because the square root function is not defined for any negative values, the term x−22{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{2}}} must always be positive. Therefore, allowable values of x (the domain) must be x≥2. Using that as the domain, the resulting values of y (the range) are either all values y≥0, if you take the positive solution of the square root, or y≤0, if you select the negative solution of the square root. Recall that you originally defined the domain as x≥0, in order to be able to find the inverse function. Therefore, the correct solution for the inverse function is the positive option.

Compare the domain and range of the inverse to the domain and range of the original. Recall that for the original function, y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}, the domain was defined as all values of x≥0, and the range was defined as all values y≥2. For the inverse function, now, these values switch, and the domain is all values x≥2, and the range is all values of y≥0.


, To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.As a sample, select the value x=1 to place in the original equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}. This gives the result y=4. 

Next, place that value of 4 into the inverse function x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}. This does give the result of y=1. You can conclude that your inverse function is correct.

Create a learning plan.,
Give yourself goals to achieve.,
Experiment with different types of learning.",How to Set Aside Time for Learning Each Day2," The idea of filling learning time every day may be daunting. Instead of leaving it to chance, create a learning plan that lays out what you want to learn. Come up with a series of subjects, tasks, and activities you want to learn and plan out when you want to do which.This will help you be prepared for learning each day instead of wasting some of your learning time deciding what you want to do.
For example, you may choose a topic for each week. During week one, you may learn the capitals of Europe, during week two you may learn the capitals of Africa, then Asia, South America, and North America. You may choose a new inventor each week and read about their inventions and discoveries. You can choose a historical war and spend a week or two reading about the causes, battles, economic and social effects, and results.
You may decide to take a month and learn how to shoot a bow and arrow, crochet, play the piano, or cook a difficult recipe.
You may make each day a different type of learning. You may read on Mondays and Wednesdays, watch documentaries on Tuesdays and Thursdays, visit websites on Fridays and Saturdays, and choose any method you want on Sundays. If you are learning a skill, spend one day a week reading about the skill, then four days practicing, and one day trying something new you haven't before.

, When you start making time for learning, you don’t want to approach it without goals in mind. Goals will help motivate you to learn more and give you something to work towards. Once you’ve written your learning plan, put in goal markers along the way for each new subject, task, or activity you are learning.


For example, set the goal of two weeks to master a basic knitting pattern for a scarf.You may choose a month to learn as many world capitals or periodic table elements as possible, or learn a basic piano song in two months.

, Not every person learns in the same way. When you are figuring out what to learn, try different learning approaches to see what works best for you.You may like more visual learning through instructional videos, documentaries, or texts with more visual materials. You may be more of a tactile learner and need real examples of things as you learn about them, or a textual learner that needs to read instruction manuals or articles as you learn.


For example, you may watch a documentary from the History Channel about World War Two if you are a visual or auditory learner. For an auditory learner, you may listen to a podcast about whales, while visual learners may go to an interactive website with pictures and video footage of whales. If you are a hands on learner, you may need to practice the same song over and over until you learn it.
It will be a trial and error kind of process to begin with if you aren’t already familiar with how you learn.
Changing your learning environment while you learn can also lend to better learning each day.

Identify your reason for creating a scrapbook.,
Decide how you want to organize your scrapbook.,
Determine how you’d like to construct your scrapbook.,
Gather your pictures and put them in groups.",How to Start a Scrapbook1," Are there stacks of pictures in a drawer that you want to do something with? Does your iPhone currently have over a thousand pictures of your kids? Do you want to commemorate your wedding anniversary by displaying your favorite moments? Or would you simply like to take on a project to satisfy your inner-creative? Figure out why you want to start a scrapbook and what it will allow you to do.

, Once you’ve figured out why you want to start a scrapbook, you’ll need to figure out how best to present your idea. Your scrapbook can focus on a particular theme. It can attempt to tell a story.Or it can simply unfold a set of events in chronological order.


Let’s say you took your first trip to Europe, and returned with hundreds of photos. You could choose to create a scrapbook that highlights each city you visited. European cities would be your theme.
Maybe during your trip you got lost and met a group of locals who decided to show you the best places to visit in their city, including inviting you to an intimate gathering. You could craft your scrapbook around that impromptu adventure, which means your scrapbook would tell a story.
Or maybe you don’t want to leave anything out of your scrapbook about your trip. You could organize and display your photos in chronological order.

, You can create your scrapbook the old-fashioned way: by hand; or you could create it digitally using computer software. Figure out your preference by asking yourself a few questions:


Which method would be easiest for you?
Which method would you most enjoy?
Do you want to be able to hold your scrapbook in your hand once it’s finished?
Would you like to give your friends or family members their own copy of your scrapbook?
Do you want to avoid the mess that comes with making a scrapbook by hand? Or do you enjoy the physical act of making crafts?

, Pull together the pictures you plan to use in your scrapbook. If you’re creating a bound scrapbook, then have your pictures printed if they’re not already. Organize your pictures either by theme, chronological order, or based on the story you’d like to tell. If your photos are on a computer, you can easily organize them by moving them into separate folders. If your photos are on your smart phone, first transfer them to a computer, and then separate them into folders.

Use terracotta or sandstone diffusers.,
Buy an electric fan diffuser.,
Try a nebulizers or atomizers.",How to Diffuse Essential Oils2," These diffusers, which can be bought at many different department stores, are highly porous. They allow the essential oils to diffuse first into the stone and then into the air. These can be placed or hung wherever they can be most useful, such as high traffic areas or in a doorway. People walking by will cause waves of air to move by the diffusers. You can also place these diffusers in front of a fan.


Once the oil evaporates, you will have to refill it.
You can also buy necklaces specifically designed to do this as well, which are worn around the neck., Electric fan diffusers are available in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and styles. These typically come with pads that are used to soak up the oils. The oils can evaporate quickly on these, but the pads are changeable.


Avoid any diffuser that heats the oils unless there are settings on the diffuser that you can set to approximate body temperature., Nebulizers and atomizers are like humidifiers. They break up the oil into smaller droplets so they diffuse more easily. These usually contain two basic components, a base that contains the motor for the nebulizer and a glass or plastic bowl where the essential oil is placed.


Glass is preferable to plastic bowls because essential oils won’t stick to glass as much as they will to plastic. Be careful with the glass bowl, because they can be expensive to replace.
There are a number of companies and businesses, both online and in stores, that sell these types of diffusers. See which type seems best to you, and check to see if there are any reviews or customer comments to find the best ones."

Prepare yourself ahead of time.,
Accept that things change quickly.,
Think through how you deal with challenges.,
Work on your flexibility.,
Trust yourself.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Keep clear in your mind that you are responsible for your own life.,
Look for a silver lining.,

Believe and expect something better will come to you and have confidence in a future event.,

Hold on to your dreams.,
Keep trying until you break through the bad situations in life.",How to Cope With Anything," You don't know what bad things might befall you in the future, there is no crystal ball or certainty. However, you can plan and prepare yourself for the possibilities that happen in life, in a way that is sensible, measured and careful. There is no need to stock an entire garage with food supplies for the apocalypse but a decent shelf's worth of canned food for the next possible flood or earthquake displays common sense in knowing the lay of the land where you live, the potential problems that might arise, and so on.


Other things you could do is to pack a bag of supplies if you know you might be whisked off to hospital for a medical condition, put in smoke alarms to guard against a fire, write a will so that your family doesn't end up squabbling in the event of your death, block entry to rats so they don't end up chewing your cables, teach your kids street sense so they don't get run over, have a budget to prevent overspending, and so on.
These are sensible precautions, a form of readiness that you do have control over, so that when a difficult situation arises, you are at least somewhat prepared and have thought about what needs to be done next. If you are more interested in partying away and thinking someone else will mop up after the problem hits, then you are more likely to be unprepared and unable to cope. Everyone has a duty to think responsibly about the future.;
, That is part of what it means to be alive. One week you're employed, cuddling a spouse and chilling out on your porch; the next week you're unemployed, visiting your spouse in hospital and ringing repair workers for fixing the collapsed porch. You could excuse it by saying that ""things happen for a reason"" but really, things just happen and they need dealing with as best you can rather than bemoaning the fates of the world. Accepting that bad things will happen along with the benign and the good will give you a sense of proportion and readiness for what may come. Acceptance can also help to give you the strength to know that you can cope, do your best to pull through and recreate a new normal.

, Life can turn around suddenly and create major changes, so take some time to think about how you would work through a sudden change in events, emotionally and mentally, financially and physically. Think about past events you found challenging, difficult and terrible. What happened to you then? How did you respond or react to it? Did you fix things or did you wait for someone else to do that? This may depend on your age. If something bad happened in childhood, your parents probably fixed it, but you may have learned by observing what they did, as to what is worth repeating or not should it happen to you as an adult. Or, maybe you leaned too heavily on a spouse, a co-worker, a boss or someone else last time––what would you differently next time, if you had the opportunity to take the lead and fix things? Thinking through these scenarios and how you would respond next time helps you to build an internal memory base for better coping mechanisms next time, even if it's just a resolution to stay calmer.


Realize that drama changes nothing and heightens the fear. Running about screaming, wailing and crying about things going wrong may feel cathartic but when it is all that happens, it changes nothing. Being dramatic may attract attention initially but it quickly irritates the very people who could be of help to you, so it's not an answer to dealing with anything.
Look for patterns in bad situations. You may encounter something completely new that is bad and unfortunate but there are likely to be some familiar things that can help you to deal with any situation, drawing on how you dealt with a similar bad situation in the past.

, If you are someone who is wed to routine, accumulation and everything always staying the same, it is probable that a change in events will be much harder for you to cope with than a person who is far more flexible about routine and is less fussed about change. This doesn't mean that you have to change your whole personality; it simply means that learning to bend a little when there is change can serve you well, and can remove some of the fear associated with loss and change. Perhaps read books about change management and coping with change, to help you work on any issues related to change.


An inflexible person will often find difficult situations cause them to snap and break, because things aren't as they ""should be"". The world is indifferent to how you'd prefer life to be and while you can make the world suit you when the times are good, this attitude won't apply when things aren't going your way. It's at this point that embracing the change and being flexible about the possibilities can prevent such snapping and breaking. As the saying says, ""go with the flow"" and you might find things easier.

, First and foremost, trust that you will find a way to figure out any given situation, no matter how challenging it is already or will become. No matter how difficult that it may get, no matter how many things may go wrong, no matter who might leave you, no matter who turns on you and says that you are no good or whatever, know that you have the ability to turn it all around and survive. You will get through this, things will change but a renewed life is ahead of this hard time.

, This may sound laughable if you're tossing and turning every night with worry but it is important because the human mind doesn't think clearly when tired. Snatch naps here and there if a solid night's rest is eluding you; don't be ashamed to nap, as it's a safety valve, especially in times of deep stress.

, No matter how hard the situation is and how much others are pulling the strings, cutting off the finances, pushing you around, and so forth, you have the freedom within to protect yourself and to keep looking for the good in people who can help and who will not make things worse for you. Alice Hertz-Sommer, who was a survivor of a concentration camp during World War Two, said that: ""I look at the good. When you are relaxed, your body is always relaxed. When you are pessimistic, your body behaves in an unnatural way. It is up to us whether we look at the good or the bad. When you are nice to others, they are nice to you. When you give, you receive.""Find ways in which can you look for the good.

, It may be covered by the cloud but there is usually something for you to cling to, to learn from, to let go of. In time you will see something useful in the way of learning come out of this. It may not necessarily be good (although it could be) but it will inform you and give you the experience to know how to move forward and how to cope in the future. In some cases, it may instill you to make the most of life, in ways you'd never even considered before.

, Right now it may seem your life is the worst thing in the world but later down the road you may see the wisdom in what happened. Remind yourself that ranting, screaming and raging about it won't change anything but will upset you constantly, along with those around you. Take that anger, frustration and fear and try to do something positive about your situation instead.

, Then do something active to make it so, don't just sit there and hope affirmations will solve the matter. Fill out forms, call politicians, talk to the bank manager, sell your car and catch the bus, confer with the doctor, research possible cures, connect with neighbors, downsize, etc.––do whatever it takes to turn this bad situation into something tolerable, to take it toward an outcome over which you have at least some control because you made an effort, tried to do something positive. Realize that regaining control is a combination of faith, action and realism, and that each of these has a role to play together.

, They may well be experiencing the bad situation along with you, and each person will be coping in their own way, be it helpful or not. Recognize the pain and difficulties of others and support them; often this helps to put your own situation into perspective and will remind you that perhaps you're not the worst off after all. Moreover, helping others is a way of distancing yourself from the center of the action and is an ideal way of coping or at least giving yourself a break from constant self reflection as to what might happen to you or how this will impact your future. Reaching out to others can help to remind you that human beings are meant to connect together and support one another and that there are other people out there who care.

, Don't expect this to go on forever. Hard times come and go, just as the good times do. It feels terrible, deeply depressing and like wading through mud as it unfolds but if you can keep your head above that mud and your eye on the light in the distant tunnel, it will help you to keep moving toward the end point of this hard time, helping you to grow stronger with each passing moment.

, Take the actions necessary to make a promising future. Some ideas were discussed above, in relation to shoring up your hope with action. Other things you can do now include seeing a budget adviser, getting your own health seen to or the health of a loved one, searching for a job, investing in something for the future, preparing a will, stockpiling emergency gear, paying off a mortgage, changing jobs, and so on. Look at it from the point of view of what is not working right now, what brought you to this brick wall and tossed you over the boat, then work from those reasons to set in place approaches that will avoid the same circumstances from arising again in future. Lesson learned, now act on it.


If it concerns loss of a loved one, the lessons are likely to do with health and safety. Ensure that you and your family take good care of their health, notice early warning signs, drive more carefully, and so forth. If the loss has a genetic factor, you can get good gene testing to know what might be an issue and learn how to manage it within your family. It may also help to talk to a counselor to deal with the aftermath of the loss.
If it concerns loss of property, what can you do to better protect your home, shed, goods, etc. next time? Perhaps rebuild a fire-resistant house, lock your jewels in the bank or use this as an opportunity to own less things that drag you down.

, Maybe you wanted a successful marriage and your husband left you for another. This time decide that you will have a successful marriage with the right person. Mr. Wrong had to leave so Mr. Right could come in. Or, maybe you need to address unrealistic expectations of what marriage is before you feel ready to spend time with someone in such close proximity again. Don't rush ahead until you have worked out what didn't work out the first time.

, If you are the sort of person to have a big dream, don't let go of it. Instead, use the bad experience to inform you about what not to do and steer clear of the pitfalls. You might need to make adjustments to the extent of your dream, especially if it turned out to be unrealistic or unobtainable. Then, keep working on it until your dream arrives. 

, In the end what truly will matter is the love you shared, the people you stayed connected with and the good you tried to inject into the world, even in times of difficulties and even if it was for a short period of time. You will make a better life, just look hard for that glimmer of light and hope. Even though it may be dull, it is there, awaiting your ignition.

Teach your child to shop around.,
Encourage your child to be realistic when buying.,
Ask your teen to think about opportunity costs.,
Remind your teen to check their receipts.,
Discourage your child from providing extra information when making a purchase.,
Be a wise consumer yourself.",How to Help Your Teen Be a Wise Consumer1," For big-ticket items – snowboards, stereo systems, and musical instruments – your teen will be able to find similar or identical products at different price points. Tell your teen that it’s best to look around at several shops for more affordable items before settling on the one they want to purchase.Encourage your child to look up prices while on the go. For instance, if they find a great pair of jeans in one store, urge them to hop on their phone and look up the price of the same jeans at other retailers. If they locate the same item for a lower price elsewhere, suggest that they shop at the location with the lower price.
Show your teen online options for buying, too. Craigslist and eBay are great for finding rare and second-hand items.;
, The first questions your teen should ask when they make a purchase should be, “Do I really need this?” and “How often will I use this?” If they have any doubt that they will get substantial use and enjoyment out of whatever it is they’re considering buying – especially if it’s a big-ticket item – they should think twice before sinking their money into it. Other important questions your teen ought to ask include:Is this durable?
How long will this last?
Will this be a lot of trouble to take care of?

, Opportunity costs are the costs associated with not being able to buy or do something because you spent the money in some other fashion. For instance, if your teen wants to go to the theme park with his friends, but he can’t because he spent all his money on baseball cards, he has paid an opportunity cost. Help your child understand the dynamics of opportunity costs. Encourage them to save their money and spend wisely so they are not faced with a situation later where they can’t leverage their buying power., Consumers are often accidentally overcharged through system errors or mistakes made by checkout clerks. Sometimes items that were advertised as on sale really aren’t on sale, or are marked as on sale but haven’t had their prices adjusted in the retailer’s computer checkout system.Suggest to your teen that they can avoid a lot of hassle later if they ask pointed questions to clarify the price of a given product before checking out.
For instance, if your teen wants to buy a book that was found in the 50% off rack, but the book is not visibly marked as 50% off, instruct your teen to ask the checkout clerk, “Is this book 50% off?”
If the clerk answers in the negative, have your teen say, “I found it on the 50% off rack.”

, Many retailers collect additional information at checkout such as email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses. This information might be collected as part of a customer outreach or newsletter effort. Retailers might entice consumers to provide their personal info with promises of coupons. But this information might be sold to third parties who use it to send spam emails, unwanted phone offers, and junk mail. Plus, company databases are targets for hackers, and if successful, hackers could use your information to steal your identity.It can be hard to avoid providing information like home addresses if your teen buys online. Remind your teen to never save login information on their computer and change their passwords frequently.

, One of the best ways to you’re your teen become a wise consumer is to model the behavior for them. Children – including teens – continue to look to their parents for guidance. If you demonstrate intelligent buying habits, your teen will, too."

Consider what type of wheels you need.,
Know that durometer rating is a measure of a wheel's hardness.,
Know that the diameter of a wheel refers to its size.,
Use small, hard wheels if you are a street skater.,
Use mid-sized, hard wheels for skating vert.,
Use big, soft wheels if you skate mostly for transportation.,
Talk to your local skate shop staff if you still don't know what to buy.,
Remove the old wheels using a combination wrench.,
Remove the bearings by prying them out of the wheel.,
Return your bearings to the axle.,
Put on your new wheels.,
Tighten the nut on top of the new wheel.,
Recognize when you need new wheels.,
Read the box when buying wheels.,
Remember some skateboard vocabulary before shopping.",How to Choose Skateboard Wheels," This is dependent on the type of skateboarding that you do. There are different needs for street, sidewalk and skate park boarding, and you should try out a few wheels at your local skate shop to see what you like within those categories.


Think about where you skate, how often you skate, and if you prefer doing tricks or cruising around town.
Bigger or heavier riders usually prefer slightly bigger wheels.
While some skaters contend that different dyes change wheel properties, your color choice is almost completely cosmetic.;
, Today, all wheels are made from polyurethane, and higher a durometer number means that the wheel is made of a harder plastic. For example, a 95A wheel is much harder than an 80A one. Though rare, some companies produce ""B"" scale wheels. A B wheel is 20 points harder than it's ""A"" counterpart: thus an 80B wheel is as hard as a 100A wheel.
If you skate a bit of everything, consider getting a wheel around 90A-97A.
Soft wheels (75A-85A) absorb the impact of pebbles, sticks, and cracks for better cruising on roads.
Hard wheels (95A+) have more pop for jumps, grinds, and tricks.

, Always measured in millimeters, the diameter of a wheel is anywhere between 50mm for street boards to 75mm for longboards. Larger wheels cover more ground per rotation, and are thus faster. Small wheels sit lower to the ground are are less heavy.


Few companies list the width of a wheel, but in general wider wheels provide more balance, speed, and a smoother ride.
A good all-purpose wheel is anywhere from 52-60 mm.
Remember that the larger the wheel, the faster you'll go.

, For technical skating and tricks, you want responsive wheels that are easy to get off the ground. This prevents your wheels from catching on lips or grinds and makes it easy to perform ollies and flip-tricks.



Durometer -- 97A and above

Diameter-- 48-52mm
Note: Super small (48mm) and super hard (101A, 85B) wheels require good technique to handle, and are generally for experienced or professional riders.

, On ramps and half-pipes you'll want a lot of speed but don't have to worry about hitting sticks or pebbles. Harder wheels will give you good control for tricks and mobility.



Durometer -- 90A-97A

Diameter-- 55-60mm
Note: You can get bigger wheels to get more speed once you get comfortable.

, Bigger wheels are faster, and soft wheels absorb vibrations that make your ride uncomfortable or difficult. Most larger wheels are also wider as well, giving you increased stability.



Durometer--75A-85A, and 78A is generally considered standard.

Diameter-- 64-75mm , A good ""starter wheel"" is usually 52-55mm, 99A -- well balanced for most terrains. Most wheels today say what they are designed for on the package, so make sure you read the box. , Place the skateboard on it's side, then loosen the nut in the center of the wheel until it comes off.


Make sure your wrench fits snugly on the nut to avoid damaging it.

, Lodging a screwdriver or other long metal tool in the center of the bearing, slowly add downward force to the bearing until it slides out.


Depending on how old they are, the bearings may not come out immediately.
If your wheels have been spinning poorly or making noise, you may need new bearings.

, Slide the bearings back on the axle the way they came off. If they are dirty or sticky, use a rag to clean them off before moving on.

, Push them so that the bearings slides smoothly into the center of the wheel.

, You want to tighten the nut just enough so that the wheel has a little ""play,"" meaning it can wiggle back and forth a small amount. Tighten the rest of the nuts over you new wheels, and you're ready to start skating again.

, Skateboard wheels wear out differently depending on how often and where you ride them, but they generally need to be replaced every three to four months with regular use. If you do a lot of bumpy street riding or are a heavier rider you may need to replace your wheels more frequently. Some signs you need new wheels are:


Wheel diameter decreasing
Uneven or flat spots while riding
Slow or bumpy riding
Loose or noisy wheel bearings , Despite some confusing lingo and competing number systems, skateboard wheels are generally easy to pick out. Why? Because manufacturers have started developing wheels for various scenarios, and they almost always list their purpose on the side of the box. If you unsure, see if the box contains any ""suggested"" uses for the wheels before buying.

, Skateboard terminology, especially when it comes to building a board, can get complicated. To buy new wheels, however, you only need to know a few key words:



Bearings: These sit inside your wheels and allow it to spin around the axle. They are sold separately and you can reuse old bearings with new wheels.

Durometer: A rating system that determines a wheel's hardness.

Street Skating: a style of skateboarding that emphasizes tricks and short jumps in city environments.

Vert Skating: boarding in a specially designed skatepark with large ramps and half-pipes, and features for tricks.

Longboards: extra long, extra wide boards meant for commuting and going down hills.

Enjoy your date!",How to Talk to Girls Online," There are many websites and platforms to choose from that include ways to connect with girls. Consider online games, dating websites, or blog forums as possibilities when trying to find a girl with similar interests as you.;
, Wherever you choose to connect with someone, your online profile will be scrutinized. Be sure that you are presenting yourself in the best light by exhibiting the unique qualities that you would want others to perceive. When creating an online profile, be literate; bad grammar, bad spelling, and even text speak can be a huge turn-off to girls.


Remove any negative or disrespectful photos.
Delete posts that are disrespectful or inflammatory.
Post a profile picture that accurately represents your personality, Many people open conversations with “hey,” “hi,” “hello,” or “holla”, but these words are overused and not easily remembered. Using a unique greeting will ensure that you will be memorable to the girl you are talking to. Instead of the mundane greeting that won't make you stand out, try one of these openers:


“What's Up Wonderful""
“How are you today”
“Howdy”
“How’s it going”

, Now that you've started a dialogue, it's time to keep the conversation going. Avoid yes or no questions. Open ended questions specific to her, will encourage her to become engaged in the conversation. Find shared interests through online profiles and expand your conversation around common ground.


Ask “What types of outdoor activities do you enjoy?” instead of “Do you like sports?”
Build common ground with things like, “I got a dog in college, what animals are your favorites?

, Avoid seeming spammy by limiting your responses to one message for each one received. This is a way to encourage the conversation to move forward so that she wants to keep talking to you.

, Give her a compliment focused on part of the conversation or her personality. It is OK to have some fun with your conversation and show your sense of humor.


""Talking with you has been one of the best parts of my day.""
""Just when I thought everyone online was fake, I meet you.""
NOTE: Avoid complimenting physical appearances at this point. Phrases like “You’re hot” or “sexy” may seem like a good idea, but they give the impression that you are shallow and only care about looks. Use the information you have learned as the conversation develops to build the base of a fun relationship.

, Find common interests that you can relate to and share personal experiences. Do not dominate the conversation by making it about you, but keep her involved by showing you are interested in the same things she is.

, Express your happiness that you had the opportunity to talk with her. Let her know that you want to talk again by casually creating the opportunity to talk again. Try these lines and you can create an opening:


""This has been awesome. I hope we can talk again soon!""
""You mentioned (pick something from your conversation), I wanted to email you an article I found. What's your email address?""
""I gotta go, but I really want to hear more about _______, will you email me a link to your favorite site? My email is ______________.""

, Open up deeper conversations through email. You can create a stronger relationship by sharing personal stories or events from your life. Make a connection last by showing her who you are and being honest about your past., Keep her thinking about you by keeping up with what she's doing on social media and engage in conversations through comments and likes.

, Remember that she has a life too, and don't expect an instant reply to every email. It may take her a few days to respond to your emails, so be patient and let her respond before you send multiple emails. , Once you have exchanged four or five emails, it's time to bring the relationship into the real world. Ask her what her schedule is for the next week and pick a day that she's free. Tell her the time and place you'd like to meet, and be confident. She'll appreciate that you are able to make decisions.

, You put in a lot of work to get to this point in a relationship that started online. Be yourself and remember her interests from your early conversations to keep the date from going stale.


NOTE: Be sure you tell family and friends where you're going and when to expect you back just to be safe!

Learn the language.,
Have all of your sailor's email addresses.,
Be flexible.,
Be patient.,
Be understanding.,
Write often, if your sailor is deployed or in a different part of the country or world than you are.,
With all this in mind, proceed how you would normally date someone.

",How to Date a US Navy Sailor," The military has its very own version of the English language, and the Navy is no exception. Your sailor will throw around somewhat incomprehensible jargon because he or she is used to everybody understanding what they are talking about. This is simple to fix - if you don't know or aren't sure what your sailor is talking about, ask.;
, Most sailors have two email addresses - a navy one and a civilian one. The navy email address is typically used for work, but many commands do not allow personnel to check their civilian email accounts on government computers for security reasons. And oftentimes, your sailor may not be reachable by phone for a variety of reasons (i.e. no reception, cell phones not allowed in certain buildings, etc) and it is oftentimes easier to reach him or her by email. This is especially true of ships. Cell phone reception inside a ship is almost non-existent. When these ships get underway, the sailors on-board are completely unreachable by cell phone and have no access to civilian email accounts.

, Your sailor's work schedule will change at random, and often at short notice. On this note, try not to plan any surprise vacations. His or her command probably has a radius of several miles (i.e 300 miles) that they aren't allowed to go outside of without an approved leave chit. It would be a shame to spend time and money planning a trip only to find out that your other person can't go. Another thing your sailor will have to do is stand duty every so many days. This varies from command to command, and sea duty to shore duty. Usually, ship duty sections stand duty for 24 hours, and aren't allowed to leave the ship. Standing duty at a shore command is more relaxed. If you don't know what your sailor is talking about, just ask.

, There's a saying in the Navy, ""Hurry up and wait."" What that means is it often takes a long time to get anything done, much to the chagrin of your sailor. With schedules described in the above step, sailors often like to take leave, the military version of vacation days. Sailors get 30 leave days a year and emergency leave is deducted from that total if it is used (there is no ""sick leave,"" ill sailors are either hospitalized, put in bed rest or re-assigned to a duty they are able to perform.) Sailors are, however, allowed to go ""in the hole,"" and have a negative leave balance in some situations and they will earn their leave back. The sailors also have to route a special chit requesting how many to use and when, and get it approved. In fewer words, they have to get permission first. This takes as little as four business days, but up to a couple of weeks or more. Another thing you will have to be patient with, is mail. Sending mail to their command, especially if it's a ship, usually takes much longer than mail sent to a 'normal' address. Send something to a ship deployed overseas, and it will likely reach its destination in a few months, or more. A Christmas card showing up in March is not uncommon. Keep that in mind when sending off a care package to your said sailor.

, Your sailor may not be able to talk about everything, or anything, pertaining to his or her job, or even schedule, for security reasons.

, Or if you feel like. You may not hear back from your sailor everyday, or even every week, but emails from home are always welcomed.

First, read and familiarize yourself with the rules.,
In accordance with the rules, pick your empire.,
Place your Capital/Castle in a defensible position.,
Stake out your territory.,
Reinforcement phase: If you placed an army in someone else's territory, follow through and defend it to withstand the first turn.,
Now, as the game starts, carefully observe what goes on before your turn if you are not going first.,
Essentially repeat the past step as the rounds shift-Remember, even if you're last, you still have someone playing the turn after you.

,
Push, push, push-be aggressive!,
When ready and have a sufficient army (the size will depend on your target) aim for a Breakthrough or Blitz strategy.,
After the elimination of some players, Castle Risk may evolve into a two or three sided arms race.",How to Effectively Play Castle Risk,";
, If you and your friends are OK with it, you can each choose your own Empires. Different Empires: Empires have their advantages and disadvantages.


French Empire: Often seen as the best empire, France has easy access to an unoccupied Britain, and superior access to Spain. It is also somewhat defensible
British Empire: Held in high regard by the author, Britain is a highly defensible empire, with only two points of land entrance.
Russian Empire: Russia is disadvantaged in that it borders two empires-but if they are not occupied, then they can easily be taken
Ottoman Empire: This is a somewhat defensible empire, with a prime spot for a capital on a bottleneck.
Austrian Empire: Definitely the least defensible of the empires, Austria should be avoided on the basis that it is likely to be completely surrounded by enemies and a limited coastline.
German Empire: Faced with the same problems as the Austrian Empire, Germany is unlikely to be a long-lasting empire.

, A Coastline is an excellent place to place it. You will likely have many troops in your Capital, so you will be able to use the Admiral card to attack from here to a distant territory effectively.

, Do your best to fill in your empire, as it will grant you a bonus. Do not be afraid to place an army in someone else's territory to augment their bonus. If they are placing outside their territory, you may finish filling in your territory before they do. Look for those people. DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS TO MORE THAN ONE PERSON. Don't be surprised if someone does this to you. When the reinforcement phase comes, you can reinforce to repel them.

, Just a few armies can intimidate them into turning their reinforcements elsewhere or send them into a paranoid defense, leaving them out of the aggressive picture.


If you fell victim to this, make sure you have the forces to repel and conquer this territory. You will get a bonus for holding the territory, and the territory can serve as a foothold for an invasion.

, Watch for an exposed area. If a country is guarded with only one army feel free to devote an army or two to its capture. Don't devote more forces than absolutely necessary unless you plan to follow through and Blitz (see below) their territory.


If you are not able to reach an exposed position, alert someone who would be inclined to form a truce or alliance with you. They will more than likely take up the chance.

,, if you can force your enemy's borders to their capital, you're in great shape. Don't overexpose yourself.

, You will either want to go straight for the eye, or Capital, or seek to deprive your enemy of their valuable territories-if doing the latter, don't overexpose yourself, i.e. surrounding their capital with one army territories, and the help of an ally is appreciated. If going for the capital, make sure you have a massive army-remember, the capitol gets a defense bonus.

, At this point, look for openings in defenses-overpower them and push to the capital, or deprive them of land like in the last step-you can trust allies at this point.
