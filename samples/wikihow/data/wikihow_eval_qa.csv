[],What can I do to control my anger and react maturely?,"If you find yourself angry at a person, it is generally helpful to leave the room until you have calmed down and think about why you're angry. Once calm, ask for clarification to see if you might have misunderstood what was said to or about you. Following this, express your feelings gently to the person who made you angry, even if you are afraid of how they will react.",How to Have Anger and Be Christian,";
, If angry at a person, it generally helps to leave the room until you have calmed down. Don’t say something you will regret later: think about “I've hardly ever regretted anything that I didn’t say.""



Think about why you are angry. Are you misinterpreting the situation?

Ask for clarification after you have calmed down. See whether you misunderstood what was said to or about you.

, Ask God to help you with your anger.

, It doesn’t possess us, but it can oppress us and kind of control us at different times.


You can say boldly, “In the name of Jesus, spirit of anger I command you to leave. You are not welcome here.”
Or another good phrase to say aloud is, “By the power and blood of Jesus, 'Satan be gone!' ”
It may then feel like something that is controlling your mind and emotions left. There are demons or even bad attitudes that can control us in certain ways, if we let them.

, So always be very careful when angry. Anger can ""open a window"" to Satan in your mind and heart.

, Don’t just stuff your anger.


“Don’t let the sun go down on your anger"" means that you need to address what you are angry about.

, Jesus said, ""Love one another.' Love covers a multitude of sins (by forgiving).


Don’t just ""not speak"" the truth, even if you are afraid of how the person will react.
Tell the person who made you angry how you are feeling, but do it gently.
Even if the person doesn’t say ""I'm sorry"", forgive anyway. Why? Because God commands you to and also because holding onto bitterness won’t help you at all.

, Headaches are a well known physical result of anger and worry. Emotions affect the physical body; so if only for the sake of your own health, let go of your anger. Forgive whatever happened, and move on.

,


An example would be, someone cutting you off on the road.
You might also want to get angry at mistakes you make, like losing your phone, etc. But try not to. That will raise your blood pressure, your stress levels and cause you to not live as long.

,,


A lot of stress we bring on ourselves; we can cause much of our own stress.
Always remember, “It’s not about what happens to you that matters, but how you respond to it.”
We can control our own responses to things. If we determine in our minds that we will stay calm no matter what, then we can. Ask God for help to stay at peace, and He will help you.

There is a book by Cloud and Townsend titled Boundaries that may help you a lot.
Often times people get angry when they feel like a line has been crossed in some way. But, if other people never know what those lines are, how can you justify getting angry about it -- right? So you need to express to people what your lines or boundaries are.

,


Maybe you get mad easily, if someone is late, or if things are messy. Present your desires to people. Explain what areas you are more sensitive in or have more needs in. There may or may not be compliance with what you want. If not, then accept it and move on. But at least you will know that you tried to express yourself and what you wanted.
Often times anger builds up when we don’t express ourselves. We may feel stuck or trapped for some reason. Communicating about things will help bring freedom in any area. Anger or hurt may come when we feel ignored or disrespected.
Build more of a relationship through talking, showing interest and kindness; so you won’t feel ignored. Don’t expect people to read your mind or intuitively know what you need at any time; you have to tell them your ideas and needs. Listening and communicating is always very key to setting justifiable boundaries.

, Unresolved anger is not conducive to humility.


Often anger comes from one's own ego and pride, as when not getting ones own way and becoming angry. But remember, it’s not all about you, as there are six billion other people on the planet that have their own wants and needs too.
If what you want conflicts with what others want, sometimes you will have to let them have what they want.

, Everyone is not here to meet ones needs alone. Each person needs to take care of oneself, if competent.


Sometimes the angry person is on an ego trip. That is when a person shows/demands that everyone must cater to that person's desires by doing things his or her way.

, But, that may be for others or God to decide. No one but God is always right. No one can manage the universe, or be perfectly good.


Paul says in Romans 12, “Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.” Often times anger comes when we have a high opinion of ourselves and the way we think things SHOULD be done. But no one is perfect. None of us has a perfect way of doing things.
There is a need to allow for differences in other people and different opinions on things. It is never one person is right and everyone else is wrong. Admit that sometimes you might be wrong too.
Always remember to stay humble and not think of yourself as perfect or better than you are. If you are able to see that you too make mistakes all the time, then you will have more grace for other people, and you will then become angry less often. Amen.

,


Jesus was angry many times, and yet he was without sin.
Getting angry is not the sin; how you handle your anger is what can become a sin. Gossiping about people is a passive aggressive way to act out your anger. It’s better to confront the person directly. When Jesus was angry at the Pharisees, he didn’t gossip about them with his disciples: He confronted them directly.

, Don’t explode, but don’t implode (cave-in) either.


Don’t stuff it and hold it in, because that does just as much damage to a relationship as exploding on someone. Both can limit the freedom in a relationship.
If someone shuts down or gets overly angry with you, you won’t feel as free to talk and be with him or her. Be open but gentle about your anger, by always “speaking the truth in love.”

,


Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” #*Likewise the apostle Paul said, “As far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men.” Paul also said, “Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life.” Those are some great verses regarding keeping the peace.
Another great verse is, “Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” Amen.

[],What is the purpose of the back light in photography?,The back light's role is to provide a glowing rim of light around your subject that separates it from the background. It is usually positioned directly behind the subject.,How to Use Three Point Lighting3," The back light's role is to provide a glowing rim of light around your subject that will separate it from the background. For this reason, the back light should generally be positioned directly behind your subject. The best way to keep the lamp out of your camera's shot is to suspend it above your subject and aim it downwards.

, If your subject is very light-colored (for instance, a fair-skinned person in white clothing), you will need very little intensity to your back light. A dark-colored subject will need a much more powerful back light to provide separation against the background, especially if the background is also dark.

, Just as you can use the sun as a key light, you can employ it as a back light. Position the shot so that the subject's back is to the sun. You can even use a bright aluminum reflector as a key light and a piece of white foam board as a fill light. This type of setup requires no electric light at all!

"
[],How can one determine the intensity needed for the back light and what natural alternatives can be utilized?,"The intensity of the back light depends on the color of the subject; a light-colored subject needs very little intensity while a dark-colored subject requires a much more powerful back light.

[],What are the recommended steps for removing an old countertop?,"Start with disconnecting the plumbing to prevent any water leakage. Follow this by loosening the sink and other plumbing attachments, and then removing them. Then, cut the caulk around the backsplash using a utility knife and pry away the backsplash using a putty knife and a crowbar. Lastly, unscrew your countertop from the top, sides or underneath and pry it away from the cabinetry ideally with several people to help handle the weight.",How to Make a DIY Countertop," Work slowly and carefully to ensure that you do not wreck the cabinetry. The following are essential steps in effectively removing an old countertop:


Disconnect your plumbing. If your countertop is located in a kitchen, bathroom or utility area, you must ensure that you cannot have water leakage. Stop the water from its source.
Loosen the sink and other plumbing. You can use a putty knife and the help of a few friends. Remove these items when they are loosened.
Cut the caulk around the backsplash, if you have it. Use a utility knife to cleanly cut and strip away the caulk holding the backsplash in place. Place a putty knife next to the wall and use a crowbar to pry away the backsplash until it is removed.
Unscrew your countertop from the top, sides or underneath. Again, use a putty knife and crowbar (if necessary) to pry the countertop from the cabinetry. It is a good idea to have a number of people helping you so that you can do it gently and pull it away without dropping the counter or digging into the cabinets.;
, It will be far easier to take the dimensions once it is no longer connected to the cabinets. Take measurements of the width, length and depth before going to the hardware store.

, There are quite a few inexpensive options, but what makes sense for your home may be determined by the availability in your area.


Find reclaimed wood from a construction site or a construction recycling business. An old door will work as well. Find a piece of wood that is larger than your measurements, so that you can cut it down to size. You can also use several pieces and glue them together, as long as they are the same depth. Remember, if there are some imperfections, these can add to the charm of the wood, or it can be re-sanded in the refinishing process.
Find tongue and groove flooring from your local home improvement store. Many of these stores have sales every few months on wood that is overstocked. Buying enough tongue and groove flooring for a counter will be fairly inexpensive. If you choose to do this option, have the clerk calculate how much you will need based on your measurements. Also, you may want to leave your existing countertop in place and glue over the top, or install MDF or a thick plywood countertop in exact measurements before you use the flooring.
Order a piece of wood board from a hardware store. You can have a piece of wood in any type cut to the size you need at most home improvement stores. You will have the most control over what type of wood you want with this option, but it is likely to be more expensive if you choose a rare wood.
Choose a hard wood for this project. Soft wood will mark easily and be less durable over time. Ash, hard maple, cherry, mahogany, oak, walnut and teak are all hardwoods. Oak is the most common material for making furniture. Pine is a soft wood that is commonly used with furniture, but you may want to choose yellow pine over white pine if you are opting to use a softer wood.

, Cut it to size with a circular saw, if this has not already been done at the home improvement store. If you are using tongue and groove flooring, you will need to cut the boards to desired lengths, taking into account how they fit together.


With flooring, 1 of your boards may need to be cut lengthwise in order to achieve your desired counter width. You may choose to use this board at the back of the counter to hide the unfinished cut.

, Finish it with fine-grit sandpaper. This is also not necessary with the tongue and groove option.

, Liquid nails will work well for tongue and groove flooring and gluing together separate pieces of panel. It is important to glue the separate pieces of wood together, rather than gluing the board directly to the cabinets.

, Wipe away excess glue throughout the process with a clean cloth.

, Place heavy objects on top of the wood so that they do not bow while drying. Allow them to dry according to glue bottle directions.


Try to space your clamps out evenly. This will create an even hold in all areas.

, These small nails are usually applied with a hammer, but a nail gun can be used for larger projects. Make sure to space them at regular intervals, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.3 to 0.6cm) from the edge of the counter.

, This will also help to affix the stain. Wipe the surface with a tack cloth before staining.

, This is a water-based product sometimes called ""conditioner."" You will want to take extra time when finishing the countertop to ensure it is ready for use.

, You can apply it with a foam brush or a cloth. Repeat another coat once dry to achieve a darker color.

, Use between 2 and 5 coats, allowing it to dry according to the package directions.

[],What steps can be taken to transform an individual's learning experience into a broader organizational lesson?,"There are several methods for making an individual's learning experience an organizational lesson. One method is debriefing with oneself, where the person in question reviews the experience and asks reflective questions. The individual should then share this knowledge with a suitable group within the organization who can expound on its importance. This narration should aim to stimulate responses regarding the event's relevance to the organization. The learning experience can also be shared with clients and peers for additional perspectives and problem-solving. Lastly, maintaining records of these sessions helps preserve these lessons for future reference and further learning.",How to Debrief to Promote Organizational Learning," Alone, each of these methods has singular utility but they are most successful when combined as an overall strategy for turning an employee's learning experience into an organizational lesson. These methods are:


Debriefing with oneself
Debriefing with a team
Debriefing with a client
Debriefing with peers;
, Before taking your learning experience to a wider audience, it is important to go through your experience with yourself. This type of debriefing consists of asking yourself questions about the learning experience and keeping notes. In this way, you not only prepare yourself for sharing the experience more widely, but you also learn about the experience at a deeper level for yourself and hopefully also take this chance to reflect on how you might approach things differently next time if the learning experience was more of a negative one. Questions that you might ask yourself include:


What did I learn?
What lessons can I extrapolate from this experience to bring to the organization?
What was good about this learning experience?
What was bad about this learning experience?
How can I build on both the negative and positive aspects of this experience?

, Select the appropriate organizational team people who will benefit from your learning experience and who can expand upon its import for the rest of the organization. Initially, tell the team about the experience and about what you learned. However, this time you should also aim to elicit team responses to how they perceive the learning event and how they see its applicability to the organization. The team should be made up of individuals who are able to address issues that have been raised and come up with solutions, actions and outcomes.

, In a situation involving a client, the ability to ask the client about the experience is invaluable. This time, frame the questions using ""we"" and genuinely seek answers from the client that can help to improve both the client's experience and the working patterns and deliverables of your organization. This is not meant to be a confrontational exercise but is a genuine attempt to come to grips with areas of weakness in your organization and they may well be areas that nobody has considered before or has only danced around. Finally, clients appreciate being asked, so this does a great deal for building a strong relationship. Questions that you might consider asking the client include:


Did we do a good job for you this time?
If not, why not and how do you feel we could have made this a better experience for you?
Are there particular areas that you feel need greater attention?
What did you like about your experience with us?
Is there any particular activity or event that you believe is superfluous to the achievement of a good outcome?

, Peers in your profession are also benchmarkers and innovators. They are watching you and you are watching them. Touch base through networks and exchange ideas and thoughts over recent learning experiences in a broad manner that does not breach client or organizational confidentiality. You can, and should, share experiences with peers. Some may have answers to problems that you are facing, some may appreciate your answers to problems that they are facing. Developing strong relationships even within a competitive context is vital to ensuring that all clients are receiving the best advice, skills and up-to-date information, so it pays back for all of you. Questions that you might consider asking include:


Why did you resolve X problem in that way?
What additional benefits did you foresee doing it like that as opposed to the way Y?
What recommendations would you make to someone doing this same thing?
What do you think the outcome would have been if you had done Y?
What thoughts do you have about developing Z instead?

, Unless you debrief for personal reasons, it is always a good reason to keep file or notebook records of debriefing sessions. That way you, your team and your organization can continue to learn from past lessons and the discussions surrounding these experiences. It will also help you to better recall what each of your clients expects of you in the future and gives you a good indication of how your client's organization operates and the types of expectations under which that organization may be working.

, Don't just stick the notes in the bottom drawer. Pursue the lesson actively and put into practice what you have learned. If you, your team or your organization generally needs extra skills or a change in direction, start implementing the things that need to be done to achieve this. Book yourself into a conflict management course, book team members into an updating seminar on the industry in which you work or make proposals for changes in direction about the ways that things are done, produced, manufactured and delivered within your organization. Use every debriefing session to build upon the last, to continuously strive for improvement from the individual level to the wider organizational community.

"
[],How can I use debriefing sessions to foster a continual improvement environment in my organization?,"Debriefing sessions can be used as a tool for continual improvement by actively executing what was learned. If skills need to be grown or a change in direction is necessary, these insights can be used to instigate the required actions or trainings. Attend conflict management courses, industry seminars, or propose changes within your organization.

[],What are some activities that can potentially help labor progress?,"Activities such as walking and moving can help labor progress. Walking can help stimulate the release of oxytocin through the swaying rhythm, and moving helps you cope with the pain of labor while wiggling the baby towards your pelvis. Sex may also help as it can stimulate your body to release prostaglandins and oxytocin.",How to Help Labor Progress2," Even though activities such as having sex or trying an herbal supplement may seem harmless, in some cases they could cause harm to you or your baby. Before trying any natural option to help labor progress, ask your doctor or midwife. She will help you decide whether there are safe, effective options for you.


If you ever have questions, or even just feel frustrated about your pregnancy seeming to take so long, talk to your doctor or midwife. These professionals are used to the concerns and questions pregnant women have and are happy to talk with you about them.

, Walking is one of the most popular activities to help labor progress and to start labor. Gravity is the main reason walking works. The baby is drawn down towards your pelvis and this primes your cervix for labor. The swaying rhythm of walking pushes your baby's head against your cervix, simulating the release of oxytocin. This hormone can trigger contractions.Walking can also help build muscle and increase physical fitness, making labor faster and less painful.Slow, gentle walking is ideal. Do not go too far or push yourself too hard physically in the late stages of labor. An easy stroll around the block is probably adequate., Sex can be difficult in the late, late stages of pregnancy, particularly if labor has already begun. However, certain hormones released during sexual activity may speed up labor, although little evidence to support this exists.Because certain pregnancy complications can make nipple stimulation or sex unsafe for your baby, you should always discuss this option with your doctor or midwife before trying it.


Penetration can stimulate your body to release prostaglandins, a hormone that helps dilate the cervix, prepping your body for delivery. Stimulation of the breasts and nipples or orgasm can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which may trigger contractions.Remember, sex is only safe if your water has not broken yet. Once your water breaks, sex could lead to an infection that could complicate labor and delivery., Oftentimes, if your labor has been latent for a long time, walking, moving, or even switching the position you're lying in can help get things moving again.


Moving is a great way to help you cope with the pain of labor. Walking, shifting in bed, and standing up keep your body rested and refreshed and help save energy for the final pushes.Movement also wiggles the baby around, helping it move towards your pelvis and ultimately push through your birth canal., If you're giving birth at home or haven't left for the hospital yet, a warm bath may help you feel more comfortable. However, there is no evidence that a warm bath will help labor progress.Make sure the water completely covers your stomach and breasts as this will provide the most pain relief.Contractions are less painful for many women in water and often the soothing sensation of being in a tub helps women relax and rest in between contractions.Water also makes it makes it easier for you to move around and change positions. As stated, movement during labor helps it progress., The muscles surrounding your uterus need a lot of hydration and nutrition to successfully deliver an infant. Eating well in the weeks leading up to labor, and in its early stages, can help labor progress quickly.


Many doctors do not recommend eating during labor due to the risks associated with food being in the digestive track if emergency anesthesia is needed. Ask your doctor about their policies beforehand and, if eating is not allowed, have a light snack before leaving for the hospital.You may also find that a clear liquid diet, involving a warm broth or jello, is helpful. Most hospitals will allow laboring patients to consume clear liquids.
Labor is shorter when you snack during the process. Women allowed to eat during labor had labor times of 45 to 90 minutes less of those who did not. Laboring is difficult and requires fuel in the form of foods and liquids especially during the final pushes.Stick to bland but filling foods, like toasts with jam, plain pasta, applesauce, and jell-o. As for liquids, go for clear broth, water, and ice chips. These foods are easy to digest and tend not to increase nausea or stomach discomfort., Several ""natural"" ways to induce labor circulate on the internet, but none of them have significant research backing, and some can be actively harmful. It is best to avoid these and consult with your doctor or midwife about proven, safe, and effective ways to speed up labor.Castor oil. Castor oil is one of the oldest recommendations when it comes to starting labor naturally, but there is no evidence that it works, and it can make you very sick. The American Association of Family Physicians does not recommend that you use castor oil to induce labor.Herbal supplements. These commonly include evening primrose oil, black or blue cohosh, red raspberry leaves, and black haw. They do not have much evidence to support their use, and herbal remedies may interfere with other medical conditions or medications you're taking.Acupuncture.

[],What is the best way to house a wild bird that I am caring for temporarily?,The best way to house a wild bird is in a ventilated box lined with towels. This provides a sense of protection for the bird and the darkness helps keep them calm. Don't forget to make air holes in the box.,How to Take Care of a Wild Bird3," Wild birds are not domesticated like house birds. A cage may alarm them, and they can injure themselves in an attempt to escape. Ventilated boxes lined with towels are actually best for birds, especially adult birds who have lived in the wild their whole lives. The dark calms them, and the enclosed space gives them a sense of protection against predators.Make sure you poke air holes in the box.


Remember this will only a temporary solution for keeping birds. The end goal to caring for wild birds is to reintroduce them into the wild, not to keep them as pets.

, Birds will be quiet as they recover so do not be alarmed if they do not sing or chirp in the box. In fact, the quieter their shelter, the better it will be for their healing.If the bird is an adult, you should keep the box outside as far away from the house as possible.
Baby birds should be kept close to you for constant supervision. You may choose to keep them inside or outside. If you do choose to leave their shelter outside, make sure that they remain close to the house, and give them an insulated shelter for warmth and protection.

, Especially if the bird you have rescued is a baby, you will want to keep the bird warm. There are a few methods you can use to warm a bird bed. If the bird is an adult, it may only need towels and grass shavings for warmth. If the bird is an unfeathered chick, it will need a more substantial source of warmth.You can pour warm water in a bottle and wrap it in paper towels. You may also want to put paper towels around the bird so that this doesn't burn them. This is a good option if you are keeping the bird outside.
Alternatively, you may make a bed of towels or old t-shirts in a pet carrier. Place the bird inside. Leave a heating pad beneath the carrier on throughout the day and night. The heating pad should warm the entire carrier.This is ideal if you are keeping the bird inside.

, If it curls up and isn't moving, it's not dead! It's sleeping, and this bird needs to sleep. It will tell you when it's awake and hungry again. Make sure you stay nearby when they're sleeping; they will need your absolute attention when they wake up.

, After a few weeks, you will notice the bird has sprouted more feathers. The bird will also start flapping its wings and shuffling around on its own. It is becoming a fledgling. It is extremely important in this stage that the bird has room to move around as it will be learning to fly. Supervise the bird carefully but give him room to move.


To ensure successful reintroduction into wild, take the chick outside once or twice a day. Hold the nestling in your hands, and if they try to fly off, don’t stop them. This exercise will strengthen their muscles and help them learn to fly. As time goes by, they will fly away for farther distances and longer periods of time but may still return for feedings.To prevent injury inside the home, you can teach the fledgling to avoid mirrors and windows. Hold the bird up to the glass and allow them to poke their beak against it. Do this repeatedly to teach the bird to avoid these as they learn to fly."

As you begin to develop your major characters, consider writing up character profiles to refer to as you write your work.Character profiles list a character's personality traits, physical appearance, personal relationships and so on. You should try to write up a character profile for each major character in your book.
Start with the basics. Write down your character's full name and physical details like height, weight, eye color, hair color, and so on. Also, make sure to chart out basic relationship. Lists parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners, and so on.
From here, talk about deeper issues. Lists your character wants, fears, and needs. Talk about what your character likes and dislikes. What does your character want out of life? What about him or herself does your character want to change? Also, include things like religious and political views, as these are important insights to a character's personality.
You may find, as you begin to write, you do not include every detail in your actual book. However, knowing your character's intimately can be helpful for you as a writer. You may find you incorporate a lot of the information from your character profiles in the subtext of your work.

, A character arc represents your character's emotional journey throughout the course of a work. In a character driven book, a character arc is the driving force of your story. Your character's internal arc will be how you figure out the rising action, climax, and falling action of your story.Essentially, your character arc is how we get from Point A to Point B in your story. Let's return to the ballet dancer example. Your main character should go from obsessing over perfection and control to accepting life's ambiguities. How do you get your character to this point?
Think of events that will shape your character. In our example, the ballet dancer's estranged father resurfaces. As your dancer cares for his ailing father, you can include flashbacks to his childhood. This can reveal an amount of chaos that was frightening. You can also use the progression of his father's illness to drive the story forward, each stage of his father's sickness forcing the ballet dancer to recognize how much of life is beyond his control.

, Your character should come with a history attached to him or her. Try writing a brief biography for each character you create. Where was the character born? What was his or her childhood like? Where did he or she go to school? What important events occurred in his or her life? This information is all vital to a character's current personality.


Much like the information in your character profiles, it's unlikely that you'll include every detail of a character's backstory in your book. However, this information may be useful for you as a writer. You can add details subtly or burry them in the context.

A blue line is a family relationship.
Grudges can go a long way in developing characters. A lot of tension in a character driven work comes from characters who dislike each other or have a troubled history.
Focus on how these relationships will change. Will characters grow apart, reconcile, or develop animosity as time goes by?

, Strong opinions can make for interesting, dynamic characters. They can also help move the story forward. How a character's opinion changes over time can be a focal point of that character's arc. Strong opinions can also foster disagreement between characters, creating compelling conflict in a story.Characters with strong opinions can be very driven. This can help keep a character driven story moving. For example, the ballet dancer is of the opinion perfection and success are vital to a life well lived. He may be dismissive of people he sees as lazy. This can create tension in his personal relationships, as his opinions may make him judgmental or overbearing.
Strong opinions often change during the course of a story. Your climax will seem more exciting if your character is forced to abandon opinions he or she has clung to strongly throughout a work.

[],What are some effective ways to engage during class and make a good impression on professors and TAs?,"Asking questions of instructors, providing answers if they pose questions, contributing to discussion sessions, and attending class regularly are effective ways to engage and make a good impression on professors and TAs. Sitting in the front or middle, instead of at the back, can also make it easier to pay attention, put you front and center for the professor to see, and show your interest in the subject matter.",How to Be a Successful College Student," Don't rely on a ""magic number"" of classes you can miss and still do well. Each missed class represents missed content and missed discussion. Some professors weigh participation into your final grade calculation. Even if attendance isn't required, however, you will make a good impression on your professor and TA if you show up to class.Only miss class if you are genuinely sick—too sick to get anything worthwhile out of the lecture.
If you need some incentive, consider the cost of each class hour. The average yearly cost of tuition at a public university is $9,139.Given a 15-week semester with 4 classes each semester, you pay over $25 per class hour for the privilege of being taught. Not going to class is basically the same as setting twenty-five bucks on fire. Would you do that?;
, Your memory is never as good as you think it is. There will probably be plenty of things taking up space in your mind while at school. Taking good notes will keep you engaged in classroom activities (lectures and discussion) and give you a good basis when studying for exams.

, Success in college relies on you preparing outside of class, so spend time reviewing your notes and reading the textbook for each session. When you study, find a quiet space and cut off outside distractions. A good rule of thumb is to spend two hours studying for each hour you spend in class.Study groups—working with other students in your class—can be helpful, but also go off-track easily. Make sure you find a study group that reviews the material, and spends most of its time actually studying, rather than chatting.
Don't cram! Part of being a successful college student is doing more than passing tests; it's retaining the useful information for the real world. When you cram, you might remember enough to pass your exam, but chances are high that you'll forget most of it in a day or two. When you're spending tens of thousands of dollars to learn this stuff, actually remembering it for later is a smart investment.Spacing out your study sessions over a few days is the best way to make sure you remember the material later.Rather than spending a 9-hour marathon studying for a test, for example, start a few days early and study for 1-2 hours each day for 3 or 4 days in a row.

Many times, traumatic events will get compartmentalized and any feelings associated with the event will get pushed aside. Instead of doing this, which can lead to anxiety and depression, write down exactly what happened in as vivid detail as possible. Write down what you felt and what you still feel about the event. This will help you cope and move on.

, When you are having issues with depression and anxiety or you are trying to get over a past trauma, describe what happened and how it made you feel. You can do this by journaling or speaking with someone you trust. Getting it out is better than repressing it. Also, think about the contextual aspects of the traumatic event.

Beginning with your facial muscles, tighten the muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Repeat this down your body with your neck, chest, arms, hands, legs, calves, and feet., Controlled breathing, or diaphragm breathing, is another way to signal your body to begin relaxing and start to calm its stress response, which is often anxiety. Controlled breathing signals your brain to release neurotransmitters, which tells your body that it is no longer in danger and can calm down. Practice diaphragm breathing by taking a full breath making your abdomen expand, hold it, then release.


The timing for this should be five seconds breathing in, hold for five seconds, and then breathe out for five seconds. Take two normal breaths, then repeat the timed, abdominal breathing until you feel your anxiety subside., Distraction is a short term technique that you can use when you are in a situation that may not be appropriate for depression or anxiety, such as at work.

Beginning with your facial muscles, tighten the muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Repeat this down your body with your neck, chest, arms, hands, legs, calves, and feet., Controlled breathing, or diaphragm breathing, is another way to signal your body to begin relaxing and start to calm its stress response, which is often anxiety. Controlled breathing signals your brain to release neurotransmitters, which tells your body that it is no longer in danger and can calm down. Practice diaphragm breathing by taking a full breath making your abdomen expand, hold it, then release.


The timing for this should be five seconds breathing in, hold for five seconds, and then breathe out for five seconds. Take two normal breaths, then repeat the timed, abdominal breathing until you feel your anxiety subside., Distraction is a short term technique that you can use when you are in a situation that may not be appropriate for depression or anxiety, such as at work.

If you are with your children or grandchildren at home and cannot deal with your emotion at that moment, take them for a walk or read a book together.


You can also distract yourself with small activities. Try doing simple math in your head, grabbing a piece of paper and folding it into multiple different shapes, splashing water on your face, or playing a word game. You can also do word or number puzzles like crosswords or Sudoku.

Work from head to toe, and be sure to focus on the sensations you feel when you release the contraction and feel your muscle tension reducing.


Beginning with your facial muscles, tighten the muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Repeat this down your body with your neck, chest, arms, hands, legs, calves, and feet., Controlled breathing, or diaphragm breathing, is another way to signal your body to begin relaxing and start to calm its stress response, which is often anxiety. Controlled breathing signals your brain to release neurotransmitters, which tells your body that it is no longer in danger and can calm down. Practice diaphragm breathing by taking a full breath making your abdomen expand, hold it, then release.


The timing for this should be five seconds breathing in, hold for five seconds, and then breathe out for five seconds.

You will have to actively engage in your therapy sessions, and be honest and open with your doctor. Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a form of talk therapy, has been shown to be the most effective method of treatment for anxiety and depression but requires more commitment and cooperation from you than interpersonal therapy. Instead of just talking out your problems, cognitive behavioral therapy requires your active participation in order for it to work and for you to get better.Be open to trying new things and pushing past your comfort zone. Some doctors assign their patients with ""exercises"" to apply to their everyday life.

, Sometimes depression and anxiety are situational, such as a result of a big change. Other times, it is simply biological and the use of medication can help. If you have been prescribed a medication for your condition, then give it time to work before discontinuing use. It can also take some experimentation on your and your doctor's part in order to find the right medication and dosage for your particular situation. Just be patient and give it time.


Most medications take four to eight weeks to show any effects, so be patient., Comorbidity is the presence of more than one condition in an individual.Comorbidity for depression and anxiety is common, and most psychiatrist will assume you have both until proven otherwise. This is mostly because, for patients, the presentation or subjective experience of symptoms of depression and anxiety are often indistinguishable, meaning that the patient can't tell whether one originated separately from the other.


Because many of the symptoms of depression and anxiety overlap, it is often hard to tease out which symptoms are attributed to which condition. In fact, about 85% of people with depression experience symptoms of anxiety, and about 90% of people with anxiety experience depression.
Comorbidity of any conditions often complicates treatment and makes outcomes less positive, and this is true of anxiety and depression comorbidity as well. A key factor in improving treatment outcomes for comorbid depression and anxiety is the recognition of the comorbidity.Depending on which depression and anxiety diagnoses you have, there could be many overlapping symptoms. For example, depressive ruminations common in Major Depressive Disorder are similar to obsessive worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder, while poor sleep or sleeplessness and poor concentration are common in both Major Depressive Disorder and Post-traumatic stress disorder."
[],How can journaling or talking about traumatic experiences help in dealing with depression and anxiety?,"Talking about traumatic experiences, whether through journaling or conversation, helps express repressed feelings and negates the need to compartmentalize emotions associated with the event. By writing down or speaking about what happened and how it made you feel, it helps in dealing with the anxiety and depression that follow. Remembering other aspects of the event also helps dissolve negative associations. Professional help is however advised in dealing with such traumatic experiences.",How to Cope With Anxiety and Depression," Not only does regular exercise reduce the likelihood of heart disease and other illnesses, it has also been shown to treat both depression and anxiety. There are various explanations for why this occurs. First, exercise releases endorphins, a feel-good chemical in the brain that improves mood. It also reduces certain immune system chemicals that cause depression and raises the body temperature, which promotes relaxation.Regular exercise also helps you get in shape and improve your overall appearance, which for many people, is enough to rid them of their self-doubt.
Endorphins help to inhibit your body’s stress response, which lowers your risk for feeling anxious or developing symptoms of panic throughout the day.
Some studies show that exercise helps to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety just as well as medication. Even just 10 minutes of physical exercise can help alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms as much as a 45-minute workout.Exercise can lower your baseline anxiety or the level of tension or anxiety you experience daily. If you experience a high level of anxiety symptoms daily, exercise can decrease the number or severity of these symptoms that you experience.;
, People who suffer from anxiety tend to turn to alcohol to ease their tension and nervousness. Though alcohol may ease symptoms temporarily, it will actually make them worse in the long run.According to the Dietary Guidelines of America, if you are female, you should have no more than one drink per day. If you are a male, you should no more than two per day.Because alcohol is a depressant, is temporarily suppresses your feelings of anxiety or tension, however, when the alcohol is metabolized and rids the body, your anxiety and depression will rebound.Similar to a spring that has to be pressed down harder and harder, your emotions are held down even more by the alcohol. Once the alcohol is gone, the spring will jump even high than it is when it’s just sitting there. This rebound means that you will likely experience more anxiety the next day, or be more susceptible to stress., The high levels of caffeine that are present in coffee can worsen anxiety symptoms in both the short and long run. Caffeine is a stimulant which makes your body and nervous system wired and alert, which increases your risk of worsening or developing depression and anxiety throughout the day.By limiting your caffeine intake, you can help control over your body’s physical response and prevent experiencing anxiety symptoms throughout the day. Consider switching to decaf, or drinking tea instead. Some tea, such as green tea, still contains some caffeine, but won't have the same extreme effects of coffee.

, Nicotine, much like caffeine, is a stimulant and can produce many of the same effects on the body associated with other stimulants, such as feeling wired. Nicotine is in tobacco products and is also in non-tobacco products such as nicotine gum.


Realize that quitting smoking is a difficult task and should only be taken on during non-stressful times. However, doing so could greatly reduce your symptoms of anxiety and depression., Depression is a painful experience which affects your mood, but also energy and motivation. If you are depressed, it may be difficult to focus or you may be tempted to stay in bed all day. You may be anxious if you don't know how your day will go. Try to continue your regular routines as much as possible, and avoid letting your moods dictate what you do and what you get done.


If you normally don't have much structure, it may benefit you to begin to structure your days. Plan out your days, making sure they are full but not overwhelming and stick to the schedule so you can continue to function in your daily life., If you are suffering from anxiety, it may be because you are worried, uncertain, or nervous about the future. If you are suffering from depression, it may be because you are constantly dwelling on the past, ruminating about things gone wrong, or thinking self-defeating thoughts. Learning to appreciate the present moment will have a remarkable impact on your life. However, this is no easy feat, but it will help you to separate your feelings from your thoughts.


The best way to stop dwelling on the past or obsessing over the future is to notice when these kinds of thoughts arise throughout your daily life. When they do, then acknowledge them, label them thoughts, and let them fade away.
Try to focus on what is happening around you and what your activities entail. Take stock of the people around you and how you feel performing whatever activity you are taking part in. It will help you come out of the past and focus on the present. Keep trying and you'll get to a state of mindfulness.

, Regular meditation practice has been shown to ease symptoms of stress and anxiety.Mindfulness can also help you feel more connected to other, it can help you gain more control over your emotions, and increase your ability to think about situations in a new light. Consider joining a meditation center or group in your area. Most centers offer free meditation instruction and have weekly open houses.


To practice mindfulness and meditate, take a few moments every day to close your eyes, relax your muscles, and focus all of your attention on your breath. If a thought arises, then acknowledge it and let it disappear. The more you do this, the more you will eventually be able to incorporate it into your daily life. , Your inner critic is self-defeating or exaggerated thoughts that keep your feelings of depression and anxiety at large. Your inner critic may say things like “I’m a failure” or “There is nothing I can do, and I’m stuck.” Your inner critic may also latch onto one of your worries or thoughts that cause anxiety and then cause a snowball effect of more and more worrisome thoughts. Thoughts such as these keep you from being able to see choices in your life, make you feel incapable or stuck, or perpetuate worries, depression, or anxiety.


Learn to quiet your inner critic to lessen the effect is has on your perspective and your mood. To quiet your inner critic, practice catching your unproductive thoughts as they come up, and be prepared with a productive counter-thought or mantra that focus on your strengths.If you think “There is nothing I can do, I am stuck” Test if that is true. Make a list of all your possible options. Change your inner critic to say “Although my options are not the best, I do have a choice, and I choose_________ because….”
If you have a thought that pops into year head that triggers a worry, fear, or other anxiety symptoms, be sure to counter you inner critic with a reassuring statement or phrase such as “I know the likelihood of that happening is very low, so I have nothing to worry about” or “Everything is going to be ok, I am fine in this moment and this feeling will pass.”

, Many people are depressed or anxious because they are holding on to one or more traumatic experiences from the past, and they are going through a significant change, or have lost a loved one. While it is extremely difficult to erase these memories and go through these experiences, there are things you can do to reduce their prevalence in your everyday life.


Grieve when you need to. If you feel the need to cry or scream, then do it. Catharsis is a necessary part of the healing process. You can even look for grief groups in your area for support through your time of grief. If you are grieving, remember that it is a normal process with many emotions involved. You may not feel like yourself some time. However, if you continue to feel symptoms of grief long after losing your loved one, you should contact a therapist or mental health professional.
Write out what happened and how it made you feel. There are many feelings involved with traumatic events that often need to be expressed. Many times, traumatic events will get compartmentalized and any feelings associated with the event will get pushed aside. Instead of doing this, which can lead to anxiety and depression, write down exactly what happened in as vivid detail as possible. Write down what you felt and what you still feel about the event. This will help you cope and move on.

, When you are having issues with depression and anxiety or you are trying to get over a past trauma, describe what happened and how it made you feel. You can do this by journaling or speaking with someone you trust. Getting it out is better than repressing it. Also, think about the contextual aspects of the traumatic event. Remembering other aspects of the day the event happened, such as the weather or who else was there, can help you dissolve some of the negative associations.If you are dealing with memories of a traumatic past, it is essential that you seek professional help to deal with the painful emotions caused by trauma.

, Anxiety can be a gripping experience and can make your feel as though you are losing control. There are some techniques you can try to get your body and mind to slow and calm.

The money saved will stay in your pocket, essentially serving as a small raise.",How to Give Yourself a Raise1," Cut down on everything except for fixed expenses. Fixed expenses like your rent or car insurance may be hard to change, but other expenses like eating out or entertainment spending can be adjusted. See if you can trim non fixed expenses down by 5% or even 10%If you are in the habit of eating out at lunchtime, try making yourself lunch before work.
If you spend a lot at your local pub, try inviting your friends over for drinks more of the time to save on alcohol.;
, If you get a large tax refund from the government every year, you are basically loaning the government money without interest. Get your current employer to adjust your tax withholding amount, and place the savings into a savings account or an investment portfolio. You will be giving yourself a raise equal to the amount of interest you make on this money during the year., If you are currently in debt, the single best way to give yourself a raise is to get out of debt. The interest you are paying on your debt could be money in your pocket. If you can get out of debt, you will be giving yourself a raise equal to the amount of interest that you would otherwise be stuck paying., Review your monthly statement and look at all of your subscriptions. Looking carefully at all of your product and entertainment subscriptions such as cable or new subscriptions, consider cutting as many as possible. It is possible that you are spending a great deal of money on entertainment products that you no longer use.

If you are paying for a landline, try cutting it and using your mobile phone instead.
If you have a music service subscription, consider cutting it.

, Look over your monthly statement and figure out how much you are spending on your monthly services such as your phone and internet bills. See if you can find the same service from a different company for less money. If you identify a cheaper version of the service, try phoning your current provider to see if they will match the price or switch your service provider.


If you decide to switch service provider, you should check to see whether your current provider will penalize you with service withdrawal charges.

, If you spend a lot on vacations, try a stay-at-home vacation or staycation. Instead of spending a fortune on airplane tickets, stay at home for the holidays. The money you would have spent on the vacation will stay in your pocket as a small raise. On your staycation, you can go to a local museum, go see a show, or enjoy an afternoon with a favorite novel at your local café., If you are currently living on your own, you could save money on rent by getting a roommate or two. You will get to meet new people and save on rent, since it is cheaper to rent a shared apartment than rent one on your own. The money you save will be in your pocket at the end of each month. Depending on the city you live in, you could be giving yourself a raise of $500 to $1500 per month."

[],What are some activities that can foster a strong bond between siblings?,"Participating together in various holiday outings and annual events like carving a pumpkin or building a snowman can help strengthen the bond between siblings. Shared experiences, such as bowling or playing in their rooms, can give their relationship a solid foundation. Identifying activities that they both enjoy, like going to a baseball game, can also help in bonding.",How to Improve Your Children's Sibling Relationships2," One of the great ways you can help strengthen your children’s bond is by encouraging them to participate together in various holiday outings and annual events. For instance, supply your kids with a pumpkin and allow them (when they reach an age where they are able) to cut it into a jack-o-lantern (with adult supervision). During the winter, build a snowman in the yard, or provide them with the means to construct their own gingerbread houses., If your kids never have opportunities to bond and spend time together, they won’t have a strong relationship. Take your kids bowling, or to the park, or just allow them time to play in their rooms together. These shared experiences can give your kids’ relationship a solid foundation.Young children who play together will fight at some point, too. But unless their conflicts occur frequently (at a rate of more than one conflict per five positive interactions), don’t encourage them to stay apart from each other.
If you know that your kids get cranky and are more likely to fight at certain times of day – for instance, in the late evening – don’t schedule joint playtime during those times.

, Growing up, especially in a small house, kids might feel that they are overexposed to their siblings. This feeling that their siblings are always around might make them feel trapped and frustrated, leading to a deteriorating relationship. It is just as important, therefore, to give your kids time away from each other as it is to provide time when they can be together.Instead of taking both children everywhere with you or insisting that they play together when one or both don’t really want to, provide opportunities where they can be apart for a time.
For instance, take one child to the zoo this weekend, then take your other child to the baseball game next weekend. That way, you’ll be able to spend an equal amount of time with each even though the time spent isn’t always together.

, If there is a significant difference in your kids’ backgrounds, find ways to help them bond that acknowledge and accommodate their differences. For example, if one child is 5 and the other is 15, it might seem hard to find ways for them to bond. Identify activities that they both like to do and facilitate opportunities to enjoy these activities together.For instance, if both children enjoy baseball, allow the older child to take the younger one to a baseball game.
Without relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent, encourage your older child to watch out for their younger sibling in certain situations. For instance, if both children ride the same bus to school, encourage the much older child to protect the younger one.

, If your siblings feel like they are in competition with each other, then it may be difficult for them to be supportive of each other. To improve their relationship with each other, try to encourage helping behaviors among your children.

For example, you might encourage your children to be supportive of each other during stressful times, such as before a big game that one of your children will be playing in, or before one of your children has a big test at school.
Try saying something like, “Don’t forget to wish your sister good luck on her history test today! She is really worried about it and it will mean a lot to her if you give her some words of encouragement.” Or, “Let’s all cheer for Danny when he comes out onto the field! It will make him happy to know we are all here to support him.”

[],What are the rules for determining the residency status of a student at a university?,"Every state has different rules for determining residency and these rules have to be adhered to by colleges and universities. Residency requirements are typically mentioned in the state statute. As a general guideline, most requirements for residency are the same from state to state and many require an independent student to furnish proof of financial independence. You or your parent must have resided in the state for a full calendar year before residency can be granted, though this period varies in some cases. Also, evidence of the intent to live in the state on a long-term basis needs to be provided.",How to Establish Residency," Most states have their own rules for determining residency, and most colleges and universities will only consider you a resident if you meet the rules set by the state the school is in.Residency requirements are usually stated within the state statute. Look for the statute online. If you are unable to find it, the university registrar should be able to tell you what the residency requirements are.
Note that most requirements for residency are the same from state to state, so following the generic guidelines will typically be enough. You should still find out if there are any differences for your state, though.;
, The burden of proof will either lie with the applicant or the applicant's parent based on whether or not the applicant is still legally dependent on that parent.


Dependents must still be under the age of 24 before the end of the calendar year arrives.
Additionally, the student must rely on the parent financially to be considered a dependent of that parent, but that parent does not necessarily need to claim the student as a dependent on his or her taxes.
Students who are independent must prove presence, intent, and financial independence by themselves. Students who are dependent will need to prove the presence and intent of the parents they reside with. When a student's parents are divorced, residency must be proven for the parent who resides with and financially supports that student.

, You or the parent you are dependent upon must reside within the state for a full calendar year before residency can be granted.Some states have a different time requirement. For instance, Alaska requires proof of physical presence for two full calendar years, while Arkansas only requires physical presence within the state for six months.
This time requirement may also vary based on whether you are dependent or independent. For example, Nebraska does not have a minimum time for dependent students, but independent students must prove that they have been physically present in the state for at least one year.

, You or your parents must also demonstrate your intention to remain in the state on a long-term basis.


Essentially, you need to prove that you intend to remain in the state as a resident throughout and beyond the school year.
This requirement may vary based on your dependency status. In some cases, a student who intends to remain in the state may still qualify for residency even if the parent moves out of state.

, Many states require independent students to provide proof of their financial independence.


This is not a requirement that dependent students need to worry about.
Note that none of the proof you provide indicating financial independence may conflict with your proof of presence or intent.

, In addition to proving residency in the state of your university, you must also have no residential ties to any other state.As a general rule, any type of document that can be used to prove residency in the state of your university can also be used to prove residency in another state. Any record indicating that you have recently applied for residency in another state will also work against you.

, Even though some private documents may show that you have been present in the state for the past year, the most effective documents will be those that are tied to the state or federal government.


The most common forms of government-issued proof include:

A voter registration card
Registration with Selective Service in the state.
A filed ""Declaration of Domicile"" form with the county clerk
State and federal income tax returns
High school diploma from a school within the state


Activities showing that you are regularly present within the state might help as supporting evidence but should not be relied upon completely. Such evidence most often includes memberships to local organizations and club

, Proof of intent is less objective, but in general, any document showing that you are establishing a life within the state can be used to help prove your intent.Common examples include:

State driver's license
Vehicle registration within the state
State hunting and/or fishing license
Local bank account
Local library card
License of marriage or divorce within the state
Utility bills from within the state
Proof of state-aided health or welfare


Owning a home or renting an apartment within the state may help, but since many people own vacation homes out of state, some colleges won't accept this as proof. Only provide this proof if it somehow demonstrates that the home you own in the state is your principal home.Similarly, proof of employment within the state may also help, but some people work in a state they do not live in. Some universities may accept records of full-time employment, but others will not.

, If you need to prove financial independence when establishing residency, you will need to satisfy at least one requirement demonstrating your independence.


In most states, you can be considered independent if you are at least 24 years old by the end of the calendar year.
If you are a single undergraduate student who has not been claimed as a dependent by anyone for at least two years, and can demonstrate self-sufficiency through lease agreements or similar documents, you can usually be considered independent, as well.
You may also be considered financially independent if you are married, a veteran of the U.S. military, a ward of the court, a legal orphan, or responsible for legal dependents other than a spouse., If you have legal documents to prove that you are a resident within another state, they may cause your university to reject your claim of residency for the university's state.


Evidence that can be particularly damaging includes:Failure to pay state income tax
Failure to obey any law that applies to permanent residents of the state
Employment in another state, especially a non-bordering state
Ownership of a home in another state
Extended absence from the state, excluding absences required of military members



, In most states, residency status will be granted or denied by the university. As such, you will need to complete the university's residency application.


Fill out the form accurately and completely. Missing or inaccurate information will delay the process and may prevent your claim of residency from being accepted.
In some cases, both you and your parents (or custodial parent) may need to sign the application.
Make sure that you submit the form before the due date established by your university.

, You'll need at least two government-issued documents establishing residency, and at least one of these documents must satisfy any time limit established by the state.


There is no such thing as having too many documents proving residency. Submit all of the proof you have, just in case one document gets rejected.

, Some of these documents might be government-issued, while others won't be.


Regardless of who issued the document, it is recommended that you provide every possible document proving your intent. Since intent is more subjective than physical presence, you will need even more proof to defend this claim.

, If you are an independent student, you will also need to provide at least one document proving your financial independence when you submit your application.


Even if you proved financial independence on your admissions application or on previously submitted financial aid forms, you should still submit your proof again when attempting to establish residency.

, After submitting your application and proof, you must wait for the tuition classification officer to make a decision. Most colleges and universities will inform you of their decision when it has been made.


The decision is only binding at that particular university. If one university denies your claim of residency, it is possible that another university within the same state may grant your claim.
In some cases, you might be able to appeal the decision with that college or university. There usually won't be a way to appeal the decision to a power beyond that educational institution, however.

[],What is the best type of paint to use in an airless sprayer and how can it be prepared?,"Latex paint is typically used for airless sprayers. Before use, it must be thinned out to ensure it can flow easily through the nozzle. Approximately a 1/4 cup of water or chemical thinner is added for every gallon of paint used. After mixing, some troubleshooting may be necessary to achieve the correct thickness by loading the paint into the sprayer and checking the coverage. If the paint is not spraying evenly, more thinner may need to be added. It's worth noting that chemical thinners, which are available at paint and hardware stores, generally work more effectively than water and do not interfere with the paint's base properties. Lastly, to prevent nozzle blockages, solid paint clumps should be removed by straining the paint into another bucket.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer1," Larger tips generally require more pressure, but can cover more ground effectively. Narrower tips, on the other hand, are best for precision work. If you're unsure about the sort of tip you should be using, contact a hardware professional and give her the details of your project.;
, Latex paint works for airless sprayers, but it must first be thinned out in order to flow easily through the nozzle.Add 1/4 cup of water or chemical thinner for every gallon of paint you're using, then mix the two together thoroughly. You may have to experiment with different thicknesses of paint. Load some into your paint sprayer and check the coverage. If it's not spraying evenly, you may need to add more thinner.


Latex paint is the default paint for airless sprayers.
Chemical thinners are available from paint and hardware stores as well. These work more effectively than water and don't work against the paint's default properties.
The type of paint you use for your project will depend on the surface.

, No matter how well you mix the paint, there may still be little clumps of solid paint. It doesn't take much to clog an airless sprayer nozzle. Take a strainer and strain your paint into another bucket, catching the solid bits and discarding them.

, Attach your siphon hose to the back and place it gently in your paint bucket. It's a good idea to do this prior to priming. That way, you'll be able to tell priming is done because paint will start coming through the nozzle.

, Luckily, this is a fairly straightforward operation, as many airless sprayers will have a ""Prime"" setting. If your airless sprayer isn't priming successfully, it may help to give the device a slight tap with a hammer.This can loosen any clogged paint inside the sprayer.


Keep the nozzle face downward in a bucket to account for paint drips while you're getting the sprayer ready.

, Making sure your sprayer's in working order before you use it can help prevent big messes. Check the hose for microfractures. Check the nozzle and make sure the filter is clear. Give the paint a quick test run on a surface to make sure the paint's being distributed evenly.

"
[],How should one prepare an airless sprayer before painting?,"Prepare your airless sprayer by connecting the siphon hose at the back and placing it in your paint bucket. This step should be done prior to priming. Priming is considered complete when paint starts to appear from the nozzle. Many sprayers will have a specific 'Prime' setting to facilitate this process. If the sprayer is not priming successfully, lightly tapping it with a hammer may loosen any clogged paint inside. During this setup phase, keep the nozzle face downward in another bucket to manage paint drips. Also, it's important to pre-check the sprayer for functionality. This includes looking for microfractures in the hose, verifying that the nozzle filter is clear, and testing the paint distribution on a surface before starting your project.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer1," Larger tips generally require more pressure, but can cover more ground effectively.

, No matter how well you mix the paint, there may still be little clumps of solid paint. It doesn't take much to clog an airless sprayer nozzle. Take a strainer and strain your paint into another bucket, catching the solid bits and discarding them.

, Attach your siphon hose to the back and place it gently in your paint bucket. It's a good idea to do this prior to priming. That way, you'll be able to tell priming is done because paint will start coming through the nozzle.

, Luckily, this is a fairly straightforward operation, as many airless sprayers will have a ""Prime"" setting. If your airless sprayer isn't priming successfully, it may help to give the device a slight tap with a hammer.This can loosen any clogged paint inside the sprayer.


Keep the nozzle face downward in a bucket to account for paint drips while you're getting the sprayer ready.

, Making sure your sprayer's in working order before you use it can help prevent big messes. Check the hose for microfractures. Check the nozzle and make sure the filter is clear. Give the paint a quick test run on a surface to make sure the paint's being distributed evenly.
